            <h2>Photothermomechanicaly Efficient, Low-Cost, High-Cycle-Life, Hybrid MXene-Polymer Actuators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Iiyoshi, Georgios Korres, Orsolya Nagy, Gabriel Roldán, Panče Naumov, Stefan Schramm, Mohamad Eid</p>
            <p>Photothermomechanical polymer film actuators stand out among the dynamic components available for soft robotics due to a combination of assets, such as capability for rapid energy transduction, wireless control, and ease of miniaturization. Despite their anticipated superior performance, several design challenges remain. These include high operational temperatures, inadequate mechanical output relative to the radiation energy provided, limited durability during repeated use, and high production costs; such factors hinder the scalability of these actuating materials in practical applications. Here, we report a viable solution by substituting performance-enhancing nanoparticles with MXenes--carbon-based, two-dimensional materials known for their theoretical photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 100%. This led to the development of MXene-dispersed polymer trilayer actuators (MPTAs). Extensive photothermal and thermomechanical characterization demonstrated superior performance compared to previously reported actuators, with a reduced shed power demand (0.1 mW cm$^{-2}$ $^\circ$C$^{-1}$), substantial bending capacity per irradiation power per time (0.1$^\circ$ mW$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$ s$^{-1}$), and enhanced cyclic longevity, with fatigueless operation of at least 1,000 cycles. We demonstrate three applications: A kirigami-inspired flower, parallel manipulator, and soft gripper. Additionally, these materials are cost-effective; thus, they are the optimal choice for long-term, reversible operation with efficient heat-to-work transduction.</p>

            <h2>Statistical Mechanics of Paraparticles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nupoor Thakur, Navinder Singh</p>
            <p>Quantum mechanics broadly classifies the particles into two categories: $(1)$ fermions and $(2)$ bosons. Fermions are half-integer spin particles, obeying Pauli's exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Whereas bosons are integer spin particles, not obeying Pauli's exclusion principle, and obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. However, there are two exceptions to this standard case: first, anyons, which exist in 2-dimensional systems, and secondly, paraparticles, which can exist in any dimension. Paraparticles follow their non-trivial parastatistics, obeying their generalised exclusion principle. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of the foundations of paraparticle statistics established in \cite{wang2025particle}. We extend this work further and then derive an important expression for the heat capacity of paraparticles for a specific case, which would provide a handle for the experimental detection of paraparticles in appropriate systems.</p>

            <h2>Majorana edge modes in number-conserving models with long-range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaden Thomas-Markarian, Kartiek Agarwal, Ivar Martin</p>
            <p>Topological superconductors are believed to host exotic quasiparticle excitations known as Majorana zero-modes, with much of the evidence based on BCS mean-field theory. The direct application of mean-field arguments is tenuous in finite, isolated systems relevant in some experiments. Here, we numerically study fermion number-conserving models with long-range interactions, which under periodic boundary conditions exhibit robust topological and non-topological superconductivity, tuned by the strength of interaction [1]. We find evidence that, on the topological side, Majorana edge modes appear in open chains, manifesting as the vanishing of the energy splitting between odd- and even-parity ground states with increasing system size. Additionally, off-diagonal two-point correlation functions show nonlocal, parity-dependent edge effects consistent with Majorana phenomenology. We develop a correlation-based method revealing the spatial structure of Majorana modes in this fully interacting many-body setting.</p>

            <h2>Nonadiabatic Wave-Packet Dynamics: Nonadiabatic Metric, Quantum Geometry, and Analogue Gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yafei Ren, M. E. Sanchez Barrero</p>
            <p>We develop a unified theory for the nonadiabatic wave-packet dynamics of Bloch electrons subject to slowly varying spatial and temporal perturbations. Extending the conventional wave-packet ansatz to include interband contributions, we derive equations for the interband coefficients using the time-dependent variational principle, referred to as the wave-packet coefficient equation. Solving these equations and integrating out interband contributions yields the leading-order nonadiabatic corrections to the wave-packet Lagrangian. These corrections appear in three forms: (i) a nonadiabatic metric in real and momentum space, which we identify with the energy-gap-renormalized quantum metric, (ii) modified Berry connections associated with the motion of the wave-packet center, and (iii) an energy correction arising from spatial and temporal variations of the Hamiltonian. This metric reformulates the wave-packet dynamics as geodesic motion in phase space, enabling an analogue-gravity perspective in condensed matter systems. As an application, we analyze one-dimensional Dirac electron systems under a slowly varying exchange field $\bm{m}$. Our results demonstrate that variations in the magnitude of $\bm{m}$ are important to nonadiabatic dynamics, in sharp contrast to the adiabatic regime where directional variations of $\bm{m}$ are crucial.</p>

            <h2>Universal Mott quantum criticality in a modified periodic Anderson model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujan K. K., N. S. Vidhyadhiraja</p>
            <p>Mott quantum criticality is a central theme in correlated electron physics, observed in systems featuring both continuous zero-temperature transitions and those with finite-temperature critical endpoints. Within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such criticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified periodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of genuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature. Using DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we investigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our central finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical resistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\text{met}} = 0.76$ and $z_{\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively. These values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both transitions are governed by a common universality class. We further substantiate the presence of local quantum criticality by demonstrating robust $\omega/T$ scaling in single- and two-particle correlation functions. Finally, we identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the distinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of the QCP. These results establish the MPAM as a canonical model for investigating genuine Mott quantum criticality and support the existence of a universal framework for this fundamental phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Strange diffusivity of incoherent metal in half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngmin Eom, Igor S. Tupitsyn, Nikolay V. Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov, Evgeny Kozik, Aaram J. Kim</p>
            <p>We study charge transport across the metal-insulator crossover in the half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model, with particular emphasis on precision control. The dynamic current-current correlation function is obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit, and the optical conductivity is extracted using numerical analytic continuation. To achieve this, we develop a multiscale approach: the non-perturbative low-frequency behavior is computed using the unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, while the high-frequency physics is captured via a self-consistent (semi-)analytic diagrammatic theory. We found that across a broad temperature range where the DC resistivity displays anomalous scaling, $\sim T^\alpha$ with $0<\alpha\lesssim 1$, the Nernst-Einstein relation implies the diffusion constant with the characteristic $\sim 1/\sqrt{T}$ "strange metal" behavior. It was also revealed that the insulating regime is entered through a peculiar non-Fermi liquid state-which we call a Pseudogap Metal-characterized by insulating charge compressibility coexisting with metallic transport. Diagrammatically, the high-temperature incoherent transport is captured by the dressed polarization bubble, whereas near the metal-insulator crossover, the effective interaction vertex between opposite-spin particles is responsible for transferring the Drude weight to a high-frequency continuum.</p>

            <h2>Free-carrier screening unlocks high electron mobility in ultrawide bandgap semiconductor CaSnO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayi Gong, Chuanyu Zhang, Wenjie Hu, Jin-Jian Zhou</p>
            <p>Alkaline earth stannates have emerged as promising transparent conducting oxides due to their wide band gaps and high room-temperature electron mobilities. Among them, CaSnO$_3$ possesses the widest band gap, yet reported mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO$_3$ across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ~10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO$_3$, establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent and high-power electronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Landau-de Gennes Modelling of Confinement Effects and Cybotactic Clusters in Bent-Core Nematic Liquid Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yucen Han, Prabakaran Rajamanickam, Bedour Alturki, Apala Majumdar</p>
            <p>We study bent-core nematic (BCN) systems in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) settings, focusing on the role of cybotactic clusters, phase transitions, confinement effects and applied external fields. We propose a generalised version of Madhusudhana's two-state model for BCNs in [Madhusudana NV, Physical Review E, 96(2), 022710] with two order parameters: $\mathbf{Q}_g$ to describe the ambient ground-state (GS) molecules and $\mathbf{Q}_c$ to describe the ordering within the cybotactic clusters. The equilibria are modelled by minimisers of an appropriately defined free energy, with an empirical coupling term between $\mathbf{Q}_g$ and $\mathbf{Q}_c$. We demonstrate two phase transitions in spatially homogeneous 3D BCN systems at fixed temperatures: a first-order nematic-paranematic transition followed by a paranematic-isotropic phase transition driven by the GS-cluster coupling. We also numerically compute and give heuristic insights into solution landscapes of confined BCN systems on 2D square domains, tailored by the GS-cluster coupling, temperature and external fields. This benchmark example illustrates the potential of this generalised model to capture tunable director profiles, cluster properties and macroscopic biaxiality.</p>

            <h2>Discovery of nodal-line superconductivity in chiral crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian Shang, Jianzhou Zhao, Lun-Hui Hu, Weikang Wu, Keqi Xia, Mukkattu O. Ajeesh, Michael Nicklas, Yang Xu, Qingfeng Zhan, Dariusz J. Gawryluk, Ming Shi, Toni Shiroka</p>
            <p>Chiral crystals, whose key feature is the structural handedness, host exotic quantum phenomena driven by the interplay of band topology, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and electronic correlations. Due to the limited availability of suitable chiral-crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of unconventional SC in the La(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials by combining muon-spin spectroscopy, band-structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family, characterized by a double-helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold fermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi behaves as a fully-gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4$d$-Rh by 5$d$-Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of topological nodal-line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the nodal-line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength. Such an exotic mechanism expands our conventional understanding of material candidates for unconventional SC, which typically rely on a significantly anisotropic SOC to promote the triplet pairing. Our work establishes a new type of phase diagram, which provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering unconventional SC in chiral crystals. Furthermore, it calls for renewed investigations of unconventional SC in other widely studied superconductors with a chiral structure.</p>

            <h2>From diamond to BC8 to simple cubic and back: kinetic pathways to post-diamond carbon phases from metadynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Martoňák, Sergey Galitskiy, Azat Tipeev, Joseph M. Gonzalez, Ivan I. Oleynik</p>
            <p>The experimental observation of elusive post-diamond carbon phases at extreme pressures remains a major challenge in high-pressure science. Using metadynamics with coordination-number-based collective variables and SNAP machine-learned interatomic potential, we uncover atomistic mechanisms governing the transformation of cubic and hexagonal diamond into post-diamond phases above 1.5 TPa. The transition initiates via homogeneous nucleation of nanoscale liquid droplets, which rapidly crystallize into either BC8 (below 1.8 TPa) or simple cubic phases (above 2.1 TPa), once the liquid nucleus surpasses a critical size. Favorable conditions for synthesizing BC8 are identified near 1.8 TPa and 3500--5000 K. Decompression pathways from simple cubic and BC8 phases were also simulated to study possible experimental recovery of post-diamond carbon allotropes at ambient conditions. We also find a new metastable low-enthalpy structure with four-coordinated carbon atoms and space group P222. Our insights provide a theoretical foundation for experimental discovery of ultra-dense carbon phases under extreme conditions.</p>

            <h2>Sliding-induced ferrovalley polarization and possible antiferromagnetic half-metal in bilayer altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Zhang, Shihao Zhang</p>
            <p>Altermagnets, a newly discovered class of materials, exhibit zero net magnetization while hosting spin-split electronic bands. However, monolayer altermagnets maintain degenerate band gaps at the high-symmetry X and Y points in the Brillouin zone, manifesting a paravalley phase characterized by unpolarized valley states. In this work, we demonstrate that spontaneously broken valley degeneracy can be achieved through interlayer sliding in engineered M$_2$A$_2$B and M$_2$AA$'$B bilayer altermagnets by first-principles calculations and minimal microscopic model. We propose a promising route to achieve antiferromagnetic half-metal driven by sliding and emergent ferrovalley phase without applied electric field, which is realized in the V$_2$SSeO engineered bilayer. Our calculations also reveal that Mo$_2$O$_2$O exhibits the largest valley splitting gap of ~0.31 eV, making it a promising candidate for valley-spin valve devices. Furthermore, band structure calculations on Mo$_2$AA$'$O materials demonstrate that increasing the difference in atomic number ($\Delta$Z) between A and A$'$ site atoms effectively enhances valley polarization. This work establishes a novel platform for discovering and controlling ferrovalley states in altermagnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Probing the Nanoscale Excitonic Landscape and Quantum Confinement of Excitons in Gated Monolayer Semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueh-Chun Wu, Bogdan Dryzhakov, Huan Zhao, Ivan Vlassiouk, Kyle Kelley, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Jun Yan, Benjamin Lawrie</p>
            <p>Engineering and probing excitonic properties at the nanoscale remains a central challenge in quantum photonics and optoelectronics. While exciton confinement via electrical control and strain engineering has been demonstrated in 2D semiconductors, substantial nanoscale heterogeneity limits the scalability of 2D quantum photonic device architectures. In this work, we use cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to probe the excitonic landscape of monolayer $WS_2$ under electrostatic gating. Exploiting the high spatial resolution of the converged electron beam, we resolve a homojunction arising between gated and ungated regions. Moreover, we reveal an exciton confinement channel arising from an unconventional doping mechanism driven by the interplay between the electron beam and the applied gate fields. These findings offer new insights into the optoelectronic behavior of monolayer semiconductors under the combined influence of electron-beam excitation and electrostatic gating. Our approach provides a pathway for exciton manipulation at the nanoscale and opens opportunities for controlling quantum-confined exciton transport in two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Shot noise as a probe for Andreev reflection in graphene-based heterojunctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahrukh Salim, Poornima Shakya</p>
            <p>Shot noise emerges due to the discrete nature of charge transport and provides direct access to the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms governing current flow in mesoscopic conductors. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum shot noise offers a direct and robust fingerprint of Andreev reflection, distinguishing between retro and specular processes in graphene-superconductor, graphene-superconductor-graphene, and superconductor-graphene-superconductor junctions. At the graphene-superconductor interface, exact reflection amplitudes obtained from full wavefunction matching within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism capture retro and specular regimes. The associated Fano factor exhibits distinct Fermi-level-dependent signatures, with retro Andreev reflection suppressing and specular Andreev reflection enhancing the shot noise. Extensions to graphene-superconductor-graphene and superconductor-graphene-superconductor configurations reveal how the transmission spectrum and, consequently, the noise profile are modified in the presence of multiple interfaces, coherent quasiparticle interference, and superconducting phase variations. Our findings establish shot noise spectroscopy as a potent and experimentally viable probe for differentiating Andreev reflection types in graphene-based quantum devices, providing complementary insights beyond conventional conductance measurements.</p>

            <h2>Dynamically generated correlations in a trapped bosonic gas via frequency quenches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikhil Mesquita, Manas Kulkarni, Satya N. Majumdar, Sanjib Sabhapandit</p>
            <p>We study a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap subjected to repeated quantum quenches, where the trap frequency is switched from one value to another after a random time duration drawn from an exponential distribution. Each cycle contains two steps: (i) changing the trap frequency to enable unitary evolution under a Hamiltonian, and (ii) reapplying the original trap at stochastic times to cool the gas back to its initial state. This protocol effectively makes it an open quantum system and drives it into a unique nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). We analytically and numerically characterize the NESS, uncovering a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure in the joint probability density function (JPDF) of the positions. The JPDF in the CIID structure is a product of Gaussians with a common random variance, which is then averaged with respect to its distribution, making the JPDF non-factorizable, giving rise to long-range emergent dynamical correlations. The average density profile of the gas shows significant deviations from the initial Gaussian shape. We further compute the order and the gap statistics, revealing universal scaling in both bulk and edge regimes. We also analyze the full counting statistics, exposing rich parameter-dependent structure. Our results demonstrate how stochastic quenches can generate nontrivial correlations in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>The ilmenite NiTiO3 consists of a buckled honeycomb lattice, with the Ni spins aligned ferromagnetically in-plane and antiferromagnetically out-of-plane. Using neutron spectroscopy, the magnetic structure and the dynamics were investigated as a function of temperature. Dispersive acoustic bands and nearly dispersionless optical bands at ~3.7 meV are described by a highly anisotropy Heisenberg model with stronger antiferromagnetic (AFM) out-of-plane, weaker ferromagnetic (FM) in-plane interactions and an anisotropy gap of 0.95 meV. The order parameter yields a critical exponent between the Heisenberg and two-dimensional Ising models, consistent with highly anisotropic Heisenberg systems. The frustration parameter ~ 2 supports a weakly frustrated system.</p>

            <h2>Josephson Dynamics in 2D Ring-shaped Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koon Siang Gan, Vijay Pal Singh, Luigi Amico, Rainer Dumke</p>
            <p>We investigate Josephson transport in a fully closed, two-dimensional superfluid circuit formed by a ring-shaped 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate that contains two optical barriers acting as movable weak links. Translating these barriers at controlled speeds imposes a steady bias current, enabling direct mapping of the current-chemical-potential (I-{\Delta}{\mu}) characteristics. For narrow junctions (w \approx 1{\mu}m) the circuit exhibits a pronounced dc branch that terminates at a critical current I_c = 9(1) x 10^3 s^{-1}; above this threshold the system switches to an ac, resistive regime. Classical-field simulations that include the moving barriers quantitatively reproduce both the nonlinear I-{\Delta}{\mu} curve and the measured I_c, validating the underlying microscopic picture. Analysis of the ensuing phase dynamics shows that dissipation is mediated by the nucleation and traversal of vortex-antivortex pairs through the junctions, while the bulk condensate remains globally phase-locked \textemdash direct evidence of the ring's topological constraint enforcing quantized circulation. These results establish a cold-atom analogue of a SQUID in which Josephson dynamics can be resolved at the single-vortex level, providing a versatile platform for atomtronic circuit elements, non-reciprocal Josephson devices, and on-chip Sagnac interferometers for multi-axis rotation sensing.</p>

            <h2>Sub-GHz Breathing Dynamics of Magnetic Hopfions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Tejo, Rubén M. Otxoa</p>
            <p>Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons whose static stability has recently been confirmed in experiments, yet their dynamical modes remain largely unexplored. Here we combine micromagnetic simulations and analytical modelling to characterise the fundamental breathing excitation of hopfions. We show that the breathing mode corresponds to a coherent oscillation of both the hopfion core diameter and the shell width, while preserving the topological charge. An analytical domain-wall interaction model explains the weak field dependence of the shell thickness and yields a closed-form expression for the restoring stiffness. From this curvature and the collective-coordinate inertia, we derive an estimated breathing frequency in excellent agreement with micromagnetic spectra. The ability to capture the hopfion dynamics quantitatively from material constants highlights a direct route to experimental detection by ferromagnetic resonance or Brillouin light scattering, and establishes a framework for frequency-encoded control in reconfigurable spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Topology of Fermi seas and geometry of their boundaries for free particles in one and two-dimensional lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillermo R. Zemba</p>
            <p>Free gases of spinless fermions moving on a geometric background with lattice symmetries are considered. Their Fermi seas and corresponding boundaries may be classified according to their topological properties at zero temperature. This is accomplished by considering the flat orbifolds $R^{d}/\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$ being the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space. For $d=1$, there are 2 topological classes: a circumference, corresponding to an insulator and an interval, identified as a conductor. For $d=2$, the number of topological classes extends to 17: there are 8 with the topology of a disk identified as conductors and 4 corresponding to a 2-sphere matching insulators, both sets eventually including finite numbers of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The rest of the listing includes single cases corresponding to insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle) and conductors (annulus, Möbius strip). Physical interpretations of the singularities are provided, as well as examples that fit within this listing. Given the topological nature of this classification, its results are expected to be robust against small perturbative interactions.</p>

            <h2>Surface Effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy of IrMn$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robert A. Lawrence, Matt I.J. Probert</p>
            <p>Magnetic anisotropy is a key parameter to describe the exchange bias effect in heterostructures. In this paper, we describe explicit density functional calculations of the magnetic structure of an interface between the industrially critically antiferromagnetic material, IrMn, and Fe, which together form a simple ferromagnet-antiferromagnet heterostructure. Additionally, the magnetic anisotropy was evaluated for several terminations of the IrMn. It was found that the [111] surface had a perpendicular anisotropy of 1.62 meV/$\textÅ^2$, whereas the two possible [100] surfaces (Ir-rich and Mn-rich) had in-plane anisotropies of 0.13 meV/$\textÅ^2$ and 1.39 meV/$\textÅ^2$ respectively. The affect of the magnetic order of the easy and hard configurations were calculated and used to explain the relative values of the anisotropies.</p>

            <h2>Electronic frictional effects near metal surfaces with strong correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunhao Liu, Wenjie Dou</p>
            <p>The electronic friction-Langevin dynamics (EF-LD) offers a simplified framework for describing nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, particularly in electrochemical and molecular electronic applications. We investigate the electronic friction behavior for the Hubbard-Holstein model using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) theory. We show that electron-electron interactions lead to the formation of two energy levels in the impurity, resulting in two peaks in the electronic friction at the resonances of electron attachment or detachment with the metal's Fermi level. We further benchmark our results against mean field theory (MFT) and exact diagonalization (ED). The results calculated by ED and DMRG show strong agreement at high temperatures, suggesting the results from DMRG are reliable; however, at low temperatures, ED exhibits significant deviations relative to DMRG due to the finite-size limitations inherent in ED calculations. MFT completely fails to recover Fermi resonance in electronic friction. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the electronic friction using EF-LD. Simulations reveal differences between the electronic population and kinetic energy dynamics predicted by MFT and DMRG approaches, suggesting that MFT approach is unreliable for nonadiabatic dynamics of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Parametrically Driven Superradiance of an Interacting Tavis-Cummings Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Jie Geng, Yiwen Han, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>We consider the superradiant transition of a generalized Tavis-Cummings model, where a number of two-level qubits are coupled to a dissipative cavity. The cavity is coherently driven through a parametric medium, and all-to-all interactions between the qubits are introduced. While the nonlinear gain from the parametric drive breaks the U(1) symmetry of the standard Tavis-Cummings model, thus giving rise to superradiance with squeezed cavity fields, we show that the interactions impact the collective excitations and significantly modify the superradiant transition. Insights to the superradiant phase transitions, as well as the interaction effects, are obtained through effective models involving only a handful of low-lying collective states, under which the steady-state phase diagram of the hybrid system is faithfully reproduced. Our study is relevant to Rydberg-atom arrays coupled to a parametrically driven cavity, where the long-range interactions derive from the dipole-dipole interatomic interactions.</p>

            <h2>Domain-Wall Mediated Polarization Switching in Ferroelectric AlScN: Strain Relief and Field-Dependent Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Zheng, Charles Paillard, Dawei Wang, Peng Chen, Hong Jian Zhao, Yu Xie, Laurent Bellaiche</p>
            <p>Aluminum nitride is a traditional wide-bandgap semiconductor that has been widely used in high-power electronic and optoelectronic devices. Recently, scandium-doped aluminum nitride (AlScN) was shown to host ferroelectricity with high remnant polarization and excellent thermal stability. However, its practical use is currently limited by its high coercive field, $E_c$. Understanding the atomic-scale switching mechanism is essential to guide strategies for reducing $E_c$. Here, we combine density functional theory and machine-learning molecular dynamics to investigate polarization switching mechanisms in AlScN over various Sc concentrations and applied electric fields. We find that collective switching induces excessive lattice strain and is therefore unlikely to occur. Rather, pre-existing domain walls relieve strain and lead to a distinct switching dynamics, with the associated switching mechanism being field dependent. More precisely, at low electric fields, switching proceeds via gradual domain-wall propagation, well described by the Kolmogorov-Avram-Ishibashi model; meanwhile high fields trigger additional nucleation events, producing rapid and more homogeneous reversal, whose mixed switching process is better described by the simultaneous non-linear nucleation and growth model. These findings highlight the critical role of domain-wall dynamics in nitride ferroelectrics and suggest that domain engineering provides a viable route to control coercive fields and enhance device performance.</p>

            <h2>Edge states, pairing, and sorting of motile chiral particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raushan Kant, Ananyo Maitra, A K Sood, Sriram Ramaswamy</p>
            <p>We present experiments on chiral active polar particles, realized as vibrated granular rods, revealing the formation of robust ``skipping orbits'' at hard boundaries. These edge states exhibit a net circulation opposite to the particles' intrinsic rotation and lead to a pronounced accumulation at the boundary, stronger than for their achiral counterparts. The directed nature of these orbits provides a simple yet high-fidelity mechanism for chiral sorting -- even for solitary particles, unlike in T Barois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 , 238003 (2020). We propose a unified theoretical framework for boundary interactions of both chiral and achiral particles. In this model, an effective outward radial force, proportional to motility and chirality, explains the observed boundary-hugging. Our theory predicts, and our experiments confirm, a transition in the pairing of two particles of the same chirality, from apolar spinners to polar circle walkers, with increasing packing fraction of an ambient medium of beads.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Caravelli, Gianluca Milano, Adam Z. Stieg, Carlo Ricciardi, Simon Anthony Brown, Zdenka Kuncic</p>
            <p>Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable, self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks (SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems, dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex systems, and self-organising principles offers a unique opportunity to advance a new generation of physical intelligence technologies.</p>

            <h2>Integration of promising piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties in Janus In$XY$ ($X$ = S, Se, Te; $Y$ = Cl, Br, I) monolayers and their heterojunctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyue Liu, Ziqiang Li, Yanfeng Ge, Yong Liu, Xing Wang, Wenhui Wan</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials show great promise as piezoelectric materials and photocatalysts for water splitting. In this work, we systematically investigated the piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties of the hexagonal Janus InXY (X = S, Se, Te; Y = Cl, Br, I) monolayers (MLs) using first-principles calculations. Except for InSeCl ML, the remaining eight InXY MLs are stable and exhibit exceptionally high in-plane piezoelectric coefficients ($|d_{22}| = $6.07--155.27 pm/V), which exceed those of most known 2D materials. InXY MLs possess band edges straddling the water redox potentials at pH = 0. Their intrinsic vertical polarization induces an intralayer polarization field $E_{\rm intra}$, leading to low exciton binding energies (0.44--0.78 eV). Moreover, their strong vertical piezoelectric responses ($|d_{32}|$ = 0.34--0.65 pm/V) suggest that in-plane stress can further enhance $E_{\rm intra}$ to facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, these InXY MLs exhibit high electron mobility (101--899 cm$^2$/V/s) and a pronounced anisotropy ratio in carrier mobility, which effectively suppresses charge recombination. To optimize performance, we constructed a van der Waals heterojunction (InSI/InSeBr), which demonstrates remarkable photocatalytic properties, including enhanced redox ability, a direct Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, strong visible-light absorption, high carrier mobility, and excellent photocorrosion resistance. Our results indicate that hexagonal Janus InXY MLs and their heterojunctions are multifunctional materials integrating piezoelectricity and photocatalysis, paving the way for energy conversion applications.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) composed of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and layered magnetic semiconductors offer great opportunities to manipulate exciton and valley properties of TMDs. Here, we present magneto-photoluminescence (PL) studies in a WSe2 monolayer (ML) on a CrSBr crystal, an anisotropic layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Our results reveal unique behavior of each of the ML-WSe2 PL peaks under magnetic field that is distinct from the pristine case. An intriguing feature is the clear enhancement of the PL intensity that we observe each time the external magnetic field tunes the energy of an exciton in CrSBr into resonance with one of the optical states of WSe2. This result suggests a magnetic field-controlled resonant energy transfer (RET) beyond other effects reported in similar structures. Our work provides deep insight on the importance of different mechanisms into magnetic vdWHs and underscores its great potential for light harvesting and emission enhancement of two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Topological magnons, quantized spin waves featuring nontrivial boundary modes, present a promising route toward lossless information processing. Realizing practical devices typically requires magnons excited in a controlled manner to enable precise manipulation of their topological phases and transport behaviors. However, their inherent charge neutrality and a high frequency nature pose a significant challenge for nonvolatile control, especially via electric means. Herein, we propose a general strategy for electrical control of topological magnons in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators. With strong spin-layer coupling, an applied vertical electric field induces an interlayer potential imbalance that modifies intralayer Heisenberg exchanges between adjacent layers. This electric-field-driven modulation competes with the bilayer's intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, enabling the accurate tuning of the band topology and nonreciprocal dynamics of magnons. More importantly, such an electric control mechanism exhibits strong coupling with external magnetic fields, unveiling new perspectives on magnetoelectric coupling in charge-neutral quasiparticles</p>

            <p>In this study, we reveal nontrivial quantum physics in an infinite-temperature system. By performing an unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we study a hybrid model composed of hard-core bosons, whose hopping amplitude is mediated by the density of another type of soft-core bond bosons that can absorb entropy indefinitely. It is shown that the Bose-Einstein condensate can persist in three dimensions even when the temperature approaches the infinite-temperature limit. In contrast, in two dimensions, the quasi-superfluid is depleted by the fluctuations of the bond bosons, which, on the other hand, enhance the conductivity of the hard-core bosons in the normal phase. A generalization to the fermionic model has also been discussed.</p>

            <p>Non-reciprocal devices are key components in both classical and quantum electronics. One approach to realizing passive non-reciprocal microwave devices is through capacitive coupling between external electrodes and materials exhibiting non-reciprocal conductance. In this work, we develop an analytic framework that captures the response of such devices in the presence of dissipation while accounting for the full AC dynamics of the material. Our results yield an effective circuit model that accurately describes the device response in experimentally relevant regimes even at small dissipation levels. Furthermore, our analysis reveals counterpropagating features arising from the intrinsic AC response of the material that could be exploited to dynamically switch the non-reciprocity of the device, opening pathways for tunable non-reciprocal microwave technologies.</p>

            <p>The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moiré superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moiré-pocket to intra-moiré-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moiré exciton and a stabilization of moiré trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moiré pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moiré trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.</p>

We introduce auxiliary functions, constructed by extending hydrogen-like wave functions through a modification of the Legendre function.

By aligning $|\psi|^2$ with the symmetry of the crystal field, they allow rapid determination of eigenstate structures without the need for elaborate calculations. The agreement with established results indicates that these functions capture the essential physics while offering considerable computational simplification.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in thin films of the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La327) under compressive strain has generated enormous interest, opening up further opportunities to stabilize superconductivity in this class of materials at ambient pressure. To better understand the many-body normal state from which superconductivity arises, it is important to ascertain the nature and role of correlations in its electronic structure. To provide insights into this question, we use a fully charge self-consistent DFT+e-DMFT (eDMFT) approach to study La327 at several compressive strain levels. At the strain level where superconductivity has been observed experimentally (-2\%), in contrast with DFT and DFT+$U$ results, the so-called $\gamma$ pocket emerges and the associated band, of mostly $d_{z^2}$ character, crosses the Fermi level exhibiting `flat band''-like features when dynamical correlations are included. Larger strain levels suppress the $\gamma$ pocket, which may have implications for superconductivity or its pairing symmetry.</p>

            <p>Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure, which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.</p>

This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed.

            <p>Deorbitalization of a conventional meta-generalized-gradient exchange-correlation approximation replaces its dependence upon the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density with a dependence on the density gradient and Laplacian. In principle, that simplification should provide improved computational performance relative to the original meta-GGA form because of the shift from an orbital-dependent generalized Kohn-Sham potential to a true KS local potential. Often that prospective gain is lost because of problematic roughness in the density caused by the density Laplacian and consequent roughness in the exchange-correlation potential from the resulting higher-order spatial derivatives of the density in it. We address the problem by constructing a deorbitalizer based on the RPP deorbitalizer [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 083803 (2022)] with comparative smoothness of the potential along with retention of constraint satisfaction as design goals. Applied to the r^2SCAN exchange-correlation functional [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208 (2020)], we find substantial timing improvements for solid-state calculations over both r^2SCAN and its earlier deorbitalization for high precision calculations of structural properties, while improving upon the accuracy of RPP deorbitalization for both solids and molecules.</p>

            <p>Boltzmann transport calculations based on band structures computed from first principles play an important role in modern thermoelectric materials research. Among available codes, the \textsc{BoltzTraP} code is the most widely adopted, but many recent studies contain systematic mistakes. We identify three error modes: (1) inserting the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric field, $\kappa_0$, in place of the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric current, $\kappa_e$, (2) computing the figure of merit $zT$ by combining a constant relaxation time of unity while keeping the lattice thermal conductivity $\kappa_\ell$ in standard units, and (3) doing both errors at once. We have found many examples of the third error, but since the first two are simpler, we suspect they are also present in the literature. For the single parabolic band model, we derive exact analytical limits in the non-degenerate and near-degenerate regimes, and we show how mistakes appear for the realistic case study of ZrNiSn. Our results illustrate how faulty calculations can appear reasonable at certain temperatures and Fermi levels, and we provide practical guidance for identifying faulty results and avoiding such pitfalls in thermoelectric transport studies.</p>

Here, we calculate the current in such junctions using a Lindblad formalism within the Markovian approximation. We consider transport in the Coulomb blockade regime with spin-polarized leads and a magnetic field smaller than the coercive field of either lead. Dependences on magnetic field and lead spin polarization of the spin blockade, decoherence, and spin lifetime of the subsystems of this model are calculated.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Rotational Order and Re-entrant Global Order of Vicsek Agents in a Complex Noise Environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohd Yasir Khan</p>
            <p>Noisy pursuit in complex environments drives emergent collective behaviors in active matter systems. A compelling platform to study the impact of environment cues is provided by the standard Vicsek model for studying flocking and swarming phenomena. In this study, we explore the collective dynamics of Vicsek agents in a complex noise environment, featuring a noiseless circular region ($\eta_{\text{c}} = 0.0$) surrounded by a noisy outer region ($\eta_{\text{b}} = 1.0$, tunable), with a mutually repelling interactions. By varying the outer noise intensity, we observe an emergent rotational order ($\phi_r$) that peaks at higher noise levels ($\eta_{\text{b}}\sim 1$), as revealed by phase and susceptibility plots. Global order follows ($\phi$) follows a `U' shaped curve, $\phi \sim 0.965$ at $\eta_b=0$, dies down to $\phi \sim 0.57$ at $\eta_b=0.9$ and re-enters at $\eta_b > 1$ and peaks $\phi \sim 0.960$ at $\eta_b=1.5$. The latter rise attributing to $\phi_r$ increase. Higher particle velocities enhance escape rates ($\kappa$) from the circular region, with slower-moving agents exhibiting greater virtual confinement. We quantify escape dynamics through time-averaged and first-passage escape rates, demonstrating velocity-dependent retention on the probability of finding the bi-motility agent flocks at a give time resulting in segregation and trapping. Introducing a gradual noise increase from the circle's center to the outer region reduces both global ($\phi$) and rotational ($\phi_r$) order, underscoring the impact of environmental heterogeneity and sudden annealing over gradual change.

            <p>Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy-efficient and climate-friendly alternative to traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials were minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit-cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. Our approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.</p>

            <h2>Luminescence-Induced Tunable Superconductivity in BSCCO via GaP Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyu Hai, Duo Chen, Ruiyuan Bi, Yao Qi, Lifeng Xun, Xiaoyan Li, Xiaopeng Zhao</p>
            <p>The enhancement of superconducting properties in high-temperature copper-oxide superconductor B(P)SCCO remains a hot research topic in the field of superconducting materials. Building on previous research, here we introduce GaP quantum dots as an heterophase into the B(P)SCCO superconductor, aiming to enhance its superconductivity through the luminescent properties of GaP quantum dots. The experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of GaP quantum dots into B(P)SCCO generates significant tunable superconducting effects, leading to enhanced critical transition temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), and Meissner field (Hc) of B(P)SCCO with increasing luminescent intensity of the GaP quantum dots. The enhancement effect induced by GaP quantum dots exhibits a positive correlation with luminescent intensity, meaning samples with the addition of GaP quantum dots exhibiting higher luminescent intensity show elevated Tc, Jc, and Hc values. Unlike impurity effects, a distinct critical concentration dependency is observed. Notably, this GaP quantum dot modification strategy is not only effective in conventional superconductors but also applicable to high-temperature oxide superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Topological characterization of phase transitions and critical edge states in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Rujia Jing, Shenlin Wu</p>
            <p>Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</p>

            <p>The effective diffusion of Brownian particles in periodic potential has been a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physcis. A classical result is the Lifson formula which provides the effective diffusion constant in periodic potentials. Extending beyong periodicity, our recent work [arXiv:2504.16527] has demonstrated that a modified Lifson expression remains valid for Brownian motion in quasi-periodic potentials. In this work, we extend our previous results by incorporating spatial quasi-periodic noise and examining different stochastic interpretations, $\alpha\in[0,1]$. The proposed framework is simple, computationally efficient, and unifies the treatment of diffusion in both periodic and quasi-periodic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bastian Schindler, Renan da Silva Souza, Walter Hofstetter</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with local onsite disorder, where the competition between disorder and short-range interactions leads to the emergence of a Bose glass (BG) phase between the Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid (SF) phases. In order to analyze the inhomogeneous system we employ real-space bosonic dynamical mean-field theory and perform an ensemble average over disorder realizations. To distinguish the MI from the BG phase, we compare the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the compressibility with the energy gap condition. To identify the insulator to SF transition, we apply a percolation analysis to the condensate order parameter. In qualitative accordance with the theorem of inclusions we always find an intermediate BG phase between the SF and MI. However, the quantitative comparison indicates significant deviations between the MI to BG phase boundary expected in the thermodynamic limit and the one obtained for a finite system size. Analyzing the spectral function in the strong-coupling regime reveals evidence for analytically predicted damped localized modes in the dispersion relation.</p>

            <h2>Odd-Parity Selection in Parity-Forbidden Electronic Transitions Revealed by Mn4+ Fluorescence Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yitong Wang, Fei Tang, Jiqiang Ning, Shijie Xu</p>
            <p>Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors represent a significant class of narrow band red-emitting materials, whose luminescent properties are profoundly influenced by electron-phonon coupling. However, the parity-forbidden nature of these electronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon approximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the Huang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed electric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding the principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic transitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent intensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly suppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To elucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden systems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment of the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers the physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order sidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is derived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2). This work not only reveals new findings regarding the phonon sidebands of the parity-forbidden electronic transition systems, but also establishes an improved theoretical framework for understanding the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms of color centers in solids.</p>

            <h2>Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baruch Meerson</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n > 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n > 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.</p>

            <p>The Holstein model is a benchmark model of systems with electron-phonon interaction. However, its electrical transport properties are not yet fully understood. In this work, we performed numerically exact calculations of imaginary-time current-current correlation function of the Holstein Hamiltonian for a broad range of model parameters. These calculations were performed using a path-integral based Quantum Monte Carlo method. We compared these results with the results obtained under the assumption of conventional band transport, small polaron hopping and polaron band transport. From this comparison we identified the regions in parameter space where each of these transport regimes is valid. In some cases when imaginary-time comparison of current-current correlation functions could not give conclusive results, we complemented them with real-time comparisons or the comparison with literature data on numerically exact dc mobilities. Overall, we found that the parameter space is almost completely covered by the three mentioned transport regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanju Park (Swansea University), Biagio Lucini (Queen Mary University of London), Gert Aarts (Swansea University)</p>
            <p>Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.</p>

            <p>Understanding how red blood cell (RBC) suspensions navigate porous materials is critical for for both fundamental physiology, such as maternal-fetal exchange in the placenta, and transformative biomedical applications, including rapid, low-cost disease diagnostics from a single drop of blood in resource-constrained settings. Here we elucidate how RBC movement through fibrous microporous structures is influenced by cell aggregation agents, emphasizing the impact of their clustering, membrane flexibility, and confinement. By varying the volume fraction of the RBC (hematocrit) and aggregation strength, we reveal a surprising phase separation: a dense RBC core surrounded by a cell-free layer, an effect not previously reported in whole blood studies. This separation is shown to be more pronounced with rigidified cells and persists even at high hematocrit levels, unlike in healthy samples. By connecting RBC deformability and aggregability to pore-mediated phase dynamics, our study provides a foundation for new diagnostic tools capable of classifying blood disorders or evaluating blood quality using only a sheet of structured paper, seamlessly integrating fundamental fluid mechanics with translational biomedical innovation in a previously unexplored manner.</p>

NbTi, a superconducting alloy with a high upper critical field, enables SCPW resonators resilient to such conditions.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Jinsheng Liu, Tyler C. Sterling, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit exceptional dielectric and electromechanical properties, yet their microscopic origins remain elusive due to the interplay of hierarchical polar structures and chemical complexity. While models based on polar nanoregions or nanodomains offer valuable phenomenological insights, they often lack the first-principles predictive capability necessary for quantitatively describing functional properties such as piezoelectric coefficients. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, enabled by a universal first-principles-based machine-learning interatomic potential, to investigate atomic-scale polar dynamics in canonical Pb-, Bi-, and Ba-based relaxors. Across all systems, we uncover a universal dipolar nematic state, characterized by long-range orientational order of local polarizations without local alignment, challenging conventional polar cluster-based paradigms. We introduce a universal order parameter, derived from the skewness of the distributions of the local polarization autocorrelation functions, that captures the thermal evolution of both lead-based and lead-free systems within a single master curve. This nematic order, and its robust structural memory under electric field cycling, underpins key relaxor phenomena, including diffuse phase transition, frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion, and reversible giant piezoelectricity. Our findings establish a unified microscopic framework for relaxors and present a broadly applicable statistical approach to understanding complex disordered materials.</p>

            <p>Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome lattice has been extensively studied and the snub square lattice has served as a quasicrystal approximant, the broader family remains comparatively unexplored in the context of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, incorporating both $s$ and $p$ orbitals. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and they give rise to sizable spin Hall currents.</p>

These non-pertubative features can be theoretically accessed and studied in a controlled way in all dimensions using the functional renormalisation group. We propose an overview of the related results, which provide the full picture of the fixed-point structure and associated scaling regimes of the KPZ equation in $d=1$ and in higher dimensions.</p>

Our results show that the polarized phonons within the sample substrate induce robust, helicity-defined magnetization reversal in the magnetic overlayer. Moreover, the quality of switching remains largely unaffected when the degree of ellipticity of the infrared excitation is varied at frequencies resonant with the targeted phonon modes. Conversely, as the excitation is moved slightly off-resonance, switching quality becomes highly sensitive to the ellipticity of the incident light.</p>

            <p>The realization of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in cold atomic gases is a long-standing goal in quantum simulation. Established approaches, including rapidly rotating gases and tight-binding lattices, are often hampered by low interaction energies and small many-body energy gaps. While optical flux lattices (OFLs) can achieve higher effective magnetic flux densities, standard two-state configurations generate highly non-uniform fields, and extensions to multi-state systems introduce significant experimental complexity. Here, we present a new paradigm for engineering robust FQH phases in OFLs using only two internal atomic states. We show that the introduction of an additional scalar potential provides a generic mechanism for creating Chern bands that are simultaneously essentially flat and "ideal." Drawing on concepts from moiré materials, these desirable properties arise by tuning lattice parameters to certain $N$-flat manifolds $(N=1,2,\dots)$, where the $1$-flat manifold shares its origin with certain "magic-angle" conditions. We provide a variety of examples of how to design optical flux lattices, including dark-state OFLs, to achieve these goals. This method allows for precise tuning of band flatness and stabilizes both Abelian and non-Abelian FQH phases. Our scheme is compatible with existing experimental capabilities using vector polarizability, opening practical routes to exploring strongly correlated topological physics with cold atoms.</p>

            <p>Realizing exotic Hamiltonians beyond the Ising model is a key pursuit in experimental statistical physics. One such example is the Blume-Capel model, a three-state spin model, whose phase diagram features a tricritical point where second-order and first-order transition lines converge, leading to a coexistence of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases. Here, we realize an artificial crystal of single-domain nanomagnets, placed on the links of the Ruby lattice, enabling real-space observation of the Blume-Capel degrees of freedom. These Blume-Capel degrees of freedom are represented by the presence, sign and interactions of the toroidal moments that emerge naturally in plaquettes of nanomagnets in the Ruby artificial spin ice. By precisely tuning the lattice parameters of the Ruby artificial spin ice, we demonstrate control over the two-step ordering process of the toroidal moments, whereby there is a high-temperature crossover from a paramagnetic phase to an intermediate paratoroidic regime, followed by a second-order phase transition to a ferrotoroidic ground state. This sequence of toroidal phases and transitions is accurately captured by the Blume-Capel framework and provides a direct realization of a substantial portion of the phase diagram associated with the model. This establishes a new platform for exploring exotic Hamiltonians in terms of artificial spin ice superstructures, here with groups of nanomagnets forming toroidal moments. The success of this mapping paves the way for an entirely new frontier in artificial spin ice: intentionally engineering lattice designs whose effective Hamiltonians mediate unconventional forms of magnetic order, with new behaviors and functionalities.</p>

We find that an extensile active fluid preferentially accumulates at a boundary if the anchoring is planar, whereas its boundary concentration decreases for homeotropic anchoring. These tendencies are reversed if the active fluid is contractile. We argue that the sorting results from gradients in the nematic order, and show that the behaviour can be driven by either imposed boundary anchoring or spontaneous anchoring induced by active flows. Our results can be tested by experiments on microtubule-kinesin motor networks, and may be relevant to sorting to the boundary in cell colonies or cancer spheroids.</p>

We first show that the operator Loschmidt echo in noisy unitary dynamics is equivalent to the operator norm of the corresponding dissipative dynamics upon noise averaging. We then analyze this quantity in two complementary ways, revealing universal dynamical behavior. First, we develop a heuristic picture for generic Floquet systems that connects Loschmidt echoes, out-of-time-order correlators, and operator growth, which is valid at any dissipation strength. We assert that the Loschmidt echo has two dynamical regimes depending on the time $t$ and the strength of the noise $p$: Gaussian decay for $pt\ll1$ and exponential decay (with a noise-independent decay rate) for $pt\gg1$. Lastly, we rigorously prove all our results for a solvable chaotic many-body quantum circuit, the dissipative random phase model -- thus providing exact insight into dissipative quantum chaos.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tapas Bar, Anurag Banerjee, Blai Casals, Gustau Catalan, Javier Rodríguez-Viejo</p>
            <p>The early prediction of tipping points, distinguished by sudden and catastrophic shifts from stable states, poses a challenging task that would enable us to assess the impending threat across natural and engineered systems. This threat becomes particularly acute in low-fluctuation environments, where tipping occurs through saddle-node bifurcation without prior warning in noise dynamics. In this study, we investigate the tipping point dynamics of avalanche catastrophes in low-fluctuation domain, employing model system like the zero temperature random field Ising model and thermally deposited cobalt films. As the system approaches the tipping point, avalanche activity reveals pronounced critical behaviour, including critical slowing down, variance enhancement, and a growing spatial correlation length--hallmarks that may serve as early warning signals of impending collapse. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing disorder in the system reduces its vulnerability to catastrophic failure. In highly disorder regimes, these early warning signals emerge well before the transition, thereby providing a large margin for anticipation and mitigation. This key finding suggests a protective role of disorder offering a novel perspective on resilience in complex systems. Our results not only deepen the understanding of tipping phenomena in disorder materials but also have broader implications for forecasting regime shift in diverse real-world systems.</p>

            <h2>Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Parez, Vincenzo Alba</p>
            <p>We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</p>

            <h2>Embodying computation in nonlinear perturbative metamaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sima Zahedi Fard, Paolo Tiso, Parisa Omidvar, Marc Serra-Garcia</p>
            <p>Designing metamaterials that carry out advanced computations poses a significant challenge. A powerful design strategy splits the problem into two steps: First, encoding the desired functionality in a discrete or tight-binding model, and second, identifying a metamaterial geometry that conforms to the model. Applying this approach to information-processing tasks requires accurately mapping nonlinearity -- an essential element for computation -- from discrete models to geometries. Here we formulate this mapping through a nonlinear coordinate transformation that accurately connects tight-binding degrees of freedom to metamaterial excitations in the nonlinear regime. This transformation allows us to design information-processing metamaterials across the broad range of computations that can be expressed as tight-binding models, a capability we showcase with three examples based on three different computing paradigms: a coherent Ising machine that approximates combinatorial optimization problems through energy minimization, a mechanical racetrack memory exemplifying in-memory computing, and a speech classification metamaterial based on analog neuromorphic computing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naman Khandelwal, Nidhi Verma, Pooja Jamdagni, Ashok Kumar</p>
            <p>Over the last decade, researchers have been working to improve a crucial aspect of quantum computing to predict Hamiltonian energy of solids. Quantum algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) have been used to study the molecular systems. However, there is growing interest in adapting and applying these methods to periodic solid-state materials. In this work, we have integrated first-principles density functional theory with VQE and VQD algorithms and utilizing the Wannier Tight-Binding Hamiltonian (WTBH) method to predict the electronic characteristics of solids. We demonstrate that VQE and VQD algorithms can be used to accurately predict electronic characteristics in a variety of multi-component prototype solid-state materials such as-Silicon (semiconductor), Gold (metallic), Boron Nitrile (insulator), Graphene (semi-metal). Efficient SU2 performs well among all the predefined ansatz used in the study. COBYLA is the fastest optimizer among the classical optimizers with minimum number of iterations for convergence. Results of noise models help to understand the band structure when calculated on real quantum hardware. As quantum hardware advances, our method stands as a prototype for future quantum simulations of materials pushing us closer to autonomous quantum discovery engines.</p>

            <h2>Racetrack computing with a topological boundary ratchet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parisa Omidvar, Markus Bestler, Sima Zahedi Fard, Oded Zilberberg, Marc Serra-Garcia</p>
            <p>Multistable order parameters provide a natural means of encoding non-volatile information in spatial domains, a concept that forms the foundation of magnetic memory devices. However, this stability inherently conflicts with the need to move information around the device for processing and readout. While in magnetic systems, domains can be transported using currents or external fields, mechanisms to robustly shuttle information-bearing domains across neutral systems are scarce. Here, we experimentally realize a topological boundary ratchet in an elastic metamaterial, where digital information is encoded in buckling domains and transported in a quantized manner via cyclic loading. The transport is topological in origin: neighboring domains act as different topological pumps for their Bogoliubov excitations, so their interface hosts topological boundary modes. Cyclic loading renders these modes unstable through inter-domain pressure, which in turn drives the motion of the domain wall. We demonstrate that the direction of information propagation can be controlled through adjustable mechanical constraints on the buckling beams, and numerically investigate buckling-based domain-wall logic circuits in an elastic metamaterial network. The underlying tight-binding structure with low-order nonlinearities makes this approach a general pathway toward racetrack memories in neutral systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J.M. Nieto-Villar, R. Mansilla, I. Santamaria-Holek</p>
            <p>A generalization of the entropy production rate is proposed $\Pi_q$ in non-equilibrium systems by extending the formalism of classical stochastic thermodynamics to regimes with non-Gaussian fluctuations. Through the Rényi entropy $S_q$ , where entropic parameter $q$ modulates critical fluctuations, it is defined $\Pi_q$ and the postulated generalized $q$-affinity ${\cal A}_q$ for Markov processes, where it is demonstrated that $\Pi_q \geq 0$, generalizing the second thermodynamics this http URL derived formal framework was applied to the Rössler model, a nonlinear dynamical system exhibiting chaos. Numerical simulations show that the entropy production rate $\Pi_q$ can be used as an index of robustness and complexity by quantitatively corroborating the greater robustness of funnel-type chaos compared to spiral-type chaos. Our results reveal limitations of Gibbs-Shannon entropy in capturing non-Gaussian fluctuations induced by nonlinearity. On the contrary, it is found that $\Pi_q$ it can be a suitable magnitude to measure the intensity of chaotic dynamics through the entropy parameter $q$ , indicating a plausible link with Lyapunov exponents. The proposed formal framework extends the scope of stochastic thermodynamics to complex systems, integrating chaotic dynamics and the role of the entropic index q as a source of irreversibility and in capturing non-Gaussian contributions to entropy production.</p>

            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts, raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal, monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE. This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived photoresponses.</p>

            <p>X-ray scattering at the carbon absorption edge is uniquely sensitive to local molecular bond identity and orientation in organic nanostructures, encoded as a function of photon energy and polarization. However, quantitative analysis is precluded due to the lack of accurate optical models with bond and orientation specificity.

The resulting optical tensor is shown to reproduce data from samples with domains of different orientation and crystalline packing, enabling label-free orientation analyses of individual chemical moieties within molecular nanostructures using resonant X-rays.</p>

            <p>Polar topological textures like the bubble domains, flux--closures, and labyrinth etc., unlock functional responses in ferroic systems but are difficult to stabilize and control in chemically simple, solution--grown materials. Here we show that ultra--thin, large--area CsPbBr$_3$ nanoplatelets host room--temperature ferroelectric bubble domains whose characteristic size is tunable by thickness. Using contact--resonance piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) across 125ñm--2\~$\mu$m, we observe a systematic decrease in domain size with decreasing thickness, consistent with a depolarization--field controlled stability window. Repeated scanning transforms bubbles into labyrinthine patterns, indicating metastability under weak mechanical/electrical perturbations. Upon heating, bubbles evolve into labyrinths and vanish at $T_C\!\approx\!90^\circ$C, with domain nucleation recovered on cooling. These results establish a controllable platform for polar topology in a stable, stochiometric perovskite grown via a solvothermal route, and clarify how electrical boundary conditions (set by thickness and temperature) govern texture selection. The thickness--tunable polar textures identified here offer a route to engineer domain--wall--mediated functionalities in halide perovskites.</p>

            <p>Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes present challenges in monitoring and controlling material properties and process parameters, affecting production quality and defect detection. Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution for addressing these challenges. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework, AM-DefectNet, for benchmarking ML models in melt pool characterization, a critical aspect of AM. We evaluate 15 ML models across 10 metrics using 1514 training and 505 test datasets. Our benchmarking reveals that non-linear tree-based algorithms, particularly CatBoost, LGBM, and XGBoost, outperform other models, achieving accuracies of 92.47%, 91.08%, and 90.89%, respectively. Notably, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) also demonstrates competitive performance with an accuracy of 88.55%. CatBoost emerges as the top-performing algorithm, exhibiting superior performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy for defect classification tasks. Learning curves provide insights into model performance and data requirements, indicating potential areas for improvement.

Our evaluations, conducted on datasets enriched with features derived from powder addition and electrode vibration, reveal XGBoost superior accuracy, followed by AdaBoost, DNN, and ElasticNet. Furthermore, through the integration of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, UNSGA-III, and C-TAEA, we explore and optimize the Pareto front to attain optimal solutions.

            <h2>Hidden orders in spin-orbit entangled correlated insulators</h2>

            <p>In many materials, ordered phases and their order parameters are easily characterized by standard experimental methods. "Hidden order" refers to a phase transition in which an ordered state emerges without such an easily detectable order parameter, despite clear thermodynamic evidence of the transition. The underlying mechanisms for these unconventional states of matter stem from spin-orbit coupling, which intertwines inter-site exchange, classical electron-magnetic interactions, and electron-lattice effects. This physics is elusive to experimental probes and beyond traditional theories of insulating magnetism, requiring sophisticated methodologies for its exploration. In this Review, we survey exotic hidden-order phases in correlated insulators, particularly focusing on the latest progress in material-specific theories and numerical approaches. The relevant degrees of freedom in these phases are local high-rank multipole moments of magnetic and charge density that emerge from spin-orbit entangled correlated shells of heavy d and f electron ions and interact on the lattice via various mechanisms. We discuss approaches to modelling hidden orders in realistic systems via direct ab initio calculations or by constructing low-energy many-body effective Hamiltonian. We also describe how these new theoretical tools have helped to uncover driving mechanisms for recently discovered multipolar phases in double perovskites of heavy transition metals, and how they have proved instrumental in disentangling the role of various interactions in "traditional" f-electron multipolar materials like actinide dioxides. In both cases, material-specific theories have played a key role in interpreting and predicting experimental signatures of hidden orders.</p>

            <p>In this work, we propose two models of coupled harmonic oscillators under Brownian motion to computationally study the applications of fluctuation theorems. This paper also illustrates how to analytically calculate free energy differences for these systems. The computational results clearly show that Crooks relation is able to predict free energy differences between initial and final canonical ensembles with around $1\%$ accuracy by using probability distributions of cumulative work done during nonequilibrium protocols carried out with velocities up to three orders of magnitude larger than the quasi-stationary evolution velocity. The curves of instantaneous force and cumulative work for the second model resemble those obtained experimentally on the unfolding of ARN molecules. Hence, the proposed systems are not just useful to illustrate the performance and conceptual significance of the fluctuation theorems, but also they could be studied as simplified models for biophysical systems.</p>

            <h2>Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paulina R. Martí n-Cornejo, Denis Boyer</p>
            <p>Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.</p>

            <p>Magnetic topological insulators host exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and quantized magnetoelectric responses, but dynamic electrical control of their topological phases remains elusive. Here we demonstrate from first principles that spin-orbit torque enables direct switching of the topological state in the intrinsic antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. A symmetry-enforced interband (time-reversal even) torque persists inside the bulk gap and deterministically reverses the Néel order and layer-resolved Chern number without free carriers. Upon doping, both interband and intraband torques are amplified, lowering the critical electric field for switching by two orders of magnitude. Together, these results establish two complementary regimes of control, dissipationless in-gap torques without Joule heating and enhanced current-induced torques, providing a robust route to manipulate local Chern numbers, quasi-helical edge states, and topological responses in antiferromagnetic topological insulators.</p>

            <p>Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is the most commonly used method in electrochemistry to characterize electrochemical reactions, usually involving macroscopic electrodes. Here we demonstrate a novel optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection (TIR) illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer (PNP-BV) model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast.

            <p>A cost-effective and robust image-processing pipeline is presented for the detection and characterization of exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) material flakes in optical microscope images, designed to facilitate automation in van der Waals heterostructure assembly. The system combines shallow machine learning (ML)-based material classification with a precision-first flake detection algorithm driven by edge morphology and color discontinuity. Step edges are resolved when supported by optical contrast, while spurious features such as dust and background texture are reliably rejected. Each identified flake is exported in a structured format that includes centroid coordinates, bounding geometries, average RGB color, and estimated optical thickness, enabling seamless integration into automated pick-up and stacking workflows. The pipeline is hardware-light and operates without the need for deep learning models or nanoscale ground-truth labels, making it practical for scalable front-end wafer processing at a hardware cost of under 30,000 USD. In contrast to prior approaches that focus solely on detection accuracy, the proposed system unifies flake segmentation with indexing, filtering, and blueprint-driven stacking, forming a closed-loop workflow from image acquisition to device planning. Its low annotation requirement and flexible implementation enable rapid deployment across diverse 2D material systems and imaging conditions.</p>

            <p>This study systematically investigates the effect of stretching boundary conditions, ranging from conservation of cross-sectional area to conservation of volume, on the rupture behavior of phantom star polymer networks using energy-minimizing coarse-grained molecular simulations. By continuously varying the deformation parameter, the simulations reveal that true stress and rupture characteristics, such as strain and stress at break and work for rupture, systematically decrease as the boundary condition approaches cross-sectional area conservation. In contrast, nominal stress and the corresponding rupture characteristics exhibit near-independence from boundary conditions, indicating that bond tension remains largely unaffected for phantom networks under the examined conditions. These results clarify that volume expansion primarily drives deviations in true stress and highlight a critical distinction between true and nominal stress-strain definitions. The difference between true and nominal stress-strain relations also affected the scaling exponent for strand length dependence on stretch at break. The findings stress the importance of specifying both deformation boundary conditions and stress-strain definitions in polymer network simulations for accurate interpretation of mechanical properties.</p>

The G band exhibits a pronounced blue shift with increasing pressure, indicating enhanced interlayer coupling between graphite planes. In the water-rich region, the librational band and three distinct O-H stretching modes were identified. Notably, above 8 GPa, the slope of the pressure dependence decreases relative to the earlier report, likely due to the influence of the water pressure medium, emphasizing the need for further investigation at higher pressures.</p>

            <p>The recently proposed term "heterostructured (HS) materials" serves as an umbrella classification encompassing a wide range of materials that hold great promise for enhanced mechanical properties. Most HS materials exhibit back-stress strengthening, as is typical for all plastically non-homogeneous materials. To better embody the distinctiveness of materials crafted via innovative heterostructuring, here we introduce the concept of "structural gradient hardening" (SGH), which captures an essential feature of HS materials and complements traditional strengthening mechanisms. SGH refers to the extra strengthening that arises from a characteristic gradient structure introduced by heterostructuring, beyond what is predicted by the rule of mixtures. This distinction is useful, as the overall back stress can in fact be partitioned into Type I and Type II components, with the latter specifically quantifying the extra hardening originating from the structural and strain gradients established by heterostructuring, as articulated in this Viewpoint article.</p>

Insulator-to-metal (IMT) phase transition behavior of VO2 thin films fabricated in a low-O2 environment is characterized with temperature dependent spectral infrared transmittance and electrical resistivity measurements, where there is 15% higher infrared transmittance change and additional 1 order change in resistivity in comparison with VO2 thin films fabricated in a O2-rich environment. Grazing angle X-ray diffraction scan confirms no presence of higher oxides in the VO2 oxidized in low-O2 environment, which improves its quality significantly. Comprehensive studies on thermal annealing and vacuum reduction for tungsten doped VO2 thin films are also carried out to find the optimal fabrication conditions. With the tungsten at. % measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the optimal WVO2 thin films fabricated through this streamlined oxidation, annealing and reduction processes in extremely low-O2 furnace environment exhibit lowered IMT temperature at -23°C per at.% of tungsten dopants from 68°C without doping. This low-cost and scalable fabrication method could facilitate the wide development of tunable WVO2 coatings in thermal and energy applications.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect in the strained bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Li Wu, Jia-Liang Wan, Xiao-Qin Yu</p>
            <p>We theoretically analyze the nonlinear valley Nernst effect (NVNE) as the second-order response of temperature gradient through the semiclassical framework of electron dynamics up to second order. Our study shows that an intrinsic nonlinear pure valley current can be generated vertically to the applied temperature in the materials with both inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This intrinsic NVNE has a quantum origin from the quantum metric and shows independence from the relaxation time. It's found that the local largest symmetry near the valleys for the nonvanishing intrinsic NVNE is a single mirror symmetry in two-dimensional systems. We theoretically investigate the intrinsic NVNE in the uniaxially strained gapless bilayer graphene and find the intrinsic NVNE can emerge when applying the temperature gradient vertically to the direction of strain. Interestingly, a transition from the compressive strain to the tensile one results in the sign reversal of the intrinsic NVNE.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for generalized time-reversal observables</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tetta Indo, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Time-reversal symmetry plays an essential role in the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which bound the fluctuations of observables in terms of the associated dissipation. In fact, thermodynamic uncertainty relations are typically derived under the assumption that the observable of interest is antisymmetric under time reversal. This also suggests that existing thermodynamic uncertainty relations are restricted to a limited class of observables. In this paper, we mitigate this restriction by introducing a new class of observables that do not exhibit the exact antisymmetry but only change the sign under time reversal. We call it generalized time reversal and derive a broadly applicable thermodynamic uncertainty relation for observables with this condition. The generalization is achieved by direct statistical arguments on the probability distributions of dissipation and the observable, and holds for both deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation in a quantum refrigeration model, showing that the precision of generalized observables remains expressible in terms of the heat-dissipation cost. The result extends the scope of thermodynamic uncertainty relations beyond what was reached by frameworks relying on strong symmetries imposed by fluctuation theorems.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial Control of both Magnetism and Polarization in a van der Waals Ferromagnet/Ferroelectric Heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyanshu Raj, Sourav Mal, Rana Saha, Prasenjit Sen</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures provide a promising platform for the simultaneous control of distinct ferroic orders, with potential applications in magnetoelectric devices and spintronics. The practical implementation of such technologies requires 2D magnets with high Curie temperatures and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Here, based on first-principles calculations, we propose a multiferroic heterostructure composed of the room-temperature ferromagnet $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$ and the ferroelectric $\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$. We show that intercalation of Fe atoms into the van der Waals gap of the $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$/$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$ heterostructure enhances PMA by nearly an order of magnitude relative to the pristine $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$ monolayer, while simultaneously allowing electric polarization to be modulated through interfacial charge redistribution. The enhancement of PMA arises from interfacial hybridization that modifies the spin-orbit coupling of Fe $d$-orbitals. Our results demonstrate an effective pathway to engineer magnetoelectric coupling in two-dimensional multiferroic heterostructures and pave the way toward energy-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We report that a dielectric polymer chain, constrained at both ends, sharply collapses when exposed to a high electric field. The chain collapse is driven by nonlocal dipolar interactions and anisotropic polarization of monomers, a characteristic of real polymers that prior theories were unable to incorporate. Once collapsed, a large number of chain monomers accumulate at the center location between the chain ends, locally increasing the electric field and polarization by orders of magnitude. The chain collapse is sensitive to the orientation of the applied electric field and chain stretch. Our findings not only offer new ways for rapid actuation and sensing but also provide a pathway to discover the critical physics behind instabilities and electrical breakdown in dielectric polymers.</p>

            <p>We report on the electronic, magnetic, and magneto-transport properties of Fe-based kagome Dirac system, RFe$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Ho, Dy). Magnetic properties study reveals an antiferromagnetic order with N$\acute{e}$el temperature of $T_N \approx$ 570 K. Additionally, a weak ferromagnetic order emerge at low temperatures. Magnetotransport measurements demonstrate an extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) reaching as high as $3\times 10^{3} \%$ for HoFe$_6$Sn$_6$ and $ 1\times 10^{3} \%$ for DyFe$_6$Sn$_6$ when measured at 2 K with 9 T of magnetic field. The semi-classical two-band model fitting of the Hall conductivity reveals nearly perfect electron-hole compensation and high carrier mobility, which leads to XMR behaviour in these system. Further, we identify large magnetoresistance anisotropy for the magnetic fields applied in different crystallographic orientations. In addition, considerable modification in the angle-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) pattern has been noticed between 2 and 50 K, indicating temperature-dependent changes in the Fermi surface topology of these systems.</p>

            <p>Solid-state lithium batteries possess numerous advantages, such as high energy density, excellent cycle stability, superior mechanical strength, non-flammability, enhanced safety, and extended service life. These characteristics make them highly suitable for applications in aerospace, new energy vehicles, and portable electronic devices. However, the growth of lithium dendrite at the electrode/electrolyte interface remains a critical challenge, limiting both performance and safety. The growth of lithium dendrites in the electrolyte not only reduces the Coulombic efficiency of the battery but also poses a risk of puncturing the electrolyte, leading to internal short circuits between the anode and cathode. This study is to solve the problem of lithium dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries by employing phase-field theory for numerical simulations. A phase-field model is developed by coupling the mechanical stress field, thermal field, and electrochemical field, to investigate the morphology and evolution of lithium dendrites under the condition of different ambient temperatures, external pressures, and their combined effects. The results indicate that higher temperature and greater external pressure significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth, leading to fewer side branches, smoother surfaces, and more uniform electrochemical deposition. Increased external pressure inhibits longitudinal dendrite growth, resulting in a compressed morphology with higher compactness, but at the cost of increased mechanical instability. The combined effect of temperature and pressure exhibits a pronounced inhibitory influence on dendrite growth, with stress concentrating at the dendrite roots. This stress distribution promotes lateral growth, facilitating the formation of flatter and denser lithium deposits.</p>

            <p>We investigate the second order Rényi entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a columnar dimerized square lattice. The universal constant $\gamma$ in the area-law scaling $S_{2}(\ell) = \alpha\ell - \gamma$ is found to be sensitive to the entangling surface configurations, with $\gamma_{\text{sp}} > 0$ for strong-bond-cut (special) surfaces and $\gamma_{\text{ord}} < 0$ for weak-bond-cut (ordinary) surfaces, which is attributed to the distinct conformal boundary conditions. Introducing boundary dimerization drives a renormalization group (RG) flow from the special to the ordinary boundary criticality, and the constant $\gamma$ decreases monotonically with increasing dimerization strength, demonstrating irreversible evolution under the boundary RG flow. These results provide strong numerical evidence for a higher-dimensional analog of the $g$-theorem, and suggest $\gamma$ as a characteristic function for boundary RG flow in (2+1)-dimensional conformal field theory.</p>

            <p>The relaxation modulus of a viscoelastic fluid can be decomposed into multiple Maxwell models and characterized by the relaxation spectrum for the relaxation time. It is empirically known that the logarithmic relaxation time is useful to express the relaxation spectrum. We use information geometry to analyze the relaxation modulus and shown that the logarithmic relaxation time is the most natural variable for the relaxation spectrum. Then we use information theory to estimate the most probable functional form for the relaxation spectrum. We show that the log-normal distribution is the information-theoretically most probable relaxation spectrum. We analyze the properties of the log-normal relaxation spectrum model and compare it with the fractional Maxwell model. The fractional Maxwell model with a small power-law exponent can be approximated as the log-normal relaxation spectrum model with a large standard deviation. We also compare the log-normal relaxation spectrum model with experimental linear viscoelasticity data for a high-density polyethylene, both at melt and solid states.</p>

            <h2>Reentrant superconductivity and superconductor-to-insulator transition in a naturally occurring Josephson junction array tuned by RF power</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Avraham, S. Sankar, S. Sandik, A. Burshtein, M. Goldstein, E. Sela, Y. Dagan</p>
            <p>Superconductivity, characterized by dissipationless current flow with flux expulsion or quantization, is usually muted when the magnetic field or the temperature is sufficiently high. However, in rare instances, superconductivity can reappear upon increasing the temperature or magnetic field, a phenomenon known as reentrant superconductivity. It usually emerges from competing orders in strongly correlated materials. Here we demonstrate reentrant superconductivity as a function of both temperature and magnetic field, tuned by radio frequency (RF) power in a relatively simple system: granular aluminum (grAl), which exhibits the properties of a naturally occurring Josephson junction array. At low temperatures, giant Shapiro steps emerge, exhibiting characteristics of a single Josephson junction. Coherent phase locking across the array's multiple junctions amplifies the quantized voltage, enabling tunability at radio frequencies, as observed in artificially designed Josephson arrays. We show that our system can be tuned from a coherent superconducting (stiff-phase) to an insulating (phase-fluctuating) state using RF power. We propose that the RF power modulates the Josephson coupling energy, $E_J$. Remarkably, at elevated temperatures, the screening of the electron charge suppresses the charging energy, causing superconductivity to reappear. This many-body effect cannot be described within a single junction framework and involves many-body correlations. Our system can therefore be tuned to observe both the single-junction regime and many-body correlation effects, serving as a quantum simulator for complex phenomena in condensed matter physics.</p>

We present selective area growth (SAG) of nanowires, which enable scalability and planar geometries that are compatible with standard semiconductor processing techniques. NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate successfully in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements.</p>

            <p>Quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, in contrast to their periodic counterparts, lack strict periodicity which gives rise to complex and localised spin wave spectra characterized by numerous band gaps and fractal features. Despite their intrinsic structural complexity, quasiperiodic nature of these magnonic crystals enables better tunability of spin wave spectra over their periodic counterparts and therefore holds promise for the applications in reprogrammable magnonic devices. In this article, we provide an overview of magnetization reversal and precessional magnetization dynamics studied so far in various quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, illustrating how their quasiperiodic nature gives rise to tailored band structure, enabling unparalleled control over spin waves. The review is concluded by highlighting the possible potential applications of these quasiperiodic magnonic crystals, exploring potential avenues for future exploration followed by a brief summary.</p>

            <p>Recent progress has enabled the controlled fabrication of domain walls (DWs) in graphene, which host topological kink states. Meanwhile, reliable techniques for constructing graphene-based Joseph- son junctions have been established. While the experimental prerequisites for combining DWs with Josephson junctions are now available, this direction remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate transport properties in graphene-based Josephson junctions mediated by topological kink states and propose three DW engineering strategies. (i) DW number engineering uncovers a continuous evolution of critical current interference pattern from Aharonov-Bohm oscil- lation to Fraunhofer diffraction with increasing DW number, reproducing experimental observations [Barrier et al., Nature 628, 741 (2024)] and suggesting enhanced sensitivity for magnetometry ap- plications. (ii) DW symmetry engineering demonstrates that an asymmetric configuration of DWs under magnetic field yields an ideal Josephson diode characterized by pronounced nonreciprocal transport. (iii) DW geometry engineering reveals that intersecting DWs enable controllable super- current splitting with ratios among leads tunable through the intersection angle, magnetic field, and superconducting phase difference. Our findings elucidate the rich physics of DW-based Josephson junctions and establish a versatile platform for next-generation quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The valley splitting of 2D electrons in doubly-gated silicon-on-insulator quantum wells is studied by low temperature transport measurements under magnetic fields. At the buried thermal-oxide SiO$_{2}$ interface, the valley splitting increases as a function of the electrostatic bias $\delta n = n_{B}-n_{F}$ (where $n_{B}$ and $n_{F}$ are electron densities contributed by back and front gates, respectively) and reaches values as high as $6.3$~meV, independent of the total carrier concentration of the channel. We show that $\delta n$ tunes the square of the wave function modulus at the interface and its penetration into the barrier, both of which are key quantities in a theory describing interface-induced valley splitting, and is therefore the natural experimental parameter to manipulate valleys in 2D silicon systems. At the front interface, made of a thin ``high-k'' dielectric, a smaller valley splitting is observed, adding further options to tune the valley splitting within a single device.</p>

The transverse mode is nearly dispersionless in the long-wavelength limit, while the longitudinal mode, accounting for total charge fluctuations, has a linear dispersion with velocity proportional to two dimensional (2D) electrical polarizability. (2) A gapless phase (Goldstone) mode and a gapped amplitude mode, associated with the fluctuations of EI order parameter, couple to the layer antisymmetric gauge field. In the long-wavelength limit, the Goldstone mode exhibits linear dispersion with velocity inversely proportional to the square root of exciton compressibility, representing the first sound mode of the exciton condensate Significantly, its linear dispersion yields a cubic frequency dependence of the real admittance in microwave impedance microscopy (MIM), providing a method to detect the Goldstone mode directly.</p>

            <p>Although the generic mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity remains notoriously elusive, a set of favorable conditions for its occurrence in a given material has emerged: (i) the electronic structure should have a very high density of states near the Fermi level; (ii) electrons need to be susceptible to a sizable interaction with another degree of freedom to ensure pairing themselves; (iii) the ability to fine-tune some of the system properties significantly helps maximising the critical temperature. Here, by means of high-resolution ARPES, we show that all three criteria are remarkably fulfilled in trigonal platinum bismuthide (t-PtBi$_2$). Specifically, this happens on its surface, which hosts topological surface states known as Fermi arcs.

            <p>Cement paste serves as the universal binder in concrete, formed by mixing water with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). In its fresh state, cement paste is a suspension in which the initial particle inventory continuously dissolves, while simultaneously, a growing population of colloidal calcium silica-hydrate (C-S-H) particles forms and progressively builds a percolated structure that densifies and hardens through hydration. Like most colloidal gels, cement paste is sensitive to external stimuli such as mechanical vibrations and temperature variations. Here, we show that power ultrasound (PUS) applied to OPC paste during the very early stages of hydration significantly alters the mechanical properties of the hardened material. Freshly prepared cement pastes are exposed to PUS at varying durations and intensities before curing for 28 days. Micro-indentation testing at the scale of tens of microns reveals that increasing PUS amplitude and prolonged PUS exposure degrade the micro-mechanical properties of hardened cement paste, making it more ductile. This softening behavior evolves continuously with exposure conditions and is consistent with an increase in porosity, likely caused by micro-cracks induced by PUS. This scenario is further supported by micro-scratch testing, which shows higher levels of acoustic emission in PUS-exposed samples. Finally, nano-indentation confirms that the properties of the individual phases composing the hardened paste -- low-density and high-density C-S-H -- remain largely unaffected. These findings offer valuable experimental insights into novel pathways for modifying the mechanical properties of reactive colloidal gels.</p>

            <p>Lipid vesicles consist of aqueous cores surrounded by a bilayer of phospholipids. Hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles incorporate both polymers and lipids, offering promising properties for developing pharmaceuticals, biosensors, and artificial cells. The hybrid vesicles can be symmetric, in which their two leaflets contain identical compositions, or asymmetric, in which the leaflets possess dissimilar compositions and can lead to dramatically modified properties. However, methods to produce both symmetric and asymmetric hybrid vesicles result in heterogenous compositions and sizes, making it challenging to quantify the effect of asymmetry and limiting applications. Here, we use a microfluidic approach to produce hybrid vesicles containing symmetric or asymmetric leaflets with precisely engineered compositions. We find the vesicles with asymmetric leaflets are significantly stiffer and tougher than those with symmetric leaflets; moreover, the lateral diffusivity of lipids is greatly decreased. The structure for improved toughness consists of an inner leaflet that is a stretchable lipid leaflet and an outer leaflet that is a fully continuous polymer leaflet. This technique of precisely engineering asymmetric structures may be applied to hybrid vesicles composed of block copolymers and phospholipids dissolvable in chloroform and hexane, further expanding their applications.</p>

Out of the entire set, 31 compounds satisfy all criteria for energetic, dynamic, mechanical, and thermal stability. Our analysis reveals several key trends: halide-containing systems exhibit the highest average magnetic moments and the highest magnetic transition temperatures, highlighting their potential for room-temperature spintronic applications. The majority of stable compounds display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), with Fe$_3$SiTe$_2$ exhibiting the strongest PMA among all candidates. Exchange interactions are found to be governed by a dual mechanism, direct exchange between nearest-neighbor Fe atoms and indirect, $p$-orbital-mediated exchange for second-nearest neighbors and beyond. Notably, four compounds have non-centrosymmetric crystal structures and exhibit finite spiralization constants. Among them, Fe$_3$AsBr$_2$ is predicted to host Néel-type skyrmions even at zero external magnetic field, as confirmed by micromagnetic simulations.

The near-edge region is accurately captured using an efficient implementation of time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory applied to core excitations, while ab initio molecular dynamics provides essential sampling of core-excitation energies and interatomic distance distributions for interpreting extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) features. Owing to the efficiency of the approach, the total spectrum can be decomposed into contributions from bulk, defective, and surface environments, which commonly coexist in experimental systems. The methodology is demonstrated for sodium at the Na K-edge in NaCl, where the predicted spectra show good agreement with experimental measurements on thin film samples. This strategy offers a practical route to generating chemically specific XAFS cross-section data for elements and species that remain challenging to characterize experimentally, thereby enabling deeper insights into materials of technological importance.</p>

            <h2>Probing Non-Fermi-Liquid Behaviour of Composite Fermi Liquid via Efficient Thermal Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin-Bin Chen, Hongyu Lu, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>The two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, i.e., the quantum Hall system, is remarkably rich. At half filling of the lowest Landau level, it has been predicted that ``composite fermions'' -- emergent quasiparticle of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta -- can experience zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea, dubbed composite Fermi liquid (CFL). However, the seemingly simple appearance of CFL is a strongly correlated quantum many-body state in disguise, and to solve it in a controlled manner is extremely difficult, to the level that the thermodynamic properties of CFL is still largely unknown. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art thermal tensor network simulations on the $\nu=1/2$ Landau level systems, and observe low-temperature power-law behaviour of the specific heat, signaling the gapless nature of CFL. More importantly, the power is extracted to be closed to $2/3$, clearly deviated from the ordinary linear-$T$ Fermi liquid behaviour, suggesting the coupling between the CFs and the dynamical emergent gauge field and therefore revealed the quantum many-body aspect of the CFL state. Relevance of our methodology to other quantum Hall settings and moiré systems is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Dual Cross-Linked Hydrogels: Linear Rheology and Fractional Calculus Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agniva Dutta, Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Gleb Vasilyev, Eyal Zussman</p>
            <p>Hydrogels are increasingly recognized as a versatile platform for applications spanning from tissue engineering to soft robotics or flexible electronics. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing and tailoring their mechanical performance to meet application-specific demands. However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models.</p>

            <h2>Non-Ferroelectric to Ferroelectric Phase Transition in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ via Rapid Thermal Annealing Induced Nitrogen Doping</h2>

            <p>Oxygen vacancies are often essential for stabilizing the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase in HfO$_2$, with cationic doping widely employed to introduce such defects. In contrast, systematic studies on anionic doping to induce ferroelectricity remain largely in nascent stages. On epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ grown on ITO buffered YSZ substrates that crystallize in a mixed monoclinic (non-polar) and orthorhombic (polar) phases, we introduce nitrogen doping via post deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N$_2$ atmosphere at 900~$^\circ$C. As the annealing time increases from 10s to 4min, the monoclinic phase fraction diminishes, enabling the emergence of well-defined ferroelectric loops in films annealed beyond 2~min. We clearly show that this is an effect of nitrogen incorporation (doping) into the samples through a suite of structure-property correlation measurements including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These results reveal that nitrogen actively participates in the RTA-induced phase stabilization, enabling ferroelectricity in epitaxial Y:HfO$_2$ without sacrificing crystallographic coherence, providing a viable pathway for structure-property correlation studies and a model system to study opto-electronic devices integrated with ferroelectrics.</p>

            <h2>Nanoscale Dipolar Fields in Artificial Spin Ice Probed by Scanning NV Magnetometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ephraim Spindler, Vinayak Shantaram Bhat, Elke Neu, Mathias Weiler, M. Benjamin Jungfleisch</p>
            <p>We investigate dipolar coupling fields in two square-lattice artificial spin ice (ASI) systems with different lattice constants using scanning probe microscopy based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. This technique offers unprecedented spatial resolution, operates under ambient condition, and provides quantitative stray field measurements, making it uniquely suited for studying nanoscale magnetic textures. Our approach combines fluorescence quenching imaging and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cODMR). A comparison of the two ASI samples, which differ in their lattice constants of 1000 nm and 910 nm respectively, reveals differences in the appearance of ice-rule violations - deviations from the lowest energy configuration in ASI vertices. We attribute these variations to varying coupling strengths dictated by the lattice constant. From the cODMR data, we extract both axial and transverse components of the local magnetic field relative to the NV axis. Micromagnetic modeling of these measurements allows for an iterative determination of the external magnetic field orientation, the detection of subtle magnetization tilts induced by weak external fields (well below the nanomagnets' switching threshold), and an estimation of the effective saturation magnetization, thereby accounting for deviations in nanomagnet dimensions. These findings provide crucial insights into the tunable magnetic interactions in ASI, paving the way for the design of advanced magnonic and spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a key tool for characterising nanoscale structures, with functionalised tips now offering detailed images of the atomic structure. In parallel, AFM simulations using the particle probe model provide a cost-effective approach for rapid AFM image generation. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models and substantial simulated datasets, properties such as molecular structure, electrostatic potential, and molecular graph can be predicted from AFM images. However, transferring model performance from simulated to experimental AFM images poses challenges due to the subtle variations in real experimental data compared to the seemingly flawless simulations. In this study, we explore style translation to augment simulated images and improve the predictive performance of machine learning models in surface property analysis. We reduce the style gap between simulated and experimental AFM images and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing structure discovery models through local structural property distribution comparisons. This research presents a novel approach to improving the efficiency of machine learning models in the absence of labelled experimental data.</p>

            <h2>Diamagnetic Meissner response of odd-frequency superconducting pairing from quantum geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankita Bhattacharya, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of quantum geometry in the Meissner response for odd-frequency superconducting pairs in multiband systems. Odd-frequency pairing is traditionally associated with a paramagnetic Meissner response, which raises questions about the stability of the superconducting phase, especially in multiband systems where odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitous. Using analytical calculations in a general two-band, we show that the quantum geometric contribution to the Meissner response from odd-frequency pairs is always diamagnetic for its interband processes, while intraband processes always yield a paramagnetic response. With odd-frequency pairing itself generated by interband pairing, an overall diamagnetic response may often be anticipated. We confirm these results with numerical calculations of models with both flat and dispersive bands. In flat band systems, where geometric effects dominate, the diamagnetic odd-frequency response can even exceed the even-frequency contribution, making odd-frequency pairs the primary source of the diamagnetic Meissner response. In a dispersive two-band system with finite quantum geometry, we similarly find a robust diamagnetic contribution from odd-frequency pairing, even when the total response turns paramagnetic due to even-frequency contributions. These results establish that quantum geometry stabilizes odd-frequency superconductivity and also identify flat-band materials as candidates for realizing odd-frequency superconductivity with a diamagnetic Meissner effect.</p>

            <p>The combination of localized magnetic moments, their frustration and interaction with itinerant electrons is a key challenge of condensed matter physics. Frustrated magnetic interactions promote degenerate ground states with enhanced fluctuations, a topic that is predominantly studied in magnetic insulators. The coupling between itinerant and localized electrons in metals add complexity to the problem, and presently formulated only for extreme cases in which the itinerant electrons mediate exchange between localized spins (RKKY interaction) or suppress the formation of magnetic moments (Kondo screening). Here, we report an in-depth experimental study of the distorted Kagome metal YbAgGe, unravelling the open questions of how frustration, localized magnetism and itinerant electrons are intertwined in frustrated Kondo metals. We find that coupled itinerant and localized electrons give rise to dynamic magnetic correlations below T* ~ 20 K. At lower temperature, frustrated magnetic interactions establish anisotropic magnetic short-range correlations that culminate into antiferromagnetic long-range order below TN = 0.68 K with a significantly reduced modulated magnetic moment. We show that local moment Hamiltonians can yield limited understanding of the microscopic behaviour in frustrated metals, and prompt the extension of more sophisticated model Hamiltonians incorporating itinerant effects.</p>

            <p>Atomically thin metallic chains serve as pivotal systems for studying quantum transport, with their conductance strongly linked to the orbital picture. Here, we report a non-monotonic electro-mechanical response in a gold-ferrocene junction, characterized by an unexpected conductance increase over a factor of ten upon stretching. This response is detected in the formation of ferrocene-assisted atomic gold chain in a mechanically controllable break junction at a cryogenic temperature. DFT based calculations show that tilting of molecules inside the chain modifies the orbital overlap and the transmission spectra, leading to such non-monotonic conductance evolution with stretching. This behavior, unlike typical flat conductance plateaus observed in metal atomic chains, pinpoints the unique role of conformational rearrangements during chain elongation. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the role of orbital hybridization in transport properties and offer new opportunities for designing nanoscale devices with tailored electro-mechanical characteristics.</p>

            <p>The link between bicontinuous architectures in biological membranes and triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) is a well established example of stunning geometric form in nature. The prolamellar body (PLB) in early plant plastid development is a classic example, forming the Diamond TPMS in a lipid-protein-pigment membrane. However, the early development of such spectacular geometric structures is poorly understood. Inspired by the presence of tubules in the micrographs of early plastid membrane formation, we explore here geometric modelling of transformations of packings of cylinders that coalesce together to form bicontinuous structures. Using computational modelling, we find that specific cylinder packings with cubic symmetry transform into highly symmetric TPMS, which now stand as a candidate set of surfaces for further investigation into the PLB, as well as other occurrences of bicontinuous membranes.</p>

            <h2>Permeability heterogeneity and bulk linear elasticity determine interfacial pattern morphologies during confined, miscible displacements of clay suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaibhav Raj Singh Parmar, Ranjini Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>When a less viscous Newtonian fluid displaces an aging aqueous clay suspension in a confined space, a rich array of interfacial patterns emerges due to a predominantly viscous instability. In the present work, we controlled the mechanical properties of clay suspensions by incorporating additives and studied the interfacial instabilities that resulted when these suspensions were radially displaced by water in a Hele-Shaw cell. When the elasticity of clay was low, the interfacial dynamics exhibited features of nonlinear viscous fingering in heterogeneous media. By tuning the nature and content of additives that delay clay aging, we uncovered two novel propagation mechanisms: pattern growth via skewering and zig-zag finger propagation. These patterns have hitherto never been observed in experiments with colloidal systems. For moderate clay elasticities, we demonstrate here that shear-thinning-induced flow anisotropy leads to the formation of dendrites with dominant side branches. As clay elasticity increases due to the incorporation of salts, the energy required to create fractures becomes smaller than that for system-wide yielding. This scenario is characterized by the emergence of viscoelastic fractures. Our work demonstrates that incorporating additives is an effective strategy to manipulate the onset and growth of interfacial instabilities during the confined displacement of clay by miscible Newtonian fluids.</p>

            <p>We present numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo results for the real-time dynamics of the spin polarization in the sub-Ohmic spin--boson model at finite temperature. We focus in particular on the localization and coherence behavior of the model, extending our previous study at low temperature [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056502 (2025)]. As the temperature increases, the system becomes less localized and less coherent. The loss of coherence, which is controlled by two independent mechanisms -- a smooth damping-driven crossover and a sharp frequency-driven transition -- exhibits a nontrivial temperature dependence. While both types of coherence loss occur at lower coupling in the high temperature regime, the frequency exhibits a sharper drop at high temperatures and this drop is observed for all values of the sub-Ohmic exponent, in contrast to the zero-temperature case. We discuss the full temperature-dependent dynamical phase diagram of the system and the interplay between coherence and localization across a wide range of physical parameters.</p>

            <h2>Van der Waals Density Functional for Molecular Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Trevor Jenkins, Kristian Berland, Timo Thonhauser</p>
            <p>Since the development of the nonlocal correlation functional vdW-DF, the family of van der Waals density functionals has grown to better describe a wide variety of systems. A recent generation of the vdW-DF family, vdW-DF3, featured a newly-constructed form of the nonlocal correlation that more accurately modeled molecular dimers, layered structures, and surface adsorption. However, it also revealed an intrinsic tradeoff in vdW-DF3's parametrization and inflexibility of exchange in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), limiting its accuracy for molecular crystals. In this paper we propose a new optimization of vdW-DF3 that is tailored to 3D molecular crystals. This functional, called vdW-DF3-mc, contains a new, tunable form of the exchange enhancement factor with parameters that directly correspond to physically relevant qualities. In addition, within the nonlocal correlation, we prioritize smoothness of the kernel switching function as a means of restoring flexibility to vdW-DF3's design. Testing vdW-DF3-mc on several benchmark sets, we achieve highly accurate energetics and geometries for molecular crystals. This is particularly evident for the case of polymorphs of ice, for which errors in the volume and cohesive energy are on the order of only 1%, indicating very promising performance for important subcategories of molecular crystals, such as polymorphism and hydrogen-bonded solids.</p>

            <p>The nature of relativistic electrons in solids depends on the precise shape of the underlying band structure. Prominently, symmetry-related mechanisms, such as the breaking of time reversal symmetry in topological insulators, can lead to the emergence of band gaps on small energy scales. It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision, and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime.</p>

            <p>Magnetic bimerons in a domain wall provide a practical route for current driven transport in patterned magnetic stripes. However, coupling between bimerons and pinning by defects complicate reliable motion. Here we show that a periodic array of edge defects both stabilizes transport of multiple bimerons and gives rise to a distinctive collective state, the magnetic worm. A single bimeron travels at constant speed; defects lower this speed while preserving an approximately linear relation between velocity $v$ and current density $J$. With two bimerons, the center of mass advances nearly uniformly while their separation exhibits a bounded oscillation whose frequency increases and amplitude decreases with current. For larger trains, these oscillations lose synchrony, producing segmented, worm like motion. The center of mass speed grows with current but decreases as the number of bimerons increases. Notably, eight bimerons cannot be sustained in a smooth stripe but can be stabilized by the periodic defects</p>

            <p>Increasing evidence suggests that active matter exhibits instances of mixed symmetry that cannot be fully described by either polar or nematic formalism. Here, we introduce a minimal model that integrates self-propulsion into the active nematic framework. Our linear stability analyses reveal how self-propulsion shifts the onset of instability, fundamentally altering the dynamical landscape. Numerical simulations confirm these predictions, showing that self-propulsion induces anti-hyperuniform fluctuations, anomalous long-range order in vorticity, and non-universal self-similar energy cascades. Notably, these long-range ordered states emerge within the active turbulence regime well before the transition to a flocking state. Additionally, our analyses highlight a non-monotonic dependence of self-organization on self-propulsion, with optimal states characterized by a peak in correlation length. These findings are relevant for understanding of active nematic systems that self-propel, such as migrating cell layers or swarming bacteria, and offer new avenues for designing synthetic systems with tailored collective behaviours, bridging the gap between active nematics and self-propulsive systems.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting the diffusion equation derivation in Persson's theory of contact</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Xu, Siyuan Yang, Yunong Zhou, Liang Luo</p>
            <p>In Persson's seminal work on tire-road interaction (Persson, J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 115}(8), 2001), he ingeniously derived a diffusion equation in Appendix B to characterize the evolution of contact pressure between a rigid rough indenter and an elastic half-space with spatial magnification, which constitutes the foundation of Persson's theory of contact. Persson's theory has been extensively validated and applied to investigate nearly all critical aspects of tribological problems. In contrast to the well-known Greenwood-Williamson (GW) model, Persson's theory receives relatively less attention within the tribology community. One contributing factor to this discrepancy is that the original derivation of the diffusion equation in Appendix B is not easily understandable to non-physicists. In this technical note, the authors provide supplementary information for each step of the derivation, aiming to clarify the conceptual foundation for researchers who encounter difficulties in understanding Persson's theory, thereby encouraging its broader application within and beyond tribology.</p>

We show how, in this situations, the ensembles are well defined for a continuum of energy values, unlike the purely quantum microcanonical ensemble, thus proving that hybrid systems translate properties of classical systems to the quantum realm. We also analyze the relation with the hybrid canonical ensemble by considering the microcanonical ensemble of a compound system composed of a hybrid subsystem weakly coupled to a reservoir and computing the marginal ensemble of the hybrid subsystem. Lastly, we apply the theory to the statistics of a toy model, which gives some insight on the different properties presented along the article.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide is widely used in electronics, ceramics, and renewable energy due to its exceptional hardness and resistance. In this study, we investigate the effects of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure (both compressive and tensile) on the structural and electronic properties of $3C$-SiC. Our analysis is based on atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an efficient tight-binding Hamiltonian, whose accuracy is validated against density functional theory calculations. Moreover, to account for nuclear quantum effects, we employ path-integral MD simulations. Our results show significant changes in the direct electronic gap as a function of temperature and pressure, with a renormalization of about 80 meV due to zero-point motion. Under hydrostatic tensile pressure, the direct band gap $E_{\Gamma}$ vanishes at the material's mechanical stability limit (spinodal point, where the bulk modulus $B \to 0$). For uniaxial pressure, we observe instabilities (Young's modulus $Y \to 0$) at approximately 90 GPa for both tension and compression, where $E_{\Gamma} \to 0$. Additionally, we analyze the pressure dependence of the internal energy, lattice parameter, and bond length, along with their finite-temperature fluctuations, which exhibit anomalies near the instability points.</p>

Despite the abundance of structural studies and theoretical reports on its electronic structure, there are scarce references on its experimental band structure. By means of Angle Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES), we have probed the experimental electronic structure of covellite. We compare our results with the predictions of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our experimental data are in remarkable agreement with the calculations, revealing subtle fingerprints of the structural phase transition, and confirming the quasi-2D nature of the electronic structure of CuS.</p>

            <p>In two-dimensional (2D) nearly square-lattice quantum materials, electron correlations can induce an electronic nematic phase with twofold rotational ($C_2$) symmetry that profoundly impacts their properties. For 2D materials with threefold rotational ($C_3$) symmetry, such as the honeycomb lattice, a vestigial three-state Potts nematic order has been observed in the van der Waals antiferromagnet (AFM) FePSe$_3$ via optical and thermodynamic methods under uniaxial strain. Here, we use neutron scattering to study the magnetic order and spin excitations of FePSe$_3$ under uniaxial strain. In the AFM ordered state, we find that $\sim$0.6% tensile strain significantly suppresses one zigzag domain and promotes the other two, lowering the AFM order and spin waves to $C_2$ symmetry. The broken $C_3$ symmetry in spin excitations persists slightly above $T_{\rm{N}}\approx 108.6$ K, where the zigzag AFM order is absent. Our results thus provide direct evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and suggest that the three-state Potts nematicity in paramagnetic spin excitations arises from the vestigial order associated with the low-temperature zigzag AFM order.</p>

            <p>Medium-range order (MRO) is a key structural feature of amorphous materials, but its origin and nature remain elusive. Here, we reveal the MRO in amorphous arsenic (a-As) using advanced atomistic simulations, based on machine-learned potentials derived using automated workflows. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental structure factor of a-As, especially the first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP), which is a signature of MRO. We compare and contrast the structure of a-As with that of its lighter homologue, red amorphous phosphorus (a-P), identifying the dihedral-angle distribution as a key factor differentiating the MRO in both. The pressure-dependent structural behaviors of a-As and a-P differ as well, which we link to the interplay of ring topology and structural entropy. We finally show that the origin of the FSDP is closely correlated with the size and spatial distribution of voids in the amorphous networks. Our work provides fundamental insights into MRO in an amorphous elemental system, and more widely it illustrates the usefulness of automation for machine-learning-driven atomistic simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evan M. Wilson, Joseph A. Prescott, Jason T. Haraldsen</p>
            <p>Understanding the effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has become increasingly important in the context of nanoscale magnetism and spintronics. In this study, we derive a general structure factor equation for an S = 1/2 dimer and show that the anisotropic ratio $D_z/|J|$ and complex phase $\phi$ of the DMI control the gap energy and intensity of the $|0,0\rangle \to |1,0\rangle$ transition. {Using exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg spin-spin Hamiltonian that incorporates both isotropic and anisotropic interactions,} as well as the effects of an external magnetic field and an electric field. Our results show that the DM interaction splits energy eigenstates, induces level repulsion, and significantly modifies the spin dimer structure factor. These effects reveal a direct correspondence between thermodynamic anomalies in the heat capacity and spin-resolved selection rules.</p>

            <p>Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moiré band engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D moiré structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient. Our results establish moiré superlattices as a versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-limited conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene revealed by giant terahertz photoresistance</h2>

            <p>Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Floquet multiple exceptional points with higher-order skin effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurab Kumar Dash, Subhendu Kumar Patra, Diptiman Sen, Manisha Thakurathi</p>
            <p>We investigate the rich non-equilibrium physics arising in periodically driven open quantum systems, specifically those realized within microcavity resonators, whose dynamics are governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian hosting Floquet Exceptional Points (FEPs). By introducing a periodically quenched driving protocol, we analytically derive the Floquet effective Hamiltonian and determine the locations of multiple FEPs harbored within the Floquet bulk bands. We demonstrate that the pair-production and annihilation of these FEPs can be precisely controlled by fine-tuning the system parameters, and zero and $\pi$ FEPs are topologically characterized by robust integer quantized winding numbers. To probe these singularities, we introduce a bi-orthogonal Floquet fidelity susceptibility, whose value exhibits large non-zero peaks at the momentum points hosting FEPs in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the momentum-summed susceptibility displays a sharp divergence when the number of FEPs change with respect to the time period of the drive. Our findings also reveal the emergence of Floquet edge states around zero energy and Dirac-like dispersion around $\pi$. Moreover, our model reveals a higher-order skin effect, where the periodically driven Hamiltonian hosts skin modes localized at both edges and corners. These insights offer novel avenues for the Floquet engineering of topological singularities in driven dissipative systems, with significant potential for manipulating light and matter at the microscale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryu Suzuki, Shintaro Hokada, Satoshi Takada</p>
            <p>This study presents an analytical investigation of stress distributions in square-shaped elastic bodies subjected to concentrated compressive loads under uniaxial and biaxial conditions. By employing the Airy stress function method, we derive closed-form solutions that satisfy the governing biharmonic equation and the prescribed boundary conditions along the edges of the square domain. The stress components are expressed as series expansions, with coefficients determined to enforce boundary constraints. In the uniaxial compression case, the resulting stress fields exhibit strong agreement with photoelastic fringe patterns previously observed in experimental studies. For biaxial loading, the solution represents a superposition of two orthogonal compression scenarios, producing spatial variations in the principal stress difference depending on the location within the domain.</p>

            <p>Mössbauer spectroscopy is widely used in biochemistry, geology, and solid-state physics to obtain structural information on materials. Here, we extend this technique into the optical range using a vacuum ultraviolet laser to probe the low-energy nuclear transitions of thorium-229, doped in calcium fluoride crystals. We discover four distinct doping sites for the thorium ions, determine the characteristic electric field gradients emerging in the interaction with the host crystal, and identify the microscopic structure of the two dominant configurations. Site-selective laser excitation allows to study the isomeric state lifetime and laser-induced quenching for all sites. This laser-based Mössbauer spectroscopy provides a powerful probe of the nuclear environment, yielding foundational data for designing future solid-state nuclear clocks.</p>

            <h2>Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields in Doped Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Cao, Paulette Clancy</p>
            <p>Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy, and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material, Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories, as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures, predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware active learning strategies.</p>

            <p>Advanced scientific user facilities, such as next generation X-ray light sources and self-driving laboratories, are revolutionizing scientific discovery by automating routine tasks and enabling rapid experimentation and characterizations. However, these facilities must continuously evolve to support new experimental workflows, adapt to diverse user projects, and meet growing demands for more intricate instruments and experiments. This continuous development introduces significant operational complexity, necessitating a focus on usability, reproducibility, and intuitive human-instrument interaction. In this work, we explore the integration of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), as a transformative tool to achieve this goal. We present our approach to developing a human-in-the-loop pipeline for operating advanced instruments including an X-ray nanoprobe beamline and an autonomous robotic station dedicated to the design and characterization of materials. Specifically, we evaluate the potential of various LLMs as trainable scientific assistants for orchestrating complex, multi-task workflows, which also include multimodal data, optimizing their performance through optional human input and iterative learning. We demonstrate the ability of AI agents to bridge the gap between advanced automation and user-friendly operation, paving the way for more adaptable and intelligent scientific facilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas J. Sullivan, Julio J. Valdés, Kirk H. Bevan, Peter Grutter</p>
            <p>Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a valuable technique by which one can investigate the physical characteristics of the surfaces of materials. However, its widespread use is hampered by the time-consuming nature of running an experiment and the significant domain knowledge required. Recent studies have shown the value of multiple forms of automation in improving this, but their use is limited due to the difficulty of integrating them with SPMs other than the one it was developed for. With this in mind, we propose an automation framework for SPMs aimed toward facilitating code sharing and reusability of developed components. Our framework defines generic control and data structure schemas which are passed among independent software processes (components), with the final SPM commands sent after passing through an SPM-specific translator. This approach permits multi-language support and allows for experimental components to be decoupled among multiple computers. Our mediation logic limits access to the SPM to a single component at a time, with a simple override mechanism in order to correct detected experiment problems. To validate our proposal, we integrated and tested it with two SPMs from separate manufacturers, and ran an experiment involving a thermal drift correction component.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Y. Toriyama, Jiawei Zhan, Shun Kanai, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can host qubits with long spin coherence time (T2) have the distinct advantage of integrating easily with existing microelectronic and photonic platforms, making them attractive for designing novel quantum devices with enhanced performance. However, the relative lack of 2D materials as spin qubit hosts, as well as appropriate substrates that can help maintain long T2, necessitates a strategy to search for candidates with robust spin coherence. Here, we develop a high-throughput computational workflow to predict the nuclear spin bath-driven qubit decoherence and T2 in 2D materials and heterostructures. We initially screen 1173 2D materials and find 190 monolayers with T2 > 1 ms, higher than that of naturally-abundant diamond. We then construct 1554 lattice-commensurate heterostructures between high-T2 2D materials and select 3D substrates, and we find that T2 is generally lower in a heterostructure than in the bare 2D host material; however, low-noise substrates (such as CeO2 and CaO) can help maintain high T2. To further accelerate the material screening effort, we derive analytical models that enable rapid predictions of T2 for 2D materials and heterotructures. The models offer a simple, yet quantitative, way to determine the relative contributions to decoherence from the nuclear spin baths of the 2D host and substrate in a heterostructural system. By developing a high-throughput workflow and analytical models, we expand the genome of 2D materials and their spin coherence times for the development of spin qubit platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktor G. Czinner, Hideo Iguchi</p>
            <p>The Hawking-Rényi model requires the Rényi entropy thermodynamic temperature of a black hole to be identical with the surface gravity defined-, Hawking temperature. We investigate this approach for stationary black hole space-times, and show that a locally Kiselev-type behavior around the horizon with a coupled anisotropic fluid is sufficient to provide a solution to the problem. In addition, due to the rotating motion, an extra shift has also to be present in the effective mass of the black hole, which is determined by the rotation parameter, $a$, and the Rényi parameter, $\lambda$. We consider space-times with and without electric charge, and show that the functional form of the solution is the same for both cases. A full thermodynamic analysis of the model falls beyond the scope of this Letter, the main achievements are the derivation and interpretation of the solution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Omranpour, Jörg Behler</p>
            <p>Co$_3$O$_4$ is an important catalyst for the oxidation of organic molecules in the liquid phase. Still, understanding the atomistic details of Co$_3$O$_4$-water interfaces under operando conditions remains extremely challenging. While ab initio molecular dynamics have become an essential tool for investigating these dynamic interfaces in silico, they are limited to only a few picoseconds and a few hundred atoms. In this work, we overcome these limitations by training a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) on density functional theory data, which allows us to significantly extend the accessible time and length scales. Employing this HDNNP, we perform simulations to unravel the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of Co$_3$O$_4$(001)-water interfaces in detail. Our simulations reveal distinct characteristics of the two possible A and B terminations. The B-terminated surface stabilizes a compact, quasi-epitaxial hydration layer with strong templating effects, enhanced hydroxylation, and a well-organized hydrogen-bond network. In contrast, the A-termination forms a more diffuse contact layer with weaker templating, lower hydroxylation, and less ordered interfacial water. Extended simulations further uncover proton transfer pathways, including intermittent protonation of surface hydroxyls, migration of water molecules into the epitaxial layer, and rare hydronium-like configurations.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum dynamics of a particle confined in a twisted tube with a linearly varying cross section. By relating a general linear transformation matrix to the system's Hamiltonian, we use an extended thin-layer method to derive an effective Hamiltonian for tangential motion under mild and general linear transformations. Explicit forms are provided for three fundamental transformations: rotation, scaling, and shearing. Rotation introduces a gauge field coupled to angular momentum, while scaling and shearing produce geometric potentials that lift degeneracies in non-circular cross sections. In square cross sections, these transformations cause energy splittings among formerly degenerate states, whereas circular cross sections retain degeneracy. Through an example combining rotation and squeezing, we analyze state evolution and compute the quantum geometric tensor to quantify geometric response. Our results demonstrate how geometric transformations can tailor quantum states and suggest that circular waveguides are more robust against mode mixing.</p>

            <p>Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p>Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is a well-established method for studying the dynamic response of matter in the femtosecond or optical range. In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions are propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any observable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform, spectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available codes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS equations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their analysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation because they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code, but an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a modular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our package can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced densities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its current version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but can readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under the assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the response to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band perturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent excitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples, for systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules.</p>

            <p>Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</p>

            <p>Let \(\mathcal{A}\) be a finite-dimensional real (or complex) C*-algebra, \(\Omega_{A}\) an aperiodic subshift of finite type, and \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\) the set of continuous functions from \(\Omega_{A}\) to \(\mathcal{A}\). The shift $\sigma$ provides dynamics. Given a real Lipschitz potential $\varphi\in \mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A}))$, where $\mathfrak{L}(\mathcal{A})$ is the set of linear operators acting on a real $\mathcal{A}$, we introduce a noncommutative analogue of Ruelle's operator, which acts on \(\mathcal{C}(\Omega_{A}; \mathcal{A})\). Assuming the positivity-improving hypothesis, we prove a version of Ruelle's Theorem whenever the operator is normalized. An eigenstate (a linear functional) invariant for the action of the noncommutative Ruelle's operator will play the role of the Gibbs probability of Thermodynamic Formalism; to be called a Gibbs eigenstate. We introduce the concept of entropy for a Gibbs eigenstate (obtained from a certain family of potentials $\varphi$) - generalizing the classical one. In our setting, there is currently no direct relationship with cocycles and Lyapunov exponents. We present examples illustrating the novelty of the cases that can be considered, ranging from topics related to quantum channels to Pauli matrices. Interesting cases: $\mathcal{A}=M_{N \times N}(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathcal{A}= \mathbb{R}^{N}$.</p>

In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for groundstates of Lifshitz theories, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of Rényi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are directly related to Rényi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.</p>

We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0<\gamma<\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</p>

            <h2>Entropy Flow at the Quantum Limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco A. Jimenez-Valencia, Parth Kumar, Yiheng Xu, Ferdinand Evers, Charles A. Stafford</p>
            <p>Thermal management is a key challenge, both globally and microscopically in integrated circuits and quantum technologies. The associated heat flow $I_Q$ has been understood since the advent of thermodynamics by a process of elimination, $I_Q{=}I_E{-}\mu I_N$, subtracting from the energy flow $I_E$ its convective contribution. However, in the quantum limit, this formula implies the paradoxical result that the entropy entrained by heat flow is unbounded even though the entropy itself tends to zero. We resolve this conundrum by recognizing that the traditional formula for heat is missing a quantum term. The correct quantum formula predicts that the heat produced in quantum processes is vastly smaller than previously believed, with correspondingly beneficial consequences for the efficiency of quantum machines.</p>

            <h2>Vacuum currents in elliptic pseudosphere tubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Saharian, G. V. Mirzoyan</p>
            <p>We examine the effects of spatial topology, curvature, and magnetic flux on the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a charged scalar field in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime. The elliptic pseudosphere is considered as an exactly solvable background geometry. The topological contribution is separated in the Hadamard function for general phases in the periodicity condition along the compact dimension. Two equivalent expressions are provided for the component of the current density in that direction. The corresponding VEV is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with a period equal to the flux quantum. In the flat spacetime limit, we recover the result for a conical space with a general value of the planar angle deficit. Near the origin of the elliptic pseudosphere, the effect of the spatial curvature on the vacuum current density is weak. The same applies for small values of the length of the compact dimension. Using the conformal relations between the elliptic pseudosphere and the (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with a planar angle deficit, we determine the current densities for a conformally coupled massless scalar field in the static and hyperbolic vacuum states of locally de Sitter spacetime.</p>

            <h2>Response function as a quantitative measure of consciousness in brain dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenkang Du, Haiping Huang</p>
            <p>Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.</p>

            <p>On-surface synthesis has allowed for the tuneable preparation of numerous molecular systems with variable properties. Recently, we demonstrated the highly selective synthesis of kekulene (>99%) on Cu(111) and isokekulene (92%) on Cu(110) from the same molecular precursor (Ruan et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2025, e202509932). Scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips can identify the single molecules on the basis of their geometric structure at a low coverage on Cu(110), but it also detects complex features due to electronic contributions close to the Fermi energy. Here, we investigate the origin of these features by simulating STM images based on a weighted sum of multiple molecular orbitals, for which we employ weights based on the calculated molecular-orbital projected density of states. This allows for an experimental confirmation of charge transfer from the surface into multiple formerly unoccupied molecular orbitals for single molecules of kekulene as well as isokekulene in its two nonplanar adsorption configurations. In comparison, the area-integrating photoemission orbital tomography technique confirms the charge transfer as well as the high selectivity for the formation of a full monolayer of mainly isokekulene on Cu(110). Our STM-based approach is applicable to a wide range of adsorbed molecular systems and specifically also suited for strongly interacting surfaces, nonplanar molecules, and such molecules which can only be prepared at extremely low yields.</p>

            <p>AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjay Sarkar, Debottam Mandal, Amit Agarwal</p>
            <p>Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a key nonlinear optical process for ultrafast imaging, terahertz (THz) signal generation, and symmetry-sensitive probes, often dominating in centrosymmetric materials where lower-order responses vanish. Yet, the role of band geometry, Fermi surface effects, and disorder in enabling large and tunable THG remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a finite-frequency quantum kinetic theory of THG based on the density matrix formalism, deriving the third-harmonic conductivity tensor. Our framework isolates five distinct band-geometric contributions to interband and intraband processes, separates Fermi sea from Fermi surface terms, and incorporates disorder effects phenomenologically. We further provide a complete symmetry classification of THG for all 122 magnetic point groups. Applying the theory to the spin-split altermagnet RuO$_2$, we trace its THG response to specific geometric terms. These results establish a predictive foundation for designing materials with enhanced and tunable THG in the finite-frequency regime.</p>

            <p>We introduce the multispecies totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (mTASEP) with long-range swap, a new interacting particle system combining the backward-push rule with the forward-jump rule. Although governed by local dynamics, the model induces effective long-range particle exchanges. We establish its integrability by proving two-particle reducibility and showing that the associated scattering matrix satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. In addition, we derive explicit contour integral formulas for transition probabilities. These results position the long-range swap model as a novel exactly solvable multispecies process, characterized by distinctive algebraic features and opening new directions for further study in integrable probability and statistical mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emmanuel Jehanno, Romain Menegaux, Julien Mairal, Sergei Grudinin</p>
            <p>Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).</p>

            <p>The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been extensively investigated as it offers a novel playground for two-dimensional quantum sensing, with ultimate proximity to target samples. However, its practical sensitivity is limited by the intrinsically weak photoluminescence of the spin ensemble. Here, we report a photoluminescence enhancement of up to 30 times from VB- centers in suspended regions of hBN compared to those in substrate-supported areas. The key spin properties, such as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast and linewidth, as well as the spin lifetime, of the VB- centers in this region are well preserved. Detailed investigations, including measurements of zero-field ODMR, Raman spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy, reveal a correlation between emission enhancement and local deformation in the sample. It is concluded that the suspended regions exhibit higher local deformation compared to the supported areas, breaking the local symmetry and thereby activating otherwise forbidden or weak optical transitions of the VB- centers.</p>

            <h2>Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan P. Honda</p>
            <p>Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion number density becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion number density, $n_f$. For sufficiently large $n_f$ and low velocity, the collision of two vortices results in a pseudostable bound state with winding number $m=2$ that eventually becomes unstable and decays into two $m=1$ vortices. For large $n_f$ and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.</p>

            <p>A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise, namely, they acquire the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, the consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, the consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps (if initial opinions are in a general position). The number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is equal to $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps, e.g., we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesca Giuffrida, Diego Garlaschelli, Peter Grünwald</p>
            <p>E-values have recently emerged as a robust and flexible alternative to p-values for hypothesis testing, especially under optional continuation, i.e., when additional data from further experiments are collected. In this work, we define optimal e-values for testing between maximum entropy models, both in the microcanonical (hard constraints) and canonical (soft constraints) settings. We show that, when testing between two hypotheses that are both microcanonical, the so-called growth-rate optimal e-variable admits an exact analytical expression, which also serves as a valid e-variable in the canonical case. For canonical tests, where exact solutions are typically unavailable, we introduce a microcanonical approximation and verify its excellent performance via both theoretical arguments and numerical simulations. We then consider constrained binary models, focusing on $2 \times k$ contingency tables -- an essential framework in statistics and a natural representation for various models of complex systems. Our microcanonical optimal e-variable performs well in both settings, constituting a new tool that remains effective even in the challenging case when the number $k$ of groups grows with the sample size, as in models with growing features used for the analysis of real-world heterogeneous networks and time-series.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew R.C. Fitzpatrick, Arthur M. Blackburn, Cristina Cordoba</p>
            <p>The accuracy of the information that can be extracted from electron diffraction patterns is often limited by the presence of optical distortions. Existing distortion characterization techniques typically require knowledge of the reciprocal lattice of either the sample of interest or a separate calibration sample, the latter of which would need to be swapped in, thus adding time and inconvenience to an experiment. To overcome this limitation, we develop a deep learning (DL) framework for measuring and correcting combinations of different types of optical distortion in CBED patterns. Quantitative performance tests of our DL model are conducted using testing datasets of artificial distorted CBED patterns of molybdenum disulfide on amorphous carbon, with varying sizes of CBED disks, that are generated using multislice simulations. The performance test results of our DL approach are benchmarked against those obtained using a conventional distortion estimation technique that uses the radial gradient maximization (RGM) technique and knowledge of the reciprocal lattice system. While the RGM approach outperforms our DL approach for the CBED patterns with very small disks, our DL approach outperforms the RGM approach for the CBED patterns with medium-sized disks, as well as those with large overlapping disks. The benchmarking results suggest that our DL approach, which does not require knowledge of the sample, achieves a good compromise between convenience and accuracy. We also show how our DL framework can be used to improve experimental ptychographic reconstructions, and to correct optical distortion in experimental selected area electron diffraction patterns.</p>

            <p>Separation of hydrocarbon isomers with closely matched physicochemical properties remains an energetically demanding challenge in the petrochemical refineries. This study presents a comparative analysis of three methods: the fractional distillation, the Molex process, and the Levi-Blow (LB) technique. Using experimentally validated thermodynamic data and heat-transfer estimates, we quantify the energy expenditure and number of cycles required to achieve ultrahigh-purity separation. The LB method achieves eight-9s purity in a single cycle with just 39.4~kJ/mol, while fractional distillation and Molex require multiple iterations and up to five orders of magnitude more energy. Each method is also benchmarked against the thermodynamic minimum work of separation of the mixture of interest. It is found that the LB technique operates within a factor of 23 of this lower bound, compared to $\sim 10^2$ for Molex (Molex is a trademark and/or service mark of UOP Inc.) and $\sim 10^5$ for fractional distillation, demonstrating its thermodynamic and operational superiority.</p>

            <p>Anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit direction-dependent optical and electronic properties, making them valuable for tailoring directional light-matter interactions. Rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) stands out for its strong in-plane anisotropy and its thickness-independent direct-bandgap excitons, which can hybridize with light to form exciton-polaritons. In parallel, metasurfaces, engineered arrays of nanoscale subwavelength resonators, can support ultra-sharp photonic modes in the form of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs). Topological transformations of photonic modes can give rise to flatbands, i.e., dispersionless states with quenched kinetic energy and vanishing group velocity. Intrinsic material anisotropy offers an unexplored route to robust far-field flatband formation and control. Here, we demonstrate how structuring an intrinsically anisotropic excitonic material into a resonant metasurface fundamentally transforms its photonic topological features and light-matter coupling behavior, allowing us to drive and topologically control extended far-field flatband formation. To this end, we fabricate C$_4$-symmetric metasurfaces directly from bulk ReS$_2$. The intrinsic anisotropy lifts the initial double degeneracy of the qBIC mode and yields two distinctly polarized resonances. It also reshapes the topological landscape: the integer topological charge of the qBIC mode splits into momentum-separated half-integer singularities, thereby flattening the far-field photonic dispersion. The resulting topologically-controlled photonic flatbands are then tuned in resonance with the linearly polarized excitonic transitions of ReS$_2$, resulting in two distinct, directionally hybridized exciton-polariton flatband regimes. These findings establish anisotropic vdW metasurfaces as a new platform for topologically engineered flatbands and flatband-driven light-matter coupling.</p>

            <p>Many living and artificial systems improve their fitness or performance by adapting to changing environments or diverse training data. However, it remains unclear how such environmental variation influences adaptation, what is learned in the process, and whether memory of past conditions is retained. In this work, we investigate these questions using athermal disordered systems that are subject to cyclic inverse design, enabling them to attain target elastic properties spanning a chosen range. We demonstrate that such systems evolve toward a marginally absorbing manifold (MAM), which encodes memory of the training range that closely resembles return-point memory observed in cyclically driven systems. We further propose a general mechanism for the formation of MAMs and the corresponding memory that is based on gradient discontinuities in the trained quantities. Our model provides a simple and broadly applicable physical framework for understanding how adaptive systems learn under environmental change and how they retain memory of past experiences.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error. Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.</p>

            <p>We consider conformal field theories with central charges $(c,{\overline c})=(1,1)$ that are invariant under the exchange of the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors, in both bosonic and fermionic realizations that are meaningful for condensed matter systems. The effect of marginal current-current $(J,{\overline J})$ perturbations is to induce a deformation of the Hilbert space given by a Lorentz boost in the 2D space of currents, which is identified with a Bogoliubov transformation. The rapidity of the boost is determined by the coupling constant of the marginal perturbation. When the perturbation is diagonal in the original currents of the theory, there is a linear relation between the two, and non-linear otherwise. In the fermionic cases, both free and with Calogero-Sutherland interactions, the marginal perturbation corresponds to backward scattering processes.</p>

            <p>Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self- supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications, as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters coupled to waveguides with nonlinear dispersion show rich quantum dynamics with the promise of implementing non-trivial non-Markovian quantum models. Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow the realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most implementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide coupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a high-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \emph{giant atom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces interference with the CCA eigenmodes, selectively enhancing interaction with long-wavelength (low-effective $k$), symmetric modes about the array center, while suppressing coupling to antisymmetric and short-wavelength modes. For a subset of symmetric, low-effective $k$ modes, we reach the superstrong coupling regime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal strongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit participation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in agreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show clear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the emergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking inversion symmetry, the qubit seeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit, which we exploit to implement and characterize a chiral photon-emission protocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode light--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment.</p>

            <p>Quantum batteries, which can be seen as energy- or state-storage devices exploiting coherence and other quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here we show that, when suitably engineered, environmental noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery. To explore this interplay, we study a system size N=6, which provides large storage capacity with moderate computational cost, and more importantly, allows the stored energy to become almost fully extractable since the ergotropy nearly coincides with the total capacity. We analyze three local noise channels: bit flip, phase flip, and bit phase flip. We vary the strength of each channel to emulate frequent environmental monitoring, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect, and track its influence on the charging dynamics and stored energy. The phase-flip channel slows charging under strong noise but stabilizes stored energy and ergotropy. The bit-flip channel enables faster charging but saturates at low capacities, while the bit phase flip channel combines both features. In the discharging stage, different noise channels lead to distinct release dynamics, showing that noise can paradoxically enhance and stabilize quantum battery operation.</p>

            <p>We report an optical dipole trap of strontium monohydroxide (SrOH) with 1400(300) trapped molecules. Through optical pumping, we access vibrational states that are proposed for improved probes of the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) and ultralight dark matter (UDM). For each of these states, the lifetime of trapped molecules is measured, and found to be consistent with spontaneous radiative decay and black-body excitation limits, making this platform viable for these eEDM and UDM searches.</p>

            <p>Fermionic quantum processors are a promising platform for quantum simulation of correlated fermionic matter. In this work, we study a hardware-efficient protocol for measuring complex expectation values of the time-evolution operator, commonly referred to as Loschmidt echoes, with fermions in an optical superlattice. We analyze the algorithm for the Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling as well as at finite doping. The method relies on global quench dynamics and short imaginary time evolution, the latter being realized by architecture-tailored pulse sequences starting from a product state of plaquettes. Our numerical results show that complex Loschmidt echoes can be efficiently obtained for large many-body states over a broad spectral range. This allows one to measure spectral properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model, such as the local density of states, and paves the way for the study of finite-temperature properties in current fermionic quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Grid congestion stymies climate benefit from U.S. vehicle electrification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao Duan, Adilson E. Motter</p>
            <p>Averting catastrophic global warming requires decisive action to decarbonize key sectors. Vehicle electrification, alongside renewable energy integration, is a long-term strategy toward zero carbon emissions. However, transitioning to fully renewable electricity may take decades -- during which electric vehicles may still rely on carbon-intensive electricity. We analyze the critical role of the transmission network in enabling or constraining emissions reduction from U.S. vehicle electrification. Our models reveal that the available transmission capacity severely limits potential CO2 emissions reduction. With adequate transmission, full electrification could nearly eliminate vehicle operational CO2 emissions once renewable generation reaches the existing nonrenewable capacity. In contrast, the current grid would support only a fraction of that benefit. Achieving the full emissions reduction potential of vehicle electrification during this transition will require a moderate but targeted increase in transmission capacity. Our findings underscore the pressing need to enhance transmission infrastructure to unlock the climate benefits of large-scale electrification and renewable integration.</p>

            <p>We present the operating principle of a quantum sensor for electric fields based on networks of Rydberg atoms. The sensing mechanism exploits the dependence of the Rydberg blockade on the electric field, particularly in the vicinity of the Förster resonance - the electric field can be measured through the variation in the size of the blockade radius across the network of Rydberg atoms. Specifically, we track the dynamics of Rydberg excitations in systems of various spatial structures, subjected to different electric field configurations, to monitor the connection between the field and blockade. We also use the density-density correlator to analyse spatially varying (inhomogeneous) electric fields and relate these correlators to the applied fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Nautaa, Kaitlin A. Schaal, Ying-Jie Wang, James P.J. Hall, Shai Pilosof, Manlio De Domenico</p>
            <p>Microbiomes are complex systems comprised of many interacting species. Species can survive harsh or changing conditions by rapid adaptation, a process accelerated by the exchange of genetic material between different species through horizontal gene transfer. Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile genetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species. Therefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a microbial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of antimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes. However, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally focused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates, overlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity of microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of positive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and diverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates population-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show that we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid to be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the conjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community. Then, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and conjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of positive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial communities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new perspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids.</p>

            <p>We analyze the validity of reflection positivity in the classification of invertible phases of quantum spin systems. We provide a mathematical model in which every 2d invertible state admits a reflection-positive representative. We prove that reflection positivity provides a canonical lift from the set of invertible phases to the set of invertible phases protected by a $\mathbb{Z}/N$-rotational symmetry. Using this, we define a refined version of the index recently introduced by the author. This refined version conjecturally provides a microscopic characterization of an invariant that coincides with the chiral central charge $c_-$ when conformal field theory effectively describes the boundary modes.</p>

            <h2>Optimal information injection and transfer mechanisms for active matter reservoir computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek</p>
            <p>Reservoir computing (RC) is a state-of-the-art machine learning method that makes use of the power of dynamical systems (the reservoir) for real-time inference. When using biological complex systems as reservoir substrates, it serves as a testbed for basic questions about bio-inspired computation -- of how self-organization generates proper spatiotemporal patterning. Here, we use a simulation of an active matter system, driven by a chaotically moving input signal, as a reservoir. So far, it has been unclear whether such complex systems possess the capacity to process information efficiently and independently of the method by which it was introduced. We find that when switching from a repulsive to an attractive driving force, the system completely changes the way it computes, while the predictive performance landscapes remain nearly identical. The nonlinearity of the driver's injection force improves computation by decoupling the single-agent dynamics from that of the driver. Triggered are the (re-)growth, deformation, and active motion of smooth structural boundaries (interfaces), and the emergence of coherent gradients in speed -- features found in many soft materials and biological systems. The nonlinear driving force activates emergent regulatory mechanisms, which manifest enhanced morphological and dynamic diversity -- arguably improving fading memory, nonlinearity, expressivity, and thus, performance. We further perform RC in a broad variety of non-equilibrium active matter phases that arise when tuning internal (repulsive) forces for information transfer. Overall, we find that active matter agents forming liquid droplets are particularly well suited for RC. The consistently convex shape of the predictive performance landscapes, together with the observed phenomenological richness, conveys robustness and adaptivity.</p>

            <p>Parametric instabilities are a known feature of periodically driven dynamic systems; at particular frequencies and amplitudes of the driving modulation, the system's quasi-periodic response undergoes a frequency lock-in, leading to a periodically unstable response. Here, we demonstrate an analogous phenomenon in a purely static context. We show that the buckling patterns of an elastic beam resting on a modulated Winkler foundation display the same kind of frequency lock-in observed in dynamic systems. Through simulations and experiments, we reveal that compressed elastic strips with modulated height alternate between predictable quasi-periodic and periodic buckling modes. Our findings uncover previously unexplored analogies between structural and dynamic instabilities, highlighting how even simple elastic structures can give rise to rich and intriguing behaviors.</p>

            <p>We present an all-mechanical protocol for coherent control and full quantum-state reconstruction of the fundamental flexural mode of a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT). Calibrated impulses from a nearby atomic force microscope (AFM) tip serve a dual role: they implement mechanical pi/2 rotations for Ramsey interferometry and realize phase-space displacements for Wigner function tomography via displaced-parity sampling. The same actuator thus unifies control and tomography while avoiding optical heating and eliminating on-chip microwave drive lines at the resonator. We derive explicit control pulse sequences and a master-equation description that map measured signals onto the energy-relaxation and phase-coherence times, as well as onto parity-based quantum signatures, including negative regions of the Wigner function. The approach is compatible with multiple readout modalities: direct AFM deflection, dispersive coupling to a Cooper-pair box, and dispersive microwave cavity probing. Together, these techniques provide complete access to populations, coherence, and parity within a single device architecture. This minimal scheme provides a practical route to all-mechanical quantum control and state-resolved characterization of decoherence in mesoscopic mechanical systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate how the properties of epidemic networks change depending on the availability of different types of data on a disease outbreak. This is achieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate the probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that jointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection between them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of infection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics performed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network properties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved hosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our approach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable examples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia. We find that network properties that are important for the management of the outbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference.</p>

            <p>The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization of isolated quantum systems. While the standard ETH is formulated in the absence of degeneracy, physical systems often possess symmetries that induce degenerate energy eigenstates. In this paper, we investigate ETH in the presence of nontrivial projective representations of Abelian symmetries, which arise naturally from 't Hooft anomalies. We argue that such projective structures can lead to degenerate excited states, and how the ETH can be formulated under such degeneracies. In the presence of projective charges supplied by symmetry operators, our projective-representation ETH indicates that the stationary values of the operators are described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble instead of the standard Gibbs ensemble. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry and degeneracy in quantum thermalization and pave the way for further exploration of the ETH in anomalous symmetry settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Yu, Jiangping Hu, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>The quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect (QPME) is a counterintuitive phenomenon wherein a quantum system relaxes more rapidly through a two-step evolution protocol than through direct evolution under a symmetric Hamiltonian alone. In this protocol, the system first evolves under a symmetry-breaking Hamiltonian and then switches to a symmetric one. We demonstrate that QPME occurs under both real-time and imaginary-time dynamics with respect to $U(1)$-symmetry. Using tilted ferromagnetic initial states, we demonstrate that a transient asymmetric evolution significantly accelerates thermalization or convergence to the ground state for both real-time and imaginary-time evolutions, respectively. The effect is pronounced for small tilt angles, while larger tilts or antiferromagnetic initial states suppress it. Numerical evidence across different system sizes confirms the robustness of QPME, demonstrating its stability in the thermodynamic limit. This finding not only deepens our fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena but also opens new possibilities for accelerating quantum simulation and computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Pradhan, Pratik Mullick, Parongama Sen</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of contrarians in a recently proposed weighted-influence variant of the $q$-voter model. In this framework, non-unanimous influence groups affect the focal agent through weighted contributions governed by a bias parameter $p$. We extend this setting by introducing a fraction $\alpha$ ($\alpha> 0$) of contrarians, defined as agents who systematically oppose the prevailing influence irrespective of whether the group is unanimous or divided. Analytical mean-field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the final states of the system are governed by simple phase boundaries: regions of positive and negative majority separated by the lines $p=1/2$ and $\alpha=1/2$, with equally-mixed states confined to these boundaries. While low contrarian densities are insufficient to overturn the bias, higher values of $\alpha$ systematically drive the system closer to a balanced coexistence of opinions, though exact parity is prevented by the presence of bias $p$. We further analyze the temporal relaxation of opinions and extract the characteristic timescales of convergence. Our findings highlight how contrarians, acting as structured non-conformists, can suppress consensus and maintain opinion diversity, while internal biases ultimately hinder a perfectly even split.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Raman scattering by fast GaN phonon-polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mayssoune Mina, Toni Alhaddad, Olivier Pagès</p>
            <p>Phonon-polaritons propagating in crystal volume offer the possibility of transferring information throughout matter (via phonons) at high (photon-like) velocity and tunable frequency/wavelength in the far-infrared. However, from the phonon-polariton Raman cross section, the phonon and photon advantages seem mutually exclusive. Either the phonon-polaritons are fast (photon-like) but hardly supported by the lattice (not phonon-like), or they are well supported by the lattice (testified by a high Raman efficiency) but slow (not photon-like). An optimal phonon-photon coupling is currently searched for in hexagonal-GaN by near-forward Raman scattering across parallel crystal faces with in-plane singular c-axis. Two accessible phonons, i.e., the ordinary A1 and E1 ones, plus two refractive indices, i.e., the ordinary and extraordinary ones, generate various phonon-polariton candidates. Notably, in perfect forward Raman scattering and in crossed polarizations of the incident (along c) and scattered lights, which, altogether, maximizes the transferred wavevector to the crystal at minimum scattering angle, a fast phonon-polariton, stemming from the bottleneck of the E1 dispersion on entry to the deep photon-like regime, is activated. It is well supported by the lattice since its Raman signal is strong and sharp, enhanced by multi-reflection of the laser beam between crystal faces at near-normal incidence. This fast Raman-enhanced phonon-polariton is interesting for infrared-photonics in that it cumulates the advantages of a photon (speed) and of a phonon (Raman intensity). Besides, it commutates from a phonon-polariton to a phonon by deviating from normal incidence or by permuting the incident and scattered polarizations, with potential applications as a vibrational/optical switch.</p>

            <h2>Inference in Spreading Processes with Neural-Network Priors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Ghio, Fabrizio Boncoraglio, Lenka Zdeborová</p>
            <p>Stochastic processes on graphs are a powerful tool for modelling complex dynamical systems such as epidemics. A recent line of work focused on the inference problem where one aims to estimate the state of every node at every time, starting from partial observation of a subset of nodes at a subset of times. In these works, the initial state of the process was assumed to be random i.i.d. over nodes. Such an assumption may not be realistic in practice, where one may have access to a set of covariate variables for every node that influence the initial state of the system. In this work, we will assume that the initial state of a node is an unknown function of such covariate variables. Given that functions can be represented by neural networks, we will study a model where the initial state is given by a simple neural network -- notably the single-layer perceptron acting on the known node-wise covariate variables. Within a Bayesian framework, we study how such neural-network prior information enhances the recovery of initial states and spreading trajectories. We derive a hybrid belief propagation and approximate message passing (BP-AMP) algorithm that handles both the spreading dynamics and the information included in the node covariates, and we assess its performance against the estimators that either use only the spreading information or use only the information from the covariate variables. We show that in some regimes, the model can exhibit first-order phase transitions when using a Rademacher distribution for the neural-network weights. These transitions create a statistical-to-computational gap where even the BP-AMP algorithm, despite the theoretical possibility of perfect recovery, fails to achieve it.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.</p>

            <p>Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.</p>

In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios >0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$.

These spin systems are equivalent to a set of spinless lattice fermions subjected to a random on site potential and sparse density-density interactions. In the absence of the random magnetic field we also obtain a suppression of the L-R bounds as $ \Delta^{-1} $. These results follow from the application of a general theorem about the L-R bound of a generic local time-dependent one-dimensional spin system with local time-dependent perturbations. Adopting the interaction picture of the dynamics, the large and sparse $ ZZ $ perturbations of the $ XY $ model, with or without disorder, are mapped into high-frequency periodic perturbations. All our results are non-perturbative.</p>

            <p>This article covers thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models that are suitable for the analysis of wetting, adsorption, and related interfacial phenomena in colloidal and multiphase systems. Particular emphasis is made on describing crucial physical assumptions and the validity range of the described theoretical approaches and predictive models. The classical sharp interface treatment of thermodynamic systems where a perfectly smooth surface is assumed to separate homogeneous phases can present significant limitations when analyzing systems that are subject to thermal motion and present multiple metastable states caused by interfacial heterogeneities of nanoscale dimensions. Mesoscopic approaches such as stochastic Langevin dynamics can extend the application of sharp interface models to a wide variety of systems exhibiting metastability as they undergo thermal motion. For such metastable systems, dynamic and kinetic equations can describe the evolution of observable (macroscopic) variables as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. Sufficiently close to equilibrium, Kramers theory of thermally activated escape from metastable states can be effectively employed to describe diverse wetting and interfacial processes via kinetic equations. Future directions for further advancement and application of thermodynamic, dynamic, and kinetic models are briefly discussed in the context of current technological developments involving nanoparticles, nanofluidics, and nanostructured surfaces.</p>

Numerical solution of the Smoluchowski equation and analytical predictions from Kramers theory document distinct regimes at different distances $|\Delta q|=|q-q_E|$ from stable equilibrium at $q=q_E$. The physical diffusivity $D$ prescribed by dissipative effects can be observed farther than a distance $|\Delta q'| \propto (\Delta U'/\ell' + \Delta U/\ell)$. Rescaling the physical diffusivity to account for the fine-scale `roughness' is strictly valid when $|\Delta q| < \Delta q_I \propto (\Delta U'/\ell' - \Delta U/\ell)$. Farther than a critical distance $\Delta q_{II}\propto \Delta U/\ell$ the diffusion process is free of coarse-scale metastable states, which facilitates determining the effective diffusivity $D'$ from the reaction coordinate trajectory. Closer to equilibrium the coarse-scale structure induces two diffusive regimes: nearly logarithmic evolution for $\Delta q_{II} > |\Delta q| > \Delta q_{III}$ and exponential decay over time for $|\Delta q| < \Delta q_{III}\propto 1/\ell$. The effective diffusivity derived in this work is sensitive to the coarse- and fine-scale energy barriers and periods, and for $\ell'/\ell \to 0$ and $\Delta U'/k_B T \gg 1$ agrees closely with mean first-passage time estimates currently employed, which depend solely on the fine-scale energy barrier.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for a Superfluid-to-solid Transition of Bilayer Excitons</h2>

            <p>One of the most spectacular properties associated with Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is superfluidity in which the system exhibits zero viscosity and flows without dissipation. The superfluid phase has been observed in wide ranging Bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid - termed a supersolid. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained elusive. Here we report observation of a superfluid to insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magneto-excitons. Mapping the transport behavior of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature, suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid upon increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase.</p>

            <h2>Towards an ab initio derivation of generalised hydrodynamics from a gas of interacting wave packets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Doyon, Friedrich Hübner</p>
            <p>We present steps towards an ab initio derivation of generalised hydrodynamics in quantum integrable models, starting from the Bethe wave functions, and explained on the example of the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. This includes an identification of the generalised hydrodynamics quasi-particles as wave packets in the quantum model. These wave packets evolve according to a classical particle model and collect two-particle scattering shifts similar to solitons in integrable PDEs. We then discuss potential routes to obtain the generalised hydrodynamics equation for average conserved densities in long-wavelength states from this description. As part of this, we provide an explicit formula for the action of the spectral phase-space density operator on Bethe wave functions, and show that it generates local conserved densities.</p>

            <p>Solids when rapidly and elastically stressed change temperature, the effect proposed by Lord Kelvin is adiabatic thermo-elastic cooling or heating depending on the sign of the stress. A fast sensitive IR camera has measured temperature both decreasing and increasing. Temperature measurements made from the reversible, elastic part of the stress-strain curve during fast uniaxial tensile loading have been investigated. The isentropic temperature cooling from the loading curve is recovered by heating after the specimen fractures when the load is released. These measurements establish for the first time isentropic thermal recovery in two engineering alloys. The materials tested are an AISI 4340 steel and an aluminum 2024 alloy. Measurements of the isentropic thermo-elastic stress cooling are -0.61 K/GPa for steel and -1.7 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic thermo-elastic stress heating is -1.16 K/GPa for steel and -1.6 K/GPa for aluminum alloy. The isentropic, elastic part of the temperature is fully recoverable even after extensive plastic deformation upon fracture.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Sun, Wayne M. Saslow</p>
            <p>In metals with finite magnetization $\vec{M}$, experiment shows that transverse polarized dc spin currents $\vec{J}_{i}$ both decay and precess on crossing a finite sample thickness. The present work uses Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics, with $\vec{M}$ and $\vec{J}_{i}$ as fundamental variables, to develop a theory with aspects of the Landau-Lifshitz theory solely for the $\vec{M}$ of (charged) electronic ferromagnets, and of the Leggett theory for the $\vec{M}$ and $\vec{J}_{i}$ of (uncharged) nuclear paramagnets. As for the ferromagnet of Landau-Lifshitz, $\partial_{t}\vec{M}$ includes a characteristic decay time $\tau_{M}$. As for the nuclear paramagnet, $\partial_{t}\vec{J}_{i}$ includes a characteristic decay time $\tau_{J}$, is driven by the gradient of a (vector) spin pressure, and precesses about a mean-field proportional to $\vec{M}$. The spin pressure has a coefficient $G$ proportional to a velocity squared, and $D_{0}\equiv \frac{1}{2}G\tau_{J}$ serves as an effective diffusion coefficient. These equations apply when spin currents are generated. Using the derived dynamical equations for the magnetization and for the spin current, we obtain the steady state (dc limit) solution whose transverse wavevector squared is complex, with real part from diffusion and imaginary part from precession. The ac case is also considered.</p>

            <p>Gauge fields are ubiquitous in modern quantum physics. In superfluids, quantized vortices can be induced by gauge fields. Here we demonstrate the first experimental observation of vortex nucleations in light-dressed spinor Bose-Einstein condensates under radially-localized synthetic magnetic fields. The light-induced spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling creates azimuthal gauge potentials $\vec{A}$ for the lowest-energy spinor branch dressed eigenstate. The observation of the atomic wave function in the lowest-energy dressed eigenstate reveals that vortices nucleate from the cloud center of a vortex-free state with canonical momentum $\vec{p} = 0$. This is because a large circulating azimuthal velocity field $\propto \vec{p}-\vec{A}$ at the condensate center results in a dynamically unstable localized excitation that initiates vortex nucleations. Furthermore, the long-time dynamics to reach the ground state stops in a metastable state when $|\vec{A}|$ is not sufficiently large. Our observation has reasonable agreement with the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii simulations.</p>

            <p>Phases manifesting topological patterns in functional systems, like ferroelectric and ferromagnetic vortex superlattices, can manifest intricate and apparently ungovernable behavior, typical of frustrated non-ergodic states with high-dimensional energy landscapes. This is also the case for potassium-tantalate-niobate (KTN) crystals. These transparent ferroelectrics manifest remarkable but little-understood metastable domain patterns at optical (micrometer and above) scales near the cubic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition. Here, we formulate the Topological Breakdown Model based on the competition between intrinsic scales of domain-domain collinear and non-collinear interactions associated with polarization-charge screening. The model is able to explain observed KTN mesoscopic domain patterns and phase diagram as a function of temperature and external electric field. Findings include a precise set of sharp and broad percolative transitions that are experimentally verified, validating the model. Our study identifies the central role played by competing topologically protected states, identifying a fundamental link between topological protection and frustration that supports a hitherto unexplored functional non-ergodic arena.</p>

            <h2>Helical $f$-Wave Superconductivity in Cubic Rashba Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Sheng Xu, Zi-Ming Wang, Chui-Zhen Chen, Lun-Hui Hu, Rui Wang, Dong-Hui Xu</p>
            <p>The Rashba effect--a momentum-dependent spin splitting from broken inversion symmetry--is a crucial component for engineering topological superconductors (TSCs). However, time-reversal invariant TSCs based on conventional linear Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) are fundamentally restricted to a helical $p$-wave state, hosting only a single Majorana Kramers pair. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the unique triple-winding spin texture of cubic RSOC offers a direct pathway to surpass this limitation. We propose a bilayer model where the synergy of cubic RSOC and an intrinsic odd-parity pairing instability yields a rare 2D helical $f$-wave TSC. This state is characterized by a large mirror Chern number (MCN) ${\cal N}_{\text{M}}=3$ and hosts three Kramers pairs of Majorana edge modes. Furthermore, the interplay of linear and cubic RSOCs can yield a hybrid helical $p+f$-wave TSC with an even larger MCN of ${\cal N}_{\text{M}}=4$. Our work establishes higher-order spin-orbit coupling as a powerful design principle for realizing TSCs with multiple Majorana Kramers channels, holding immediate relevance for tunable platforms like oxide heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Repplinger, Songtao Huang, Yunpeng Ji, Nir Navon, Hadrien Kurkjian</p>
            <p>At low temperature, a normal gas of unpaired spin-1/2 fermions is one of the cleanest realizations of a Fermi liquid. It is described by Landau's theory, where no phenomenological parameters are needed as the quasiparticle interaction function can be computed perturbatively in powers of the scattering length $a$, the sole parameter of the short-range interparticle interactions. Obtaining an accurate solution of the transport equation nevertheless requires a careful treatment of the collision kernel, {as the uncontrolled error made by the relaxation time approximations increases when the temperature $T$ drops below the Fermi temperature}. Here, we study sound waves in the hydrodynamic regime up to second order in the Chapman-Enskog's expansion. We find that the frequency $\omega_q$ of the sound wave is shifted above its linear departure as $\omega_q=c_1 q(1+\alpha q^2\tau^2)$ where $c_1$ and $q$ are the speed and wavenumber of the sound wave and the typical collision time $\tau$ scales as $1/a^2T^2$. Besides the shear viscosity, the coefficient $\alpha$ is described by a single second-order collision time which we compute exactly from an analytical solution of the transport equation, resulting in a positive dispersion $\alpha>0$. Our results suggest that ultracold atomic Fermi gases are an ideal experimental system for quantitative tests of second-order hydrodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Local mobility variations along recrystallization boundaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Zhang, Yubin Zhang</p>
            <p>Understanding recrystallization boundary migration mechanisms is crucial for materials design. However, the lack of comprehensive mobility data for high-angle grain boundaries in typical polycrystalline samples has impeded gaining insights into the factors that govern boundary migration. Here, we propose an Iterative Mobility Matching (IMM) methodology to determine local mobility values and their spatial variations along recrystallization boundaries in partially recrystallized samples. This method optimizes mobility inputs in a phase field model by matching simulated microstructures with time-series recrystallization experiments. We first validate this method using synthetic data before applying it to real experimental data. For the first time, we reveal a three-order-magnitude variation in local mobility along individual recrystallization boundaries. The results show that local mobility depends strongly on boundary misorientation, and its variation significantly influences boundary dynamics, shedding light on the interplay of factors that impact the observed boundary migration behavior. The IMM methodology offers a new framework for interpreting experimental recrystallization behavior and can be broadly applied to other materials using in situ experiments.</p>

            <p>Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kriti Baweja, David J. Luitz, Samuel J. Garratt</p>
            <p>We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</p>

            <p>We show strong coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and microwave cavity photons at both high and externally controllable magnon frequencies. Using the fully quantum mechanical path-integral method, we study an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) interfaced with a topological insulator (TI), taking Bi$_2$Se$_3$--MnSe as a representative example. We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology.</p>

            <p>Many microswimmers are inherently chiral, and this chirality can introduce fascinating behaviors in a collection of microswimmers. The dynamics become even more intriguing when two types of microswimmers with distinct chirality are mixed. Our study examines a mixture of self-propelled particles with opposite chirality, investigating how the system's characteristics evolve as the magnitude of chirality is varied. In weakly chiral systems, the particles exhibit similar behavior, leading to a globally flocking phase where both types of particles are well-mixed. However, in an intermediate range of chirality, the condensates of different particles are formed as a result of a competition between chirality and self-propulsion. This competition results in interesting phases within the system. We explore the characteristics of these distinct phases in detail, focusing on the roles of self-propulsion speed and chirality.</p>

CFT derives dynamical forces and a complete set of conjugate relations: (i) It yields generalized Maxwell-Onsager relations, applicable far from equilibrium; (ii) It constructs dynamical models from mixed force-observable constraints; and (iii) It reveals new relationships -- including an ``equal-traffic'' rule for optimizing molecular motors, and a ``third Kirchhoff's law'' of stochastic transport -- and can resolve some dynamical paradoxes.</p>

            <p>Many systems, classical or quantum, closed or open, exhibit universal statistical properties. Exciton-polariton condensates, being intrinsically driven-dissipative, offer a promising platform for observing non-equilibrium universal features. By conducting extensive numerical simulations of an incoherently pumped and interacting condensate coupled to an exciton reservoir we show that the effective nonlinearity of the condensate phase dynamics can be finely adjusted across a broad range, by varying the exciton-polariton interaction strength, allowing one to probe three main universal regimes with parameters accessible in current experiments: the weakly nonlinear Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime, where the phase fluctuations dominate, but the phase profile does not become rough, the strongly non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang regime, where the condensate phase fluctuations grow in a superdiffusive manner leading to roughening of the phase, and a vortex-dominated phase emerging at stronger interactions, where both density and phase dynamics play significant roles. Our results provide a unified picture of the phase diagram of 2d exciton-polariton condensates under incoherent pumping, and shed light on recent experimental and numerical observations.</p>

We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.</p>

This property allows testing the system response to the excitation intensity in a very versatile manner. We discover that for low excitation intensities, clustering at the boundaries is always present, even when this is prevented by implementing flower-shaped confining walls. For high excitation intensities, however, clusters are dissolved more or less easily depending on their size. Then, a thorough analysis of the cluster dynamics allows us to depict a phase diagram depending on the number of agents in the arena and the excitation intensity. To explain this, we introduce a simple kinetic model where cluster evolution is governed by a balance between adsorption and desorption processes. Interestingly, this simple model is able to reproduce the phase space observed experimentally.</p>

            <p>Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</p>

            <h2>Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic signaling gradient</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhamet Ibrahimi, Matthias Merkel</p>
            <p>A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.</p>

            <p>Many-body excitons in CrSBr are attracting intense interest in view of their highly anisotropic magneto-optical coupling and their potential for novel optical interfaces within spintronic and magnonic devices. Characterizing the orbital character and propagation of these electronic excitations is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior; however, this information is challenging to access. Ultra-high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a momentum-resolved technique that can address these crucial questions. We present measurements collected at the Cr $L_3$-edge which show a rich spectrum of excitations with a variety of spin-orbital characters. While most of these excitations appear to be localized, the dispersion of the lowest energy dark exciton indicates that it is able to propagate along both the $a$ and $b$ directions within the planes of the crystal. This two-dimensional character is surprising as it contrasts with electrical conductivity and the behavior of the bright exciton, both of which are strongly one-dimensional. The discovery of this propagating dark exciton highlights an unusual coexistence of one- and two-dimensional electronic behaviors in CrSBr.</p>

            <h2>Chiral supersolid and dissipative time crystal in Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianghua Su, Xiping Fu, Yang He, Ying Shang, Kaiyuan Ji, Linghua Wen</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the crucial factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength. This is in stark contrast to the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg interaction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, Rydberg interactions, and nonlinear contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures, including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.</p>

            <h2>Variations of saturation vapor pressure and evaporation rate of liquids with their vaporization enthalpy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuefeng Xu, Chengzhi Yu, Liran Ma</p>
            <p>The phase transition enthalpy of condensed materials can be altered by factors such as electric fields, and such variations in turn affect physical and chemical behaviors including phase equilibrium. However, due to the neglect of non-expansion work, the Clapeyron equation does not account for the effect of changes in phase transition enthalpy on equilibrium. In this paper, by analyzing the electric-field-induced changes in phase transition enthalpy and incorporating the non-expansion work performed on the system, we extended both the Clapeyron and Clausius-Clapeyron equations to explicitly include variations in phase transition enthalpy. Building upon these extensions, analytical expressions for the vapor pressure of liquids and for the total evaporation rate of sessile liquid droplets as functions of the change in vaporization enthalpy have been derived, showing that an approximately 1% decrease in vaporization enthalpy of a liquid can cause an increase of about 20% in its vapor pressure and an almost twofold increase in its evaporation rate. The theoretical predictions by the present equations were compared and found to be in good agreement with the experimental observations.</p>

            <p>Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency {\xi}JDL of Si largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overturns the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies.</p>

            <h2>Prospects for market-specific design of Perovskite-Silicon tandem solar cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karthik Raitani, Pradeep R. Nair</p>
            <p>The quest for optimal perovskite for tandem cell configurations is challenging as it involves several factors ranging from device level performance under field conditions to degradation rates and cost. Here, we first highlight the limitations of traditional detailed balance or Shockley-Queisser (SQ) analysis towards the design of Perovskite/Silicon tandem solar cells. Through well-calibrated numerical simulations, we evaluate geographic location-specific annual energy yield (EY) and quantify the influence of temperature-dependent material and transport parameters. Our results indicate that the EY scales in a near-identical manner with the top cell band gap(EgT) for various geographic locations. In comparison to SQ analysis, our simulations predict a twofold relaxation in the target degradation rates at which perovskites over a broad range of band gaps could yield a comparable levelized cost of Energy (LCOE). These insights are of broad interest for the development of perovskite materials, and test protocols to evaluate the stability of Perovskite-Silicon tandem solar cells.</p>

            <h2>Large Tunable Thermoelectric Effects in Superconducting Spin Valves with Commercially Available Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Tuero, Johanne Bratland Tjernshaugen, Carlos Sanchez, César Gonzalez-Ruano, Yuan Lu, Jacob Linder, Farkhad G. Aliev</p>
            <p>Recent studies have revealed magnetically controllable thermoelectric effects in superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) structures. A tunable cryogenic thermoelectric generator needs not only a high conversion factor between electricity and heat, but also a large change in the thermoelectric output when switching the magnetic state of the device. However, the reported modifications in thermoelectric power are either minimal, involve superconductors with relatively low critical temperatures (below 1 K), or do not utilize commercially available spintronic materials. Here, we experimentally measure and numerically model thermoelectric effects in fully epitaxial F/S/F junctions based on commercially available, easily grown materials, as well as their dependence on the magnetic configuration of the F electrodes. We observe sizeable Seebeck coefficients for the parallel alignment of the ferromagnetic electrodes, reaching values of about $100$~$\mu$V/K. Importantly, we find a decrease of the thermoelectric signal of more than an order of magnitude when switching from a parallel to an antiparallel configuration, constituting a large thermoelectric spin-valve effect. Theoretical modeling based on a self-consistent non-equilibrium Keldysh-Usadel Green's function theory, combined with micromagnetic simulations, qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings. The thermoelectric effect is optimized when there is a large spin-dependent electron-hole asymmetry in the superconductor combined with spin-dependent transmission through the interfaces. These findings pave the way for the development of efficient and versatile cryogenic thermoelectric heat engines.</p>

            <p>RuO$_2$, one of the most widely studied transition metal oxides, was recently predicted to host a novel form of collinear magnetic order referred to as altermagnetism. In this study we combine experiment (reflectance, transmittance, ellipsometry and Raman measurements) and first-principles calculations to elucidate the potential role of altermagnetic order, strain and doping on the optical and vibrational properties of RuO$_2$ grown on TiO$_2$ (001), (101) and (110) substrates. Our combined experimental and theoretical results point toward a nonmagnetic ground state as the most consistent description of the optical and vibrational properties of bulk RuO$_2$. RuO$_2$ strained to TiO$_2$ (001) remains nonmagnetic in our calculations. Straining to TiO$_2$ (110) stabilizes ferromagnetic and altermagnetic states that are nearly degenerate and both lower in energy than the nonmagnetic state. The relative energetic ordering of these states is highly sensitive to the level of strain and the choice of exchange-correlation approximation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Misha Yutushui, Maria Hermanns, David F. Mross</p>
            <p>The observed fractional quantum Hall (FQH) plateaus follow a recurring hierarchical structure that allows an understanding of complex states based on simpler ones. Condensing the elementary quasiparticles of an Abelian FQH state results in a new Abelian phase at a different filling factor, and this process can be iterated \textit{ad infinitum}. We show that condensing clusters of the same quasiparticles into an Abelian state can instead realize non-Abelian FQH states. In particular, condensing quasiparticle pairs in the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ Laughlin state yields the anti-Pfaffian phase at half-filling. We moreover show that the successive condensation of Laughlin quasiparticles produces quantum Hall states whose fillings coincide with the most prominent plateaus in the first excited Landau level of GaAs. More generally, such condensation can realize any non-Abelian FQH state that admits a parton representation. This surprising result is supported by an exact analysis of explicit wavefunctions, field theory arguments, conformal-field theory constructions of trial states, and numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled local moment ``swapover'' and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moiré systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.</p>

            <p>The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds can be utilized as low-cost, highly versatile quantum sensors for studying surface properties in condensed matter physics through the application of relaxometry protocols. For such applications, a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic relaxation processes of NV centers in nanodiamonds is necessary. Here, we study the spin-lattice relaxation rates of NV ensembles in nanodiamonds with average diameters of 40 nm and 3 $\mu$m between room temperature and $\sim$ 6 K. The NV relaxation curves fit to a stretched-exponential form with a stretching exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, implying the large distribution of relaxation times of individual centers within nanodiamonds. We determine the Orbach-like scattering on phonons as the leading relaxation mechanism. Finally, we discuss the viability of nanodiamonds as surface sensors when deposited on a metallic substrate and emphasize the need for well-controlled surface preparation techniques.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic inference in molecular motors: a Martingale approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrián Nadal-Rosa, Gonzalo Manzano</p>
            <p>Molecular motors are in charge of almost every process in the life cycle of cells, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell locomotion, hence being of crucial importance for understanding the cellular dynamics. However, given their size scales on the order of nanometers, direct measurements are rather challenging, and the information that can be extracted from them is limited. In this work, we propose strategies based on martingale theory in stochastic thermodynamics to infer thermodynamic properties of molecular motors using a limited amount of available information. In particular, we use two recent theoretical results valid for systems arbitrary far of equilibrium: the integral fluctuation theorem (IFT) at stopping times, and a family of bounds to the maximal excursions of entropy production. The potential of these strategies is illustrated with a simple model for the F1-ATPase rotary molecular motor, where our approach is able to estimate several quantities determining the thermodynamics of the motor, such as the rotational work of the motor performed against an externally applied force, or the effective environmental temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silvia Neri, Walter Metzner, Dirk Manske</p>
            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconductors show a rich collective mode spectrum. In general, collective excitations in superconductors can provide crucial information on the symmetry of the broken phase, in particular, serving as a fingerprint for determining the groundstate gap symmetry. In this work, we consider several even parity two-dimensional TRSB superconductors characterized by an order parameter of the form $\Delta = \Delta_1 + i\Delta_2$. We provide a classification scheme of the collective excitations in the above systems as a function of the ratio between the components $\Delta_1/\Delta_2$. In order to excite the modes in the systems we have adopted two different probes: a quench of the condensate symmetry and a finite momentum transfer induced by an external electric field. Both methods allow us to excite and characterize the different modes in the spectra. To further interpret the results of the numerical calculations we provide a Ginzburg-Landau analysis and we construct a dynamical theory, deriving the linearized equations of motion in the pseudospin formalism. Our results could help distinguish between different order parameters symmetries of a TRSB superconducting condensate and estimate the magnitude of its different components.</p>

            <h2>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadine Suzan Cetin, Michal Pavelka, Emil Varga</p>
            <p>A standard description of superfluid helium-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations (treated as an ideal Bose gas under the temperature $1.3K$) and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond the HVBK model. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher counter-flow velocities, where the usual splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-fluid model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</p>

            <h2>Collective Dynamics in Active Polar Polymer Assemblies</h2>

            <p>Tangentially driven active polymers (TDAPs), model systems for motor-driven filaments, have been extensively studied in uniform activity fields. Here, we show that an activity gradient breaks fore-aft symmetry, generating net body forces that steer dimers, asters, and larger assemblies toward high-activity regions. Including temporal stochasticity softens the chains, allowing them to bend and wind around other filaments. Once several contacts are established, steric interlocking arrests relative motion and stabilizes the assembly into a hierarchically entangled cluster. These clusters persist for times far exceeding single-chain relaxation and do not appear under deterministic, temporally constant activity. Remarkably, such activity-induced gelation occurs even at polymer concentrations substantially lower than those typically required for passive chains. Our results reveal a new mechanism for activity-induced aggregation, providing new strategies for designing autonomous and reconfigurable microfluidic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Cameron, Elsen Tjhung</p>
            <p>We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</p>

Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use determinate quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulation to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</p>

            <p>Magnetism and spin physics are true quantum mechanical effects and their description usually requires multi reference methods and is often hidden in the standard description of molecules in quantum chemistry. In this work we present a twofold approach to the description of spin physics in molecules and solids. First, we present a method that identifies the single-particle basis in which a given subset of the orbitals is equivalent to spin degrees of freedom for models and materials which feature significant spin physics at low energies. We introduce a metric for the spin-like character of a basis orbital, of which the optimization yields the basis containing the optimum spin-like basis orbitals. Second, we demonstrate an extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation method to derive the effective Hamiltonian acting on the subspace of the Hilbert space in which the charge degree of freedom of electron densities in the spin-like orbitals is integrated out. The method then yields an effective Hamiltonian describing spins coupled to a fermionic environment. This extended Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is applicable to a wide range of Hamiltonians and has been utilized in this work for model Hamiltonians as well as the Hamiltonian describing the active orbital space of molecular chromium bromide. This is achieved by reformulating the highly non-linear Schrieffer-Wolff equations into a linear set of equations corresponding to an operator basis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Zheng, Cunyuan Jiang, Yangrui Chen, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang</p>
            <p>Active matter refers to a broad class of non-equilibrium systems where energy is continuously injected at the level of individual ``particles". These systems exhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium counterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to meter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and self-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these ideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular fluids. Using isotropic granular vibrators as a model experimental system of apolar active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles in a dry environment, we uncover a distinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay between activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics, spatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the displacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe this intrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, associated to these topological defects, we reveal the onset of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where kinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the system evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the duration of observation. Our findings show that topological concepts can be extended to the nonequilibrium dynamics of apolar active matter, revealing a direct link between microscopic topological processes and emergent large-scale behaviors in active granular fluids that lack both a well-defined direction of motion and an intrinsic axis of orientation at the particle scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kühn</p>
            <p>Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. This diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be particularly useful for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.</p>

            <p>The concept of a `persistent worm' is introduced, representing the smallest possible length of a wormlike micelle, and modelled by a bead-spring chain with sticky beads at the ends. Persistent worms are allowed to combine with each other at their sticky ends to form wormlike micelles with a distribution of lengths, and the semiflexibility of a wormlike micelle is captured with a bending potential between springs, both within and across persistent worms that stick to each other. Multi-particle Brownian dynamics simulations of such polydisperse and `polyflexible' wormlike micelles, with hydrodynamic interactions included and coupled with reversible scission/fusion of persistent worms, are used to investigate the static and dynamic properties of wormlike micellar solutions in the dilute and unentangled semidilute concentration regimes. The influence of the sticker energy and persistent worm concentration are examined and simulations are shown to validate theoretical mean-field predictions of the universal scaling with concentration of the chain length distribution of linear wormlike micelles, independent of the sticker energy. The presence of wormlike micelles that form rings is shown not to affect the static properties of linear wormlike micelles and mean-field predictions of ring length distributions are validated. Linear viscoelastic storage and loss moduli are computed and the unique features in the intermediate frequency regime compared to those of homopolymer solutions are highlighted. The inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (HI) enables the distinction between Rouse and Zimm dynamics in wormlike micelle solutions to be elucidated. While the neglect of HI is justified in the case of entangled wormlike micelle solutions, here the concentration at which the onset of the screening of hydrodynamic interactions occurs is clearly identified.</p>

Using a 20 nm thick Al0.64Sc0.36N ferroelectric layer, we evaluate both metal-insulator-ferroelectric-metal (MIFM) and metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) architectures for scaled resistive memory devices. Our scaled devices exhibit an enhanced breakdown-to-coercive field ratio exceeding 2.6 due to increased breakdown field. The MIFM devices demonstrate stable 3-bit non-volatile multistate behavior with clearly distinguishable resistance states and retention exceeding 4*10^4 seconds at 85 C. By achieving more than a million-fold areal scaling with enhanced performance metrics, this work establishes AlScN-based FeDiode memory as a highly promising platform for non-volatile storage with potential for direct integration into CMOS technology.</p>

Here, we propose a general method for building such a phase. This is done by coupling quantum wires placed aperiodically in real-space, where the spatial positioning allows us to tune the inter-wire couplings. We call the emergent phase the Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect as it displays a rich interplay of fractional quantum Hall physics with fractonic constraints, formed by coupling differently-fractionalised wires into a globally gapped phase. The ground state has an exponential degeneracy in system size, a signature of the emergence of fractons. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), multiples of which can then hop between two wires (s-lineons) or be free to travel across the system (C-anyons), depending on the multiplicity. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires, which can be disordered. Our method provides an analytically solvable pathway to non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effects and fractonic theories in two-dimensions, examples of which were lacking.</p>

            <h2>Friedel oscillations in a two-dimensional electron gas and monolayer graphene with a non-Coulomb impurity potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Levente Máthé, Ioan Grosu</p>
            <p>We study Friedel oscillations in a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and in a monolayer graphene in the presence of a single impurity. The potential generated by the impurity is modeled using a non-Coulomb interaction ($\sim r^{-\eta}$). The charge carrier density deviation as a function of distance from the impurity is calculated within the linear response theory. Our results show that, in both a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and graphene, the phase of charge carrier density oscillations remains unaffected by the parameter $\eta$, which characterizes the non-Coulomb nature of the interaction, at large distances from the impurity. The parameter $\eta$ influences only the amplitude of the oscillations in this regime. The results for an impurity modeled by Coulomb-like potential ($\eta = 1$) are recovered in both cases.</p>

            <p>The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Generic (fractional) quantum anomalous Hall crystals from interaction-driven band folding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Bin-Bin Chen, Wang Yao, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>Among the extensive studies of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, there recently appears a growing interest in the topological states with coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders. Such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, compared to those with integer Hall conductivities, the FQAH crystal (FQAHC) is still elusive even at the level of microscopic model. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model on triangular lattice with spinless fermions. At fractional filling of the Chern band, the nearest-neighbor interaction leads to a commensurate and topologically trivial CDW state. Interestingly, the folded mini-band above the CDW gap is non-trivial, and we focus on the doping of it without any projection. A series of (F)QAHC states at (fractional) integer fillings of this mini-band are discovered and some FQAHC state might even exist in less "ideal" conditions. The ground-state degeneracies of such (F)QAHC states are enlarged by the CDW degeneracy and the Hall conductivities -- determined by the fillings of the mini-band -- are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures, which might serve as a precursor of lower temperature FQAHC phase. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that such a generic scheme of doping CDW-folded topological mini-band could be applied to bosonic systems, broadening the platforms of Hall-crystal physics and motivating its exploration in quantum moire and cold-atom systems.</p>

            <h2>Low-energy effective Hamiltonian and end states of an inverted HgTe nanowire</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui Li</p>
            <p>The band inversion transition in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire is inducible via varying the nanowire radius. Here we derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing the band structure of the HgTe nanowire close to the fundamental band gap. Because both the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands have quadratic dependence on $k_{z}$ when the gap closes, we need to consider at least three subbands, i.e., the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands, in building the effective Hamiltonian. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is block diagonal and each block is a $3\times3$ matrix. End states are found in the inverted regime when we solve the effective Hamiltonian with open boundary condition.</p>

            <p>The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</p>

            <h2>Current Conservation in the Self-Consistent Josephson Junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Krekels, Vukan Levajac, Kristof Moors, George Simion, Bart Sorée</p>
            <p>Conventional treatments of Josephson junctions (JJs) are typically not current-conserving. In the mean-field BCS theory, current conservation is only guaranteed if the superconducting order parameter is treated self-consistently. We show that this requirement has significant consequences for the current-phase relation (CPR) in certain regimes, where the current density in the superconducting leads is non-negligible. To this end, we introduce a numerical method for the self-consistent treatment of the BdG equations with current conservation for quasi-1D superconductor-normal (metal)-superconductor (SNS) JJs. Our model incorporates a phase gradient of the order parameter in the leads, which is set to match the Josephson current through the weak link. We compare our method to standard, non-current-conserving approaches by calculating the CPR for SNS JJs while varying lengths and gate voltages controlling the normal metal. We show that current conservation has significant implications for the Josephson harmonics and can weaken or even reverse forward skewness of the CPR.</p>

            <p>Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ maple-leaf Heisenberg antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taras Hutak</p>
            <p>The Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice has recently gathered a great deal of attention. Competition between three nonequivalent bond interactions results in various ground-state quantum phases, the exact dimer-product singlet ground state being among them. The thermodynamic properties of this model are much less understood. We used high-temperature expansion up to the $18$th order to study the thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the uniform maple-leaf lattice with the ground state exhibiting a six-sublattice $120^{\circ}$ long-range magnetic order. Padé approximants allow us to get reliable results up to the temperatures of about $T\approx 0.4$. To study thermodynamics for arbitrary temperatures, we made the interpolation using the entropy method. Based on the analysis of close Padé approximants, we find ground-state energy $e_{0}=-0.53064\ldots -0.53023$ in good agreement with numerical results. The specific heat $c(T)$ has a typical maximum at rather low temperatures $T\approx0.379$ and the uniform susceptibility $\chi(T)$ at $T\approx0.49$. We also estimate the value of $\chi(T)$ at zero temperature $\chi_{0}\approx0.05\ldots0.06$. The ground-state order manifests itself in the divergence of the so-called generalized Wilson ratio.</p>

            <p>Unstable systems of fluidized grains in a very-narrow vertical tube can auto-defluidize after some time, the settling particles forming either a glass- or crystal-like structure. We carried out experiments using different polymer spheres, of known friction and roughness, fluidized in water. A diagram was obtained for the \RefereeA{shell-settled} particles when the coefficient of friction is of the order of 0.1, and their structure is characterized through an analysis of the nearest neighbors' angles. We show that the level of velocity fluctuations is higher for the high friction material, and that, once defluidized, the decrease in the coefficient of sliding friction leads to more organized (crystal-like) structures, while those with higher friction coefficients are amorphous (glass-like structures). Our results bring new insights for understanding the formation of glass- and crystal-like structures based on the material surface properties.</p>

            <h2>Coupling an elastic string to an active bath: the emergence of inverse damping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Beyen, Christian Maes, Ji-Hui Pei</p>
            <p>We consider a slow elastic string with Klein-Gordon dynamics coupled to a bath of run-and-tumble particles. We derive and solve the induced Langevin-Klein-Gordon string dynamics with explicit expressions for the streaming term, friction coefficient, and noise variance. These parameters are computed exactly in a weak coupling expansion. The induced friction is a sum of two terms: one entropic, proportional to the noise variance as in the Einstein relation for a thermal equilibrium bath, and a frenetic contribution that can take both signs. The frenetic part wins for higher bath persistence, making the total friction negative, and hence creating a wave instability akin to inverse Landau damping. However, this acceleration decreases and eventually disappears when the propulsion speed of the active particles becomes much higher. Detailed simulations confirm the initial growth driven by this anti-damping.</p>

Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p < 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <p>Multi-domain states of square artificial spin ice show a range of different morphologies ranging from simple stripe-like domains to more organically shaped coral domains. To model the relevant dynamics leading to the emergence of such diverse domain structures, simplified descriptions of the switching behavior of individual nanomagnets are necessary. In this work, we employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the demagnetization of square artificial spin ice toward its ground state, and compare how the choice of transition barriers affect the emergence of mesoscale domains. We find that the commonly used mean-field barrier model (informed by equilibrium energetics only) results in propagation of ground-state string avalanches. In contrast, taking into account chiral barrier splitting enabled by state-dependent local torques supports the emergence of complex-shaped coral domains and their successful relaxation towards the ground state in later relaxation stages. Our results highlight that intrinsic contributions to switching barriers, in addition to the effect of extrinsic defects often attributed to nanofabrication irregularities, can subtly shift favored transition pathways and result in different emergent mesoscale features. Future kinetic Monte Carlo models that describe the evolution of artificial spin systems should thus account for these effects.</p>

            <h2>Missing link between the 2D Quantum Hall problem and 1D quasicrystals</h2>

            <p>This paper discusses a connection between two important classes of materials, namely quasicrystals and topological insulators as exemplified by the Quantum Hall problem. It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities.</p>

            <p>Möbius topological insulators have dispersive edge bands with Möbius twists in momentum space, which are protected by the combination of chiral and $Z_2$-projective translational symmetries. In this work, we reveal a unique type of Möbius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized Möbius insulator model, we obtain interconnected Möbius edge bands around zero and $\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These Möbius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, which are integer-quantized due to an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such Möbius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet Möbius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of Möbius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of Möbius-twisted topological edge states without static counterparts.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</p>

Our approach leverages a tensor-network representation of the density matrix using a Chebyshev tensor network algorithm, enabling large-scale calculations of topological markers in quasicrystalline and moire systems. We demonstrate our methodology with two-dimensional quasicrystals featuring $C_8$ and $C_{10}$ rotational symmetries and mosaics of Chern phases.

            <p>Reversible control of spin-dependent thermoelectricity via mechanical strain provides a platform for next-generation energy harvesting and thermal logic circuits. Using first-principles and Boltzmann transport calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer NiI$_2$ undergoes a strain-driven semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, enabled by the selective closure of its spin-down band gap while preserving a robust ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, this transition is accompanied by a giant, non-monotonic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, with the Lorenz number enhanced up to $7.17\,L_0$. This anomaly arises from a strain-sensitive hybridization between Ni-$d$ and I-$p$ orbitals, leading to spin-polarized transport channels and decoupling of heat and charge currents. These properties make NiI$_2$ a promising candidate for mechanically gated spin-caloritronic devices and thermal logic elements, where reversible control of heat and spin flow is essential. Our findings position NiI$_2$ as a model system for exploring non-Fermi-liquid transport and for realizing strain-tunable, energy-efficient functionalities in low-dimensional platforms.</p>

The atoms constituting this vortex can be localized in volumes much smaller than the volume occupied by the second component. We also show that the vortex position can be changed dynamically by moving the laser beams, provided the beams' movement speed remains below the speed of sound.

            <p>The calculation of quantum-geometric properties of Bloch electrons -- Berry curvature, quantum metric, orbital magnetic moment and effective mass -- was implemented in a pseudopotential plane-wave code. The starting point was the first derivative of the periodic part of the wavefunction psi_k with respect to the wavevector k. This was evaluated with perturbation theory by solving a Sternheimer equation. Comparison of effective masses obtained from perturbation theory for silicon and gallium arsenide with carefully-converged numerical second derivatives of band energies confirms the high precision of the method. Calculations of quantum-geometric quantities for gapped graphene were performed by adding a bespoke symmetry-breaking potential to first-principles graphene. As the two bands near the opened gap are reasonably isolated, the results could be compared with those obtained from an analytical two-band model, allowing to assess the strengths and limitations of such widely-used models. The final application was trigonal tellurium, where quantum-geometric quantities flip sign with chirality.</p>

            <p>We study nonlinear hydrodynamic electron transport driven by an AC electric field. In noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry the nonlinear flow of such liquids is nonreciprocal, giving rise to a DC current $I^{DC}$ that is quadratic in the amplitude of the AC electric field. This is the hydrodynamic analogue of the linear photogalvanic effect (PGE), which arises in bulk noncentrosymmetric materials with broken TR symmetry. The magnitude of $I^{DC}$ depends on both the properties of the electron fluid and the geometry of the flow, and may be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the nonreciprocity number $\mathcal{N}$, and the frequency-dependent vibrational number $\mathcal{R}$. Due to nonlocality of hydrodynamic transport, at low frequencies of the AC drive, $I^{DC}$ is super-extensive. The AC component of the electric current is likewise strongly affected by nonreciprocity: the hysteretic current-voltage dependence becomes skewed, which can be interpreted in terms of nonreciprocity of the memory retention time.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport calculations: An effective medium theory based on the projector augmented wave method with the plane-wave basis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cheng Lin, Ken-Ming Lin, Yu-Chang Chen</p>
            <p>We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.</p>

            <p>Collective longitudinal and transverse propagating modes in molten Carbon at $T=5500$~K and pressure range $10$-$40$ GPa are reported from {\it ab initio} based as well as machine learned molecular dynamics. A striking exotic feature in collective dynamics is the two-peak shape of the current spectral functions of the single-component liquid, which makes evidence of a second branch of longitudinal propagating modes in the wave number range $k>1$Å$^{-1}$. It is shown that time correlation functions reflecting the out-of-phase motion of particles and their cages of nearest neighbors results in the same frequencies of the exotic low-frequency branch of vibrations. A theoretical framework of generalized collective modes is applied to recover the time dependence of density-density, imaginary part of susceptibility and longitudinal current-current correlations.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic theory of square skyrmion lattice in tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleg I. Utesov, Danila P. Budylev</p>
            <p>High-temperature part of the phase diagram of tetragonal frustrated antiferromagnets is discussed within the framework of the mean-field approach. Based on recent experimental findings, we generalize previous theoretical studies by considering a model that includes frustrated Heisenberg exchange, biquadratic exchange, magnetodipolar interaction, anisotropic exchange, and single-ion anisotropy. It is analytically demonstrated that a subtle interplay among these interactions results in a variety of phase diagrams in the temperature-magnetic field plane. We argue that one of the proposed diagrams reproduces all crucial features of the phase diagram experimentally observed for~\gdru~compound. Besides magnetodipolar interaction and additional easy-axis contribution, it requires moderate biquadratic exchange. We show that despite the remarkable square skyrmion lattice being stable even if only magnetodipolar interaction/compass anisotropy or biquadratic exchange is included, their ``symbiosis'' allows for greatly enhancing its stability region. It is also demonstrated that higher-order harmonics play an important role in the stabilization of the square skyrmion lattice. The developed analytical approach can be useful for the refinement of the microscopic model parameters when comparing its predictions with experimental findings.</p>

Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented.

            <h2>Thermal Hall transport in Kitaev spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsuyoshi Okubo, Joji Nasu, Takahiro Misawa, Yukitoshi Motome</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^{\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\Gamma$ and negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\Gamma^\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Velimir Labinac, Jiayu David Cao, Gaofeng Xu, Igor Žutić</p>
            <p>Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission of circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers, the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.</p>

            <h2>Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Chang Chen, Ken-Ming Lin</p>
            <p>Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology.</p>

            <p>Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuejian Qin Taoyuze Lv, Zhicheng Zhong</p>
            <p>Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities, EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery.</p>

            <p>Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. Time reversal is achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate, which can be readily implemented in simulations and experiments to generate new synthetic data samples driven by active fluctuations. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential, which opens up new avenues to exploit fluctuations in active and living systems for generative AI purposes.</p>

            <p>The mathematical definitions of distinct concepts that are needed in building an ergodicity detection algorithm are introduced in a framework. This algorithmic framework is expressed in a discrete setting in an accessible manner for broader quantitative practitioners without loss of generality. At the same time, the common misconceptions of the requirement of visiting all available states in the time-averaged quantities for physical systems and non-existence of an ergodic process are resolved by introducing the distinction between Gibbs-Boltzmann and von Neumann-Birkhoff ergodic regimes. For this purpose, we introduce a new concept which is called sufficiency of sparse visit. We use finite symbolic random sequences as a pedagogical tool in establishing the different approaches for the detection of ergodic regimes of dynamical systems with vector patterns. The simple example system conveys the different attitudes in ergodicity regimes and offers guidance for building computational tools for its algorithmic detection.</p>

            <p>Symmetry is at the heart of material properties. Symmetry of the Bravais lattice defines the degeneracy of planewaves, upon which atomic symmetry determines interaction potentials which may lift such degeneracies. This results in wavefunctions which are single planewaves throughout the Brillouin zone (BZ), except in the vicinity of lifted degeneracies. This great simplification allows for determination of optical properties from a handful of planewaves and a single transition. Further, it reveals that nonlinear optical response arises from higher order degeneracy along lines/points in the BZ.</p>

            <p>Cadmium telluride (CdTe), lead sulfide (PbS), and indium tin oxide (ITO) play crucial roles in various electronic applications where laser treatment enables precise modification of their distinctive electronic characteristics. This study utilizes the XTANT-3 hybrid/multiscale model to investigate the microscopic response of these materials to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The model simultaneously traces intertwined processes of non-equilibrium dynamics of both electrons and atoms, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials exhibit nonthermal melting at higher doses. When accounting for energy dissipation pathways and material recrystallization processes, damage thresholds increase substantially. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the resulting cooled material becomes increasingly amorphous, progressively reducing the band gap until a stable configuration is reached. Notably, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibits transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. These findings indicate that femtosecond laser technology offers promising opportunities for precise band gap engineering in various photovoltaic semiconductor devices.</p>

            <h2>Strain-induced Ettingshausen effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautham Varma K, Azaz Ahmad, Gargee Sharma</p>
            <p>Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties. Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our study to be particularly timely and relevant.</p>

The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.</p>

            <p>The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins using physically-motivated potentials for non-polar interactions, can identify the biologically correct assembly as the energy-minimizing state. Short-range potentials, however, produce rugged energy landscapes, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional local minimizers. Successful self-assembly simulations depend on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space. We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales. Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore, the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</p>

The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</p>

            <p>The study of the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) assemblies to an external alternating magnetic field is of great interest for applications such as hyperthermia. The key quantity here is the complex susceptibility and its behavior in terms of temperature and frequency. From a theoretical point of view it can be obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with the time quantified Monte Carlo (TQMC) method if a physical time is associated with the MC step. Here we revisit this method by showing that the time unit can be derived from the MC stochastic process of the isolated particle. We first obtain a MC unit of time from the relaxation of the system at fixed temperature. Then this unit of time is used to compute complex susceptibilities. We show that it is now possible to match the TQMC results with actual experimental results regarding frequency dependent in phase susceptibilities and quantify the unit of time in seconds. Finally we show that the time unit obtained for the isolated particle remains valid when considering interacting particles such as the Heisenberg coupling or dipole dipole interactions.</p>

            <p>The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explorations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four dimensional (4D) QHE has been experimentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</p>

The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$. We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experimental data. Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai Han, Fanlong Meng</p>
            <p>Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling. We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived. Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system. Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</p>

            <h2>Approximate calculation of multidimensional first passage times</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James F. Lutsko</p>
            <p>The general, multidimensional barrier crossing problem for diffusive processes under the action of conservative forces is studied with the goal of developing tractable approximations. Particular attention is given to the effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the large-barrier limit.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Chaos and Universal Trotterisation Behaviours in Digital Quantum Simulations</h2>

            <p>Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Observable criterion for collective entanglement in Boson-lattice system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehmet Emre Tasgin, Hyunchul Nha</p>
            <p>An optical lattice with cold trapped atoms represents a quantum system of fundamental importance as it enables the study of quantum many-body system in a controllable way. It is thus necessary to develop theoretical and experimental tools to explore quantum correlation in such systems to advance our understanding of many-body physics. While previous works have identified some profound aspects of quantum entanglement using e.g. entanglement entropy, there exists a critical demand to have an experimentally accessible tool to investigate many-body quantum entanglement in a broad context. We present an entanglement criterion characterizing collective entanglement in Boson lattice systems and enabling experimental observation readily. On applying our approach to the extended Bose-Hubbard model, we show that our criterion witnesses phase transitions such as Mott insulator--superfluid and Mott insulator--charge density wave transitions. Remarkably, it also makes it possible to detect multipartite entanglement among boson lattice sites in a rigorous sense. Our criterion can be experimentally tested via Raman scattering or time-of-flight methods, which are within the reach of current technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiuci Xu</p>
            <p>It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rathindra Nath Das, Takato Mori</p>
            <p>In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, 8-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensemble, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</p>

            <p>In this paper we study transitions of atoms between energy levels of several number-theory-inspired atom potentials, under the effect of time-dependent perturbations. First, we simulate in detail the case of a trap whose one-particle spectrum is given by prime numbers. We investigate one-body Rabi oscillations and the excitation lineshape for two resonantly coupled energy levels. We also show that techniques from quantum control are effective in reducing the transition time, compared to the case of a periodic perturbation. Next, we investigate cascades of such transitions. To this end, we pose the following question: can one construct a quantum system where the existence of a continuous resonant cascade is predicted on the validity of a particular statement in number theory? We find that a one-body trap with a log-natural spectrum, parametrically driven with a perturbation of a log-natural frequency, provides such a quantum system. Here, powers of a given natural number will form a ladder of equidistant energy levels; absence of gaps in this ladder is an indication of the validity of the number theory statement in question. Ideas for two more resonance cascade experiments are presented as well: they are designed to illustrate the validity of the Diophantus-Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity (the set of sums of two squares of integers is closed under multiplication) and the validity of the Goldbach conjecture (every even number is a sum of two primes).</p>

            <p>We use the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to derive a quantum master equation for a system weakly coupled to a chaotic finite-sized bath prepared in a pure state. We show that the emergence of Markovianity is controlled by the spectral function of the ETH and that local detailed balance emerges in the Markovian regime for a broad class of pure bath states. We numerically verify this result by comparing the master equation to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization of a chaotic Hamiltonian. We also compare the master equation to exact dynamics for an integrable bath and find that at finite size they strongly disagree. Our work puts forward eigenstate thermalization as a foundation for open quantum systems theory, thus extending it beyond ensemble bath preparations to chaotic many-body environments in generic pure states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Fan Cai, Yu-Chun Wang, Yu-Ran Zhang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</p>

            <p>We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng-Li Lin, Jhh-Jing Hong, Ching-Yu Huang</p>
            <p>We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</p>

            <p>Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant locality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while the older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes-highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.</p>

By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.</p>

We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.</p>

The Bardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon is also analysed at next-to-leading order, and we demonstrate that it disappears without breaking the scale invariance spontaneously.

            <p>Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a one-dimensional single layer placed in the middle of an optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation field. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multiple layers of two-dimensional materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a bright layer description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics in three dimensions. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayered material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</p>

            <h2>Noise equals control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric De Giuli</p>
            <p>Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</p>

            <p>We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom detection fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition.

            <h2>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez</p>
            <p>In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

            <h2>Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang</p>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form $(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially random Yukawa and QED-type interaction with external vector exhaust the class of random couplings capable of producing linear resistivity.</p>

            <h2>Statistical regimes of electromagnetic wave propagation in randomly time-varying media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seulong Kim, Kihong Kim</p>
            <p>Wave propagation in time-varying media enables unique control of energy transport by breaking energy conservation through temporal modulation. Among the resulting phenomena, temporal disorder-random fluctuations in material parameters-can suppress propagation and induce localization, analogous to Anderson localization. However, the statistical nature of this process remains incompletely understood. We present a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of electromagnetic wave propagation in spatially uniform media with randomly time-varying permittivity. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact moment equations and identify three distinct statistical regimes for initially unidirectional input: gamma-distributed energy at early times, negative exponential statistics at intermediate times, and a quasi-log-normal distribution at long times, distinct from the true log-normal. In contrast, symmetric bidirectional input yields genuine log-normal statistics across all time scales. These findings are validated using two complementary disorder models--delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant fluctuations--demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and governed by input symmetry. Momentum conservation constrains the long-time behavior, linking the statistical outcome to the initial conditions. Our results establish a unified framework for understanding statistical wave dynamics in time-modulated systems and offer guiding principles for the design of dynamically tunable photonic and electromagnetic devices.</p>

            <h2>Topological edge states and disorder robustness in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ba Phi Nguyen, Kihong Kim</p>
            <p>We investigate topological edge states in one-dimensional off-diagonal mosaic lattices, where nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes are modulated periodically with period $\kappa>1$. Analytically, we demonstrate that discrete edge states emerge at energy levels $E=\epsilon+2t\cos(\pi i/\kappa)$ ($i=1,\cdots,\kappa-1$), extending the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to multi-band systems. Numerical simulations show that these edge states are robustly localized and display characteristic nodal structures, with their existence being strongly dictated by the specific edge arrangement of long and short bonds. We further examine their stability under off-diagonal disorder, where the hopping amplitudes $\beta$ fluctuate randomly at intervals of $\kappa$. Using the inverse participation ratio as a localization measure, we show that these topological edge states remain robust over a broad range of disorder strengths. In contrast, additional $\beta$-dependent edge states that appear for $\kappa \ge 4$ are fragile and vanish even under relatively weak disorder. These findings highlight a rich interplay between topology, periodic modulation, and disorder, offering insights for engineering multi-gap topological phases and their realization in synthetic quantum and photonic systems.</p>

            <p>Direct ptychography enables the retrieval of information encoded in the phase of an electron wave passing through a thin sample by deconvolving the interference effects of a converged probe with known aberrations. Under the weak phase object approximation, this permits the optimal transfer of information using non-iterative techniques. However, the achievable resolution of the technique is traditionally limited by the probe step size -- setting stringent Nyquist sampling requirements. At the same time, parallax imaging has emerged as a dose-efficient phase-retrieval technique which relaxes sampling requirements and enables scan-upsampling. Here, we formulate parallax imaging as a quadratic approximation to part of the direct ptychography kernel and use this insight to enable upsampling in direct ptychography. We validate our analytical results numerically using simulated and experimental reconstructions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Varnavides, Julie Marie Bekkevold, Stephanie M Ribet, Mary C Scott, Lewys Jones, Colin Ophus</p>
            <p>The contrast transfer function (CTF) is widely used to evaluate phase retrieval methods in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), including center-of-mass imaging, parallax imaging, direct ptychography, and iterative ptychography. However, the CTF reflects only the maximum usable signal, neglecting the effects of finite electron fluence and the Poisson-limited nature of detection. As a result, it can significantly overestimate practical performance, especially in low-dose regimes. Here, we employ the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR), as a dose-aware statistical framework to evaluate the recoverable signal as a function of spatial frequency. Using numerical reconstructions of white-noise objects, we show that center-of-mass, parallax, and direct ptychography exhibit dose-independent SSNRs, with close-form analytic expressions. In contrast, iterative ptychography exhibits a surprising dose dependence: at low fluence, its SSNR converges to that of direct ptychography; at high fluence, it saturates at a value consistent with the maximum detective quantum efficiency predicted by recent quantum Fisher information bounds. The results highlight the limitations of CTF-based evaluation and motivate SSNR as a more accurate, dose-aware metric for assessing STEM phase retrieval methods.</p>

The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic Rényi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyda Elife Gönül, Huriye Gürsel</p>
            <p>In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power and a linkage between higher-dimensional field theory and transport phenomena is proposed. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-Møller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range. The construction is gauge invariant, behaves consistently under limiting conditions, and can be matched to experimental stopping data through a single effective normalization constant.</p>

            <p>Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is fundamental for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 053401 (2024)], we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach [Phys. Rev. A 101, 053416 (2020)], which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice shifts and find relative frequency deviations up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.</p>

            <p>The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</p>

            <h2>Coupling of radial multiple SLE with Gaussian free field, and the hydrodynamic limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Katori, Shinji Koshida, Chizuru Soukejima, Raian Suzuki</p>
            <p>Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) has been one of the central topics in the probabilistic study of two-dimensional critical systems. It is a random curve in two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is supposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for SLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected domain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial, a random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point. Multiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random curves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster interfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple SLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE. We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple SLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been extensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many recent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF occurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motions. The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic log-gases. This fact motivates us to study the hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding radial multiple SLE, which refers to the dynamical law of large numbers, when the number of curves tends to infinity. In our other main result, we provide explicit description of the hydrodynamic limit.</p>

This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.</p>

            <p>Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</p>

            <p>We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</p>

            <p>X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.</p>

            <p>The realization of quantum transport effects at elevated temperatures has long intrigued researchers due to the implications for unveiling novel physics and developing quantum devices. In this work, we report remarkable quantum linear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high temperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high fields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first Landau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau quantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority carriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity, allowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between the LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR originates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit, firstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago. This study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals an innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR, fundamentally distinct from previous findings. Our results bridge a gap in the understanding of phonon-mediated quantum-limit physics and establish strong magnetic fields at high temperatures as a promising platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p>We obtain moire quasicrystal patterns via Floquet-engineering intralayer-atomic interactions in twisted bilayer hexagonal optical lattices of ultracold atoms. By tracking the density wave amplitude, we partition the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes of each stage in both real and momentum space. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is intimately tied to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude will facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Most notably, at specific parameters, a twelve-fold (D12) moire quasicrystal pattern emerges which closely resembles that observed in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space patterns likewise exhibit pronounced rotational symmetry, with those in real space showing good agreement at specific instants. The patterns obtained exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting that this frequency-dependent pattern formation could be exploited for quantum precision measurement. Our findings introduce a new paradigm for investigating the quasicrystals and their associated symmetries in ultracold atomic system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kiryl Pakrouski, K. V. Samokhin</p>
            <p>Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</p>

            <h2>Displacement-Field-Driven Transition between Superconductivity and Valley Ferromagnetism in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeok-Jun Yang, Yi-Ting Hsu</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have observed transitions between superconductivity and correlated magnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ near van-Hove fillings, driven by the displacement field $D$. Motivated by the experiment, we theoretically propose a general mechanism for a $D$-controlled transition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit-coupled hexagonal systems, where van Hove singularities (VHS) lie on the Fermi level. We show that such a transition can be naturally captured by a simple VHS-only model without Fermi surface details, where the inter-VHS interactions that govern the Fermi surface instabilities is controlled by $D$ through the band projection of screened Coulomb interaction. By treating this simple model with renormalization group technique beyond mean-field level, we find that a chiral $d/p$-wave superconductivity naturally dominates under a weak displacement field $D<D_c$. At a stronger displacement field $D>D_c$, a \textit{valley ferromagnetic phase} (vFM) takes over, which is spatially non-uniform due to valley-modulated magnetization. Finally, we discuss generic conditions for the predicted superconductivity-to-ferromagnetism transition to take place in the rich family of few-layer hexagonal van der Waals material systems. Taking twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a case study, we discuss experimental detections that can falsify our prediction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoyu Han, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Qiang Gao, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</p>

            <h2>Anyon polarons as a window into the competing phases of the Kitaev-Gamma-Gamma' model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuan Chen, Inti Sodemann Villadiego</p>
            <p>We investigate the dispersions of anyon quasi-particles in the Kitaev honeycomb spin-liquid perturbed by $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings in order to understand phase transitions into competing states through anyon gap-closing instabilities. We demonstrate how anyon gap closings allow to understand phase transitions into a plethora of previously identified competing phases -- including zigzag, stripy, $120^\circ$, and incommensurate spiral phases -- and are in agreement with numerical studies not only on the nature of the phases, but also on the specific critical values of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings. Remarkably, when the anti-ferromagnetic Kitaev model is perturbed by an ferromagnetic $\Gamma$ interaction, we find that the single-vison and fermion gaps remain open while the gap of a magnon-like local boson vanishes, implying that the resulting state has coexistence of a spontaneous broken symmetry and the fractionalization pattern of the Kitaev spin liquid. The magnetic long-range order could be either a stripy antiferromagnet or an incommensurate spiral, depending on the sign of $\Gamma'$.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Co, Fe, and Ni Reference Layers for Single-Pulse All-Optical Reversal in Ferromagnetic Spin Valves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-Xiao Lin, Yann Le Guen, Julius Hohlfeld, Jon Gorchon, Grégory Malinowski, Stéphane Mangin, Daniel Lacour, Thomas Hauet, Michel Hehn</p>
            <p>We investigate the magnetization reversal process induced by a single femtosecond laser pulse in ferromagnetic spin valves by systematically comparing reference layers composed of pure Co, Ni, and Fe. To circumvent the loss of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy associated with changes in reference layer material and thickness, we design spin valves with in plane magnetizations. While antiparallel to parallel switching is observed for all three elements, parallel to antiparallel switching occurs only with a Co reference layer and is absent with Ni and Fe. This difference is attributed to the distinct ultrafast magnetization dynamics of the reference materials. Our results support the hypothesis that parallel to antiparallel switching requires a rapid remagnetization of the reference layer, which generates a substantial negative spin current polarized opposite to the free layer magnetization an essential condition for triggering its reversal.</p>

This approach enables the evaluation of angular-momentum-resolved electron-phonon matrix elements and McMillan-Hopfield parameters of not only elemental transition metals but also their compounds. The results are benchmarked against full-potential linearized augmented plane wave calculations, showing excellent agreement. We further outline a practical route to extract atom- and symmetry-type-resolved electron-phonon coupling constants. By enabling the use of RMTA descriptors within high-throughput workflows, this framework significantly lowers the computational cost of screening candidate superconductors, providing a valuable tool for materials discovery.</p>

            <h2>Correlation tuned Fermi-arc topology in a Weyl ferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiran Peng, Rui Liu, Pengyu Zheng, Zhiping Yin</p>
            <p>Electrons on Fermi arcs (FAs), a hallmark of Weyl semimetals, exhibit chiral transport harboring chiral anomaly, negative magnetoresistance, and Majorana zero modes. While FAs were observed in exemplary Weyl semimetal TaAs and Co3Sn2S2, the manipulation of FAs has been rarely explored. Here we take Co3Sn2S2 as an example and demonstrate that tuning the electronic correlation strength is an effective way to control the topology and connectivity of FAs. After achieving a good agreement with experimentally measured band structure by employing combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we show that the experimental charge dynamics are well reproduced by DFT+DMFT calculations but not DFT calculations. Electronic correlation renormalizes the bands around the Fermi level and modifies the energy and location of Weyl points, and the resulting FAs. In particular, on the Co-terminated surface, the FAs are formed by connecting Weyl points located in adjacent Brillouin zones in DFT+DMFT calculations and experiments, in strong contrast to the FAs connecting Weyl points within the same Brillouin zone in DFT calculations. We further show the evolution of FAs with correlation and reveal a topological change of the FAs on the Sn-terminated surface at stronger correlation strength. Our study sheds new light on experimental manipulation of FAs to improve the electronic properties of correlated Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p>Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at $E_F$ in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]$^{2+}$: 2e-. In this system, excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The flat bands and other dispersive bands observed in ARPES find excellent agreement with first-principles calculations, and theoretical analysis reveals that the near-$E_F$ electronic structure is well captured by a simple dice-lattice model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in conventional crystalline systems.</p>

            <h2>Electronic correlations in magnetized helical edge states coupled to s-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeinab Bakhshipour, Mir Vahid Hosseini</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the role of electron-electron interactions in one-dimensional magnetized helical states coupled to an s-wave superconductor. We consider a partially mixed helical (superhelical) regime, where the magnetic field (superconductivity) has a dominant contribution. Using bosonization and renormalization group techniques, it is shown how the interactions affect the correlation functions in the system. In the partially mixed helical regime, we find that superconducting pairing promotes spin-density-wave correlations, while singlet and triplet pairing correlations suppress, especially under attractive interactions. In contrast, in the superhelical regime, a perturbative Zeeman field enhances both spin singlet and spin triplet-x pairings under repulsive interactions. We calculate both logarithmic and residual corrections to charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and pairing correlations, revealing short- and long-range behaviors. We further investigate spin transport properties supplemented by a renormalization group analysis of the temperature and frequency dependence of spin conductivity. We also analyze the transport of momentum-spin-locked carriers in the presence of Zeeman-induced and pairing-induced gaps, uncovering the effect of interactions and the interplay between the two gaps in helical systems.</p>

            <p>The precise understanding of adsorption energetics and molecular geometry at catalytic sites is fundamental for advancing catalysis, particularly under the constraints of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study benchmarks the performance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations against diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for adsorption properties of small gas molecules relevant to CO oxidation -- namely O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, and atomic oxygen -- on a single Pt atom supported by pristine graphene. Our findings reveal that DMC calculations provide a significantly different landscape of adsorption energetics compared to DFT results. Notably, DFT predicts different lowest-energy configurations and spin states, particularly for O$_2$, which suggests potential discrepancies in predicting the catalytic behavior. Furthermore, this study identifies the critical issue of CO poisoning, highlighted by the large disparity between the DMC adsorption energies of O$_2$ ($-1.23(2)$ eV) and CO ($-3.37(1)$ eV), which can inhibit the catalytic process. These results emphasize the necessity for more sophisticated computational approaches in catalysis research, aiming to refine the prediction accuracy of reaction mechanisms and to enhance the design of more effective catalysts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Liang Guo, Xiao-Hong Pan, Hao Dong, Xin Liu</p>
            <p>The Josephson diode effect (JDE), a nonreciprocal supercurrent, is a cornerstone for future dissipationless electronics, yet achieving high efficiency in a simple device architecture remains a significant challenge. Here, we theoretically investigate the JDE in a junction based on monolayer 1T'-WTe$_2$. We first establish that different edge terminations of a WTe$_2$ nanoribbon lead to diverse electronic band structures, some of which host asymmetric edge states even with crystallographically equivalent terminations. This intrinsic asymmetry provides a natural platform for realizing the JDE. With a WTe$_2$-based Josephson junction, we demonstrate a significant JDE arising purely from these asymmetric edges when time-reversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic flux. While the efficiency of this edge-state-driven JDE is inherently limited, we discover a crucial mechanism for its enhancement: by tuning the chemical potential into the bulk bands, the interplay between edge and bulk transport channels boosts the maximum diode efficiency more than $50\%$. Furthermore, we show that this enhanced JDE is robust against moderate edge disorder. Our findings not only propose a novel route to achieve a highly efficient JDE using intrinsic material properties but also highlight the potential of engineered WTe$_2$ systems for developing advanced superconducting quantum devices.</p>

Using a Landau-Zener protocol, we show how local control of the field on one edge of the chain, implemented for instance with a spin-polarized scanning tunnel microscope tip, can adiabatically switch the magnetization direction on the other side of the chain.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) layered magnetic materials (LMMs) are a newly emerging class of van der Waals materials, opening new opportunities to study magneto-excitonic coupling. The air-stable, structurally and optically anisotropic A-type antiferromagnetic chromium sulfur bromide (CrSBr) is one of the most prominent examples of such LMMs. We investigate photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation of mono- to tri-layers CrSBr and find that it exhibits a unique duplexity, supporting both Frenkel- and Wannier-Mott-like excitons. Our magneto-optical experiments reveal a similar excitonic response from the mono- and trilayer systems and a completely different signature in the bilayer flake. This shows a different origin of the low-lying excitonic species (A, A', and B) in the band structure. We confirm the robustness of the magneto-excitonic coupling in few-layer CrSBr. Our work enables a more comprehensive exploration of the dual excitonic behavior in 2D materials.</p>

            <p>Odd-parity magnetism constitutes an intriguing phase of matter which breaks inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that the Fe-based superconductors exhibiting coplanar magnetic order realize an odd-parity magnetic state by combining low-energy modeling with density-functional theory. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the electronic spins are polarized along the $k_z$-direction and the splitting of the up and down states exhibits an $h$-wave form-factor. The magnitude of the splitting depends sensitively on specific parameters of the low-energy model, including specific out-of-plane hopping parameters and the Fermi energies of the hole- and electron-pockets. Interestingly, despite this state breaking inversion symmetry and exhibiting a finite out-of-plane Berry curvature and non-linear anomalous Hall effect, the Edelstein effect vanishes. Incorporating spin-orbit coupling tilts the momentum-space electronic spins into the ($k_x,k_y$)-plane and imparts finite in-plane components to the Edelstein response. Our findings highlight the Fe-based superconductors as platforms for exploring odd-parity magnetism both on its own and coexisting with unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p>For large-scale deployment and use of polymer electrolyte fuel cells, high-performance electrocatalysts with low platinum consumption are desirable. One promising strategy to meet this demand is to explore alternative materials that retain catalytic efficiency while introducing new mechanisms for performance enhacement. In this study, we investigate a ferromagnetic CoPt as a candidate material to accelerate oxygen reduction reactions. By using density functional theory calculations, we find the spin-polarized Co-$d$ states to enhance O$_2$ surface bonding due to local exchange splitting of Co-$d$ carriers at the Fermi level. Furthermore, O and O$_2$ adsorption and dissociation energies are found to be tuned by varying the thickness of the Pt layers. Our study gives insight into the role magnetism plays in the oxygen reduction reaction process and how magnetic ions may aid in the design of new advanced catalysts.</p>

            <h2>Bright yet dark: how strong coupling quenches exciton-polariton radiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxun Song, Li He, Bo Zhen</p>
            <p>Understanding the radiative decay of exciton-polaritons is essential for achieving long-lived polaritons - a key prerequisite for enhancing nonlinear and quantum polaritonic effects. However, conventional wisdom - the coupled oscillator model - often oversimplifies polariton radiation as independent emissions from uncoupled excitonic and photonic resonances, overlooking the role of strong exciton-photon coupling in reshaping their radiative behavior. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that goes beyond the conventional coupled oscillator model by fully accounting for the collective and coherent nature of exciton-photon interactions. We demonstrate that these interactions can strongly suppress polariton radiation via destructive interference - both within the excitonic ensemble and between excitonic and photonic radiation channels - giving rise to polaritonic bound states in the continuum with infinitely long radiative lifetimes. Our approach offers a unified description of polariton radiative decay and establishes new design principles for engineering long-lived exciton-polaritons with tailored radiation properties, opening new avenues for nonlinear, topological, and quantum polaritonic applications.</p>

Yet, translating these advancements to nonlinear mechanical systems remains an open challenge. Here, we present a new approach to nonlinear mechanical cloaking that frames cloaking as an optimization problem aimed at replicating a target mechanical response. We solve this problem using a differentiable simulation framework coupled with gradient-based optimization. We implement this approach in a class of mechanical metamaterials constructed from rigid units with elastic couplings that support large deformation and contact interactions. Using both numerical simulations and physical experiments, we design optimal cloak structures that effectively mask internal inhomogeneities and shield against external mechanical disturbances both in static and dynamic regimes. This approach provides a versatile design paradigm for creating mechanical systems with integrated cloaking functionality across a broad range of loading scenarios.</p>

            <p>Understanding strongly correlated systems is essential for advancing quantum chemistry and materials science, yet conventional methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) often fail to capture their complex electronic behavior. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates Multiconfigurational Self Consistent Field (MCSCF) with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our initial benchmarks on water dissociation enabled the systematic optimization of key computational parameters, including ansatz selection, active space construction, and error mitigation. Building on this, we extend our approach to investigate the interactions between graphene analogues and water, demonstrating that our framework produces binding energies consistent with high accuracy quantum methods. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to predict the binding energies of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) on both pristine and defective graphene analogues, revealing strong charge transfer effects and pronounced multireference character phenomena often misrepresented by standard DFT. In contrast to many existing quantum algorithms that are constrained to small molecular systems, our framework achieves chemically accurate predictions for larger, strongly correlated systems such as metal graphene complexes. This advancement highlights the capacity of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to address complex electronic interactions and demonstrates a practical route toward realizing quantum advantage for real world materials applications in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Hu, Enrico Rossi, Yafis Barlas</p>
            <p>Inversion asymmetry in bilayer graphene can be tuned by the displacement field. As a result, the band dispersion in biased bilayer graphene acquires flat band regions near the Dirac points along with a non-trivial band geometry. We analyze the effect of inversion symmetry on the critical temperature and superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state of AB-stacked graphene bilayer and on the exciton condensate in double layers formed by two AB-stacked graphene bilayers. The geometric superfluid stiffness in bilayer graphene superconductors is found to be negligible due to the small superconducting gap. Furthermore, we show that the geometric superfluid stiffness is maximized for a constant order parameter. Therefore, it can be neglected in biased bilayer graphene superconductors with any pairing symmetry. However, the displacement field enhances the geometric superfluid stiffness in exciton condensates. It is most prominent at low densities and high displacement fields. A consequence of the geometric superfluid stiffness is a modest enhancement of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature in bilayer graphene's exciton condensate.</p>

            <h2>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamran Behnia</p>
            <p>In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</p>

            <p>The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in nonlinear capacitors or classical time crystals) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. There occurs a dissipative phase transition from a nonconvex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. Our approach thus resolves apparent inconsistencies and provides computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.</p>

            <p>Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>The realization of quantum transport effects at elevated temperatures has long intrigued researchers due to the implications for unveiling novel physics and developing quantum devices. In this work, we report remarkable quantum linear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high temperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high fields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first Landau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau quantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority carriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity, allowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between the LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR originates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit, firstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago. This study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals an innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR, fundamentally distinct from previous findings. Our results bridge a gap in the understanding of phonon-mediated quantum-limit physics and establish strong magnetic fields at high temperatures as a promising platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena.</p>

            <p>We obtain moire quasicrystal patterns via Floquet-engineering intralayer-atomic interactions in twisted bilayer hexagonal optical lattices of ultracold atoms. By tracking the density wave amplitude, we partition the dynamical evolution into four distinct stages and verify the pattern changes of each stage in both real and momentum space. The spatial symmetry of the patterns is intimately tied to the modulation amplitudes and frequencies. Consequently, appropriately reducing the modulation frequency and increasing the amplitude will facilitate lattice symmetry breaking and the subsequent emergence of rotational symmetry. Most notably, at specific parameters, a twelve-fold (D12) moire quasicrystal pattern emerges which closely resembles that observed in twisted bilayer graphene. The momentum-space patterns likewise exhibit pronounced rotational symmetry, with those in real space showing good agreement at specific instants. The patterns obtained exhibit remarkable sensitivity to the modulation frequency, suggesting that this frequency-dependent pattern formation could be exploited for quantum precision measurement. Our findings introduce a new paradigm for investigating the quasicrystals and their associated symmetries in ultracold atomic system.</p>

            <p>Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary. Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.</p>

            <h2>Displacement-Field-Driven Transition between Superconductivity and Valley Ferromagnetism in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeok-Jun Yang, Yi-Ting Hsu</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have observed transitions between superconductivity and correlated magnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ near van-Hove fillings, driven by the displacement field $D$. Motivated by the experiment, we theoretically propose a general mechanism for a $D$-controlled transition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit-coupled hexagonal systems, where van Hove singularities (VHS) lie on the Fermi level. We show that such a transition can be naturally captured by a simple VHS-only model without Fermi surface details, where the inter-VHS interactions that govern the Fermi surface instabilities is controlled by $D$ through the band projection of screened Coulomb interaction. By treating this simple model with renormalization group technique beyond mean-field level, we find that a chiral $d/p$-wave superconductivity naturally dominates under a weak displacement field $D<D_c$. At a stronger displacement field $D>D_c$, a \textit{valley ferromagnetic phase} (vFM) takes over, which is spatially non-uniform due to valley-modulated magnetization. Finally, we discuss generic conditions for the predicted superconductivity-to-ferromagnetism transition to take place in the rich family of few-layer hexagonal van der Waals material systems. Taking twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a case study, we discuss experimental detections that can falsify our prediction.</p>

            <h2>Exact models of chiral flat-band superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoyu Han, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Qiang Gao, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuan Chen, Inti Sodemann Villadiego</p>
            <p>We investigate the dispersions of anyon quasi-particles in the Kitaev honeycomb spin-liquid perturbed by $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings in order to understand phase transitions into competing states through anyon gap-closing instabilities. We demonstrate how anyon gap closings allow to understand phase transitions into a plethora of previously identified competing phases -- including zigzag, stripy, $120^\circ$, and incommensurate spiral phases -- and are in agreement with numerical studies not only on the nature of the phases, but also on the specific critical values of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings. Remarkably, when the anti-ferromagnetic Kitaev model is perturbed by an ferromagnetic $\Gamma$ interaction, we find that the single-vison and fermion gaps remain open while the gap of a magnon-like local boson vanishes, implying that the resulting state has coexistence of a spontaneous broken symmetry and the fractionalization pattern of the Kitaev spin liquid. The magnetic long-range order could be either a stripy antiferromagnet or an incommensurate spiral, depending on the sign of $\Gamma'$.</p>

            <p>We investigate the magnetization reversal process induced by a single femtosecond laser pulse in ferromagnetic spin valves by systematically comparing reference layers composed of pure Co, Ni, and Fe. To circumvent the loss of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy associated with changes in reference layer material and thickness, we design spin valves with in plane magnetizations. While antiparallel to parallel switching is observed for all three elements, parallel to antiparallel switching occurs only with a Co reference layer and is absent with Ni and Fe. This difference is attributed to the distinct ultrafast magnetization dynamics of the reference materials. Our results support the hypothesis that parallel to antiparallel switching requires a rapid remagnetization of the reference layer, which generates a substantial negative spin current polarized opposite to the free layer magnetization an essential condition for triggering its reversal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiran Peng, Rui Liu, Pengyu Zheng, Zhiping Yin</p>
            <p>Electrons on Fermi arcs (FAs), a hallmark of Weyl semimetals, exhibit chiral transport harboring chiral anomaly, negative magnetoresistance, and Majorana zero modes. While FAs were observed in exemplary Weyl semimetal TaAs and Co3Sn2S2, the manipulation of FAs has been rarely explored. Here we take Co3Sn2S2 as an example and demonstrate that tuning the electronic correlation strength is an effective way to control the topology and connectivity of FAs. After achieving a good agreement with experimentally measured band structure by employing combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we show that the experimental charge dynamics are well reproduced by DFT+DMFT calculations but not DFT calculations. Electronic correlation renormalizes the bands around the Fermi level and modifies the energy and location of Weyl points, and the resulting FAs. In particular, on the Co-terminated surface, the FAs are formed by connecting Weyl points located in adjacent Brillouin zones in DFT+DMFT calculations and experiments, in strong contrast to the FAs connecting Weyl points within the same Brillouin zone in DFT calculations. We further show the evolution of FAs with correlation and reveal a topological change of the FAs on the Sn-terminated surface at stronger correlation strength. Our study sheds new light on experimental manipulation of FAs to improve the electronic properties of correlated Weyl semimetals.</p>

At low temperatures, however, the relaxation time exhibits a power-law divergence, $\tau\sim10\hbar/k_{\mathrm{B}}T$, signaling quantum critical behavior at the pseudogap end point doping.

            <p>Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at $E_F$ in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]$^{2+}$: 2e-. In this system, excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The flat bands and other dispersive bands observed in ARPES find excellent agreement with first-principles calculations, and theoretical analysis reveals that the near-$E_F$ electronic structure is well captured by a simple dice-lattice model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in conventional crystalline systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeinab Bakhshipour, Mir Vahid Hosseini</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the role of electron-electron interactions in one-dimensional magnetized helical states coupled to an s-wave superconductor. We consider a partially mixed helical (superhelical) regime, where the magnetic field (superconductivity) has a dominant contribution. Using bosonization and renormalization group techniques, it is shown how the interactions affect the correlation functions in the system. In the partially mixed helical regime, we find that superconducting pairing promotes spin-density-wave correlations, while singlet and triplet pairing correlations suppress, especially under attractive interactions. In contrast, in the superhelical regime, a perturbative Zeeman field enhances both spin singlet and spin triplet-x pairings under repulsive interactions. We calculate both logarithmic and residual corrections to charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and pairing correlations, revealing short- and long-range behaviors. We further investigate spin transport properties supplemented by a renormalization group analysis of the temperature and frequency dependence of spin conductivity. We also analyze the transport of momentum-spin-locked carriers in the presence of Zeeman-induced and pairing-induced gaps, uncovering the effect of interactions and the interplay between the two gaps in helical systems.</p>

            <p>The precise understanding of adsorption energetics and molecular geometry at catalytic sites is fundamental for advancing catalysis, particularly under the constraints of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study benchmarks the performance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations against diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for adsorption properties of small gas molecules relevant to CO oxidation -- namely O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, and atomic oxygen -- on a single Pt atom supported by pristine graphene. Our findings reveal that DMC calculations provide a significantly different landscape of adsorption energetics compared to DFT results. Notably, DFT predicts different lowest-energy configurations and spin states, particularly for O$_2$, which suggests potential discrepancies in predicting the catalytic behavior. Furthermore, this study identifies the critical issue of CO poisoning, highlighted by the large disparity between the DMC adsorption energies of O$_2$ ($-1.23(2)$ eV) and CO ($-3.37(1)$ eV), which can inhibit the catalytic process. These results emphasize the necessity for more sophisticated computational approaches in catalysis research, aiming to refine the prediction accuracy of reaction mechanisms and to enhance the design of more effective catalysts.</p>

            <p>The Josephson diode effect (JDE), a nonreciprocal supercurrent, is a cornerstone for future dissipationless electronics, yet achieving high efficiency in a simple device architecture remains a significant challenge. Here, we theoretically investigate the JDE in a junction based on monolayer 1T'-WTe$_2$. We first establish that different edge terminations of a WTe$_2$ nanoribbon lead to diverse electronic band structures, some of which host asymmetric edge states even with crystallographically equivalent terminations. This intrinsic asymmetry provides a natural platform for realizing the JDE. With a WTe$_2$-based Josephson junction, we demonstrate a significant JDE arising purely from these asymmetric edges when time-reversal symmetry is broken by a magnetic flux. While the efficiency of this edge-state-driven JDE is inherently limited, we discover a crucial mechanism for its enhancement: by tuning the chemical potential into the bulk bands, the interplay between edge and bulk transport channels boosts the maximum diode efficiency more than $50\%$. Furthermore, we show that this enhanced JDE is robust against moderate edge disorder. Our findings not only propose a novel route to achieve a highly efficient JDE using intrinsic material properties but also highlight the potential of engineered WTe$_2$ systems for developing advanced superconducting quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Odd-parity magnetism constitutes an intriguing phase of matter which breaks inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that the Fe-based superconductors exhibiting coplanar magnetic order realize an odd-parity magnetic state by combining low-energy modeling with density-functional theory. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the electronic spins are polarized along the $k_z$-direction and the splitting of the up and down states exhibits an $h$-wave form-factor. The magnitude of the splitting depends sensitively on specific parameters of the low-energy model, including specific out-of-plane hopping parameters and the Fermi energies of the hole- and electron-pockets. Interestingly, despite this state breaking inversion symmetry and exhibiting a finite out-of-plane Berry curvature and non-linear anomalous Hall effect, the Edelstein effect vanishes. Incorporating spin-orbit coupling tilts the momentum-space electronic spins into the ($k_x,k_y$)-plane and imparts finite in-plane components to the Edelstein response. Our findings highlight the Fe-based superconductors as platforms for exploring odd-parity magnetism both on its own and coexisting with unconventional superconductivity.</p>

One promising strategy to meet this demand is to explore alternative materials that retain catalytic efficiency while introducing new mechanisms for performance enhacement. In this study, we investigate a ferromagnetic CoPt as a candidate material to accelerate oxygen reduction reactions. By using density functional theory calculations, we find the spin-polarized Co-$d$ states to enhance O$_2$ surface bonding due to local exchange splitting of Co-$d$ carriers at the Fermi level. Furthermore, O and O$_2$ adsorption and dissociation energies are found to be tuned by varying the thickness of the Pt layers. Our study gives insight into the role magnetism plays in the oxygen reduction reaction process and how magnetic ions may aid in the design of new advanced catalysts.</p>

            <p>Understanding the radiative decay of exciton-polaritons is essential for achieving long-lived polaritons - a key prerequisite for enhancing nonlinear and quantum polaritonic effects. However, conventional wisdom - the coupled oscillator model - often oversimplifies polariton radiation as independent emissions from uncoupled excitonic and photonic resonances, overlooking the role of strong exciton-photon coupling in reshaping their radiative behavior. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that goes beyond the conventional coupled oscillator model by fully accounting for the collective and coherent nature of exciton-photon interactions. We demonstrate that these interactions can strongly suppress polariton radiation via destructive interference - both within the excitonic ensemble and between excitonic and photonic radiation channels - giving rise to polaritonic bound states in the continuum with infinitely long radiative lifetimes. Our approach offers a unified description of polariton radiative decay and establishes new design principles for engineering long-lived exciton-polaritons with tailored radiation properties, opening new avenues for nonlinear, topological, and quantum polaritonic applications.</p>

            <p>Understanding strongly correlated systems is essential for advancing quantum chemistry and materials science, yet conventional methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) often fail to capture their complex electronic behavior. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates Multiconfigurational Self Consistent Field (MCSCF) with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our initial benchmarks on water dissociation enabled the systematic optimization of key computational parameters, including ansatz selection, active space construction, and error mitigation. Building on this, we extend our approach to investigate the interactions between graphene analogues and water, demonstrating that our framework produces binding energies consistent with high accuracy quantum methods. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to predict the binding energies of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) on both pristine and defective graphene analogues, revealing strong charge transfer effects and pronounced multireference character phenomena often misrepresented by standard DFT. In contrast to many existing quantum algorithms that are constrained to small molecular systems, our framework achieves chemically accurate predictions for larger, strongly correlated systems such as metal graphene complexes. This advancement highlights the capacity of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to address complex electronic interactions and demonstrates a practical route toward realizing quantum advantage for real world materials applications in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</p>

We first apply this protocol to show spatial bunching and anti-bunching of two-photon NOON states in a one-dimensional lattice consisting of identical waveguides. In the case of the rhombic lattice, we show that for an even (odd) photon number $N$, localization occurs at $0 \, (\pi)$ phase of the NOON state with a probability of $2^{1-N}$.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang Hu, Enrico Rossi, Yafis Barlas</p>
            <p>Inversion asymmetry in bilayer graphene can be tuned by the displacement field. As a result, the band dispersion in biased bilayer graphene acquires flat band regions near the Dirac points along with a non-trivial band geometry. We analyze the effect of inversion symmetry on the critical temperature and superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state of AB-stacked graphene bilayer and on the exciton condensate in double layers formed by two AB-stacked graphene bilayers. The geometric superfluid stiffness in bilayer graphene superconductors is found to be negligible due to the small superconducting gap. Furthermore, we show that the geometric superfluid stiffness is maximized for a constant order parameter. Therefore, it can be neglected in biased bilayer graphene superconductors with any pairing symmetry. However, the displacement field enhances the geometric superfluid stiffness in exciton condensates. It is most prominent at low densities and high displacement fields. A consequence of the geometric superfluid stiffness is a modest enhancement of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature in bilayer graphene's exciton condensate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Höfling, Arthur V. Straube</p>
            <p>The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterized by an orientation-dependent (``multiplicative'') noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether Itō's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them in a top-down appraoch from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalization constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favorable prefactor of the discretization error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations based on projection on the constraining manifold. For torques originating from constant external fields, we prove by virtue of the Fokker-Planck equation that the constructed diffusion process satisfies detailed balance and converges to the correct equilibrium distribution. The analysis is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres, such as self-propelled Janus particles.</p>

            <p>Dipolar supersolids--quantum states that are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while their solid nature remain uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</p>

            <h2>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamran Behnia</p>
            <p>In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</p>

            <p>The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic energies (which appear, e.g., in nonlinear capacitors or classical time crystals) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the coupling strength to a dissipative environment. There occurs a dissipative phase transition from a nonconvex Hamiltonian to a convex Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. Our approach thus resolves apparent inconsistencies and provides computationally efficient methods to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.</p>

            <p>Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Qubit parametrization of the variational discrete action theory for the multiorbital Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengqian Cheng, Chris A. Marianetti</p>
            <p>The variational discrete action theory (VDAT) at \mathcal{N}=3 is a potent tool for accurately capturing Mott and Hund physics at zero temperature in d=\infty at a cost comparable to the Gutzwiller approximation, which is recovered by VDAT at \mathcal{N}=2. Here we develop a qubit parametrization of the gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital Hubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit parametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the variational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape of a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with dimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit parametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital Hubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor series expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how the Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of the SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical U_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression for U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical solution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with a special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit parametrization can also be applied to \mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and B-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave spin mean-field theory. The qubit parametrization not only improves the efficiency and transparency of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3, but also provides the key advances for the construction of a one-body reduced density matrix functional capable of capturing Mott and Hund physics.</p>

            <h2>Experimental observation of multimode quantum phase transitions in a superconducting Bose-Hubbard simulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudia Castillo-Moreno, Théo Sépulcre, Timo Hillmann, Kazi Rafsanjani Amin, Mikael Kervinen, Simone Gasparinetti</p>
            <p>The study of phase transitions and critical phenomena arising in quantum driven-dissipative systems, and whether a correspondence can be drawn to their equilibrium counterparts, is a pressing question in contemporary physics. The development of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental platform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a multi-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain consisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests itself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency or power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum through the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and construct the full phase diagram. We further perform time-dependent measurements of the switching between the two phases in the transition region, from which we corroborate the transition line and extract transition times ranging from a few ms up to 143~s. Our model, based on single-mode mean-field theory and cross-Kerr interactions, captures the features at moderate pump powers and quantitatively reproduces the transition line. Our results open a new window into non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and mark a step toward realizing and understanding dissipative phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit using superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Strong Raman Optical Activity and Chiral Phonons in Chiral Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites</h2>

            <p>Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with chiral organic cations are very interesting for optoelectronic applications because of their intrinsically chiral light-matter interactions. Chiral distortions in these materials lead to circular dichroism, circular birefringence, and circularly polarized luminescence in the band transitions of the inorganic sublattice. Raman-active vibrational modes in these crystals are governed by crystal symmetry and therefore are also strongly impacted by the nature and magnitude of the chiral distortions. Here, we report low-frequency Raman modes that are sensitive to circularly polarized excitation in chiral hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (CHOIPs) across a wide range of structures and compositions. The circularly polarized Raman spectra from enantiomers of CHOIP single crystals exhibit sharp modes below 150 cm-1, corresponding to vibrations of the lead iodide octahedra. These modes exhibit strong differences in intensities (Raman optical activity, ROA) depending on the handedness of the excitation, with high degree of polarization for several modes. Calculations reveal the presence of several chiral phonon modes with opposite phonon angular momenta. The strong ROA and the chiral phonon modes are a direct consequence of chirality transfer from the chiral organic linker to the lead iodide octahedra in the CHOIP structure, resulting in a strong chiroptical response in the phonon modes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin P. Bergfield</p>
            <p>Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $Büttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.</p>

            <h2>Bose-Einstein condensate of ultracold sodium-rubidium molecules with tunable dipolar interactions</h2>

            <p>Realizing Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules is a long-standing challenge in ultracold physics and quantum science due to near-universal two-body collisional losses. Here, we report the production of a Bose-Einstein condensate of ground-state sodium-rubidium molecules via high efficiency evaporative cooling, with losses suppressed using the dual microwave shielding technique. The ability to tune the dipolar interaction between these ultracold polar molecules is crucial for producing the condensate and enables exciting prospects for future applications. We explore different regimes of dipolar interactions, realizing both the gas phase and the quantum droplet phase of the molecular condensate. This work opens new avenues for investigating quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions and for quantum simulation of long-range many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Extensive entanglement between coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids in and out of equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taufiq Murtadho, Marek Gluza, Nelly H. Y. Ng</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics, hence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While entanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly more challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we theoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In particular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite temperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically calculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below which the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is accessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the vicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with mutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by the coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain generalized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization. Moreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale extensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement between coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is largely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of entanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium regimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive entanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.</p>

            <p>We present the synthesis and study of the magnetic and electronic properties of NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. The {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 interface hosts a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with large spin-orbit coupling, making it promising for spintronics applications if it can be coupled to a suitable source of spin currents. Here, we synthesize a ferrimagnetic insulating NiFe2O4(001) layer on {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) using a low-temperature reactive sputtering at 150 deg C without compromising the mobility and charge carrier density of the 2DEG at the {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) interface. The sheet resistance of both {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 and NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 exhibits metallic behavior down to cryogenic temperatures, with a low temperature upturn driven by the Kondo-like scattering. Most importantly, NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 behaves as a magnetic diode at low temperatures, and its rectification performance increases significantly with increasing magnetic field strength giving rise to a robust magneto-electronic rectification effect at low temperatures, which provides a first step towards the development of all-oxide heterostructures capable of efficient spin-charge conversion.</p>

            <p>Noncollinear antiferromagnets (NCAFs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for future spintronic technologies, offering ultrafast switching, negligible stray fields allowing dense packing, and robustness against external magnetic perturbations. When interfaced with ferromagnets (FMs), they can strongly influence interfacial exchange and spin-torque mechanisms that enable manipulating magnetic order and realizing functionalities beyond conventional heavy metals (HMs) based FM/HM heterostructures. Here, we perform a broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) study to systematically investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin-to-charge conversion in permalloy (Py) and Mn$_3$Pt bilayers. High-quality Py films provide a well-defined FMR spectra with a low Gilbert damping parameter ( $\alpha_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 9.8 \times 10^{-3}$). We observe a pronounced enhancement of damping with intrinsic value $\alpha_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-2}$ in the Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayer, indicating efficient spin pumping into the NCAF layer. Frequency dependent linewidth analysis shows a predominantly Gilbert type damping in the bilayers and the corresponding effective spin-mixing conductance ( $g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{18}$m$^{-2}$) is comparable to that of other high-performance antiferromagnetic heterostructures. These results are significant for establishing NCAFs as a candidate material for spin generation and highlights the potential of Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayers for efficient and ultrafast spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruobing Wang, Qiaoyu Tan, Yili Wang, Ying Wang, Xin Wang</p>
            <p>Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation. Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method, which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs. We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional and unconditional generation tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Fardelli, A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Wei Li</p>
            <p>We show how to construct a holographic effective theory for the leading-twist operators in the $O(2)$ model in the $4-d=\epsilon$ expansion up to $O(\epsilon^2)$, based on the separation of short-distance and long-distance effects that arises as a function of spin $J$. We obtain the Hamiltonian of the theory and show that it correctly reproduces all the dimensions at $O(\epsilon^2)$ of the leading twist operators for all values of the charge $Q$ and spin $J$. The holographic Hamiltonian is given by the bulk exchange of a charged scalar $\phi$, neutral scalar $s \sim \phi \phi^*$, and a `ghost' field $c$, as well as a single local bulk interaction $(\phi \phi^*)^2$. We analyze various aspects of the spectrum and discuss their interpretation in light of the bulk description.</p>

            <p>Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework, INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration), to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery; in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.</p>

            <p>We consider the Schelling-like social competition reflected in "dynamics of opinions" among groups of agents ("communities") in a highly transparent world. Specifically, we investigate a $q$-state Potts spin system with competing two- and three-body interactions on a complete graph. Agents interact through pairwise repulsion (opposing opinions) between different communities and three-body attraction (shared opinions) within the same community. In the thermodynamic limit, we identify variants of three key phases: (a) a symmetric "mixed" phase of $q$ states, in which no single opinion dominates in the society (interpreted as a "democracy"), (b) a symmetric "mixed" phase but of $q-1$ states, and (c) a "consensus" phase, characterized by the emergence of a dominant opinion (or "ideology"), coexisting with symmetrically distributed minority views. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal finite-size effects and metastable switching between configurations. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between our social model on a complete graph and the mean-field $SU(N)$ quantum spin system with both quadratic and cubic interactions, revealing a "social-quantum" duality. This duality provides new perspectives on both stratification of social communication, and quantum many-body phenomena, offering a unified framework for understanding emergent collective behavior in complex systems.</p>

            <p>While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</p>

            <p>A hallmark of certain topology, including the Chern number, is the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions in the bulk bands. Conversely, other types of topology do not necessarily impose Wannier obstructions. Remarkably, such Wannier-localizable topological insulators can host boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. In our accompanying Letter [D. Nakamura {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 096601 (2025), arXiv:2407.09458], we demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology underlies detachable boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors, thereby establishing their tenfold classification based on internal symmetry. Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship between Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary states. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic non-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable topological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the other hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of topological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the threefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the boundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this agreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary correspondence on the basis of $K$-theory.</p>

            <p>Pt-based electrocatalysts are the primary choice for fuel cells due to their superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. To enhance ORR performance and durability, extensive studies have investigated transition metal alloying, doping, and shape control to optimize the three key governing factors for ORR: geometry, local chemistry, and strain of their surface and subsurface. However, systematic optimization remains incomplete, as it requires an atomic-scale understanding of these factors and their dynamics over potential cycling, as well as their relationship to ORR activity. Here, we implement neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography to measure the 3D atomic structural dynamics and their effects on the functional degradation of PtNi alloy catalysts. Our results reveal that PtNi catalysts undergo shape changes, surface alloying, and strain relaxation during cycling, which can be effectively mitigated by Ga doping. By combining geometry, local chemistry, and strain analysis, we calculated the changes in ORR activity over thousands of cycles and observed that Ga doping leads to higher initial activity and greater stability. These findings offer a pathway to understanding 3D atomic structural dynamics and their relation to ORR activity during cycling, paving the way for the systematic design of durable, high-efficiency nanocatalysts.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheolhee Han, Nadav Katz, Eran Sela</p>
            <p>We consider a generic quantum many-body system initiated at thermal equilibrium and driven by an external parameter, and discuss the prospect for measuring the work done by the varying parameter on the system. While existing methods are based on a full control of the system's Hamiltonian and are thus limited to few-level quantum systems, measuring work in many-body quantum systems remains challenging. Our approach relies on transforming the external parameter into a dynamical ``work agent", for which we consider an harmonic oscillator in a semiclassical coherent state with a large photon number. We define a work generating function which coincides with the standard two-point measurement protocol for work measurement in the limit of a large photon number. While \emph{in principle} it allows to relate the moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ to observables of the work agent, we focus on the average work, which is obtained from energy conservation by the change of the energy of the agent, which can be measured using photon number detection. We illustrate this concept on a transmon-microcavity system, which displays various quantum coherent effects including Landau-Zener Stükelberg interference and collapse and revival of Rabi oscillations. We discuss how our setup allows to measure work in a variety of quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct an array of spin singlet and/or triplet qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings describe a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits and therefore provide a platform for performing many-body quantum simulations on spin excitations like magnons and triplons.</p>

            <p>Antiferroelectricity (AFE) is a fundamental concept in physics and materials science. Conventional AFEs have the picture of alternating local electric dipoles defined in real space. Here, we discover a new class of AFEs, termed type-II AFEs, which possess opposite polarizations defined in momentum space across a pair of symmetry decoupled subspaces. Unlike conventional AFEs, the order parameter of type-II AFEs is rigorously formulated through Berry-phase theory and can be quantitatively extracted from the electronic band structure. Focusing on a subclass of type-II AFEs that preserve spin-rotation symmetry, we establish the relevant symmetry constraints and identify all compatible spin point groups. Remarkably, we find that type-II AFE order intrinsically coexists with antiferromagnetism, revealing a robust form of magnetoelectric coupling. We construct an altermagnetic model and identify several concrete antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic materials, such as FeS, Cr2O3, MgMnO3, monolayer MoICl2 and bilayer CrI3, that exhibit this novel ordering. Furthermore, we uncover unique physical phenomena associated with type-II spin-AFE systems, including spin current generation upon AFE switching and localized spin polarization at boundaries and domain walls. Our findings reveal a previously hidden class of quantum materials with intertwined ferroic orders, offering exciting opportunities for both fundamental exploration and technological applications.</p>

            <p>The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state. In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions, formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows within a given approximation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahnam Gorgi Zadeh, Alberto Ghirri, Sergio Pagano, Simone Tocci, Claudio Gatti, Antonio Cassinese</p>
            <p>The use of high-quality factor resonators is of undoubted interest for high-precision measurements and for applications in quantum technologies. Novel types of microwave sensors can be realized by coupling a first resonator acting as a stable frequency reference with a second resonator that is sensitive to a particular physical quantity. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$ factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) SrTiO$_3$ puck, whose resonant frequency varies as a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity that reaches values higher than 30000 below 1 K. Extensive electromagnetic simulations are used to test different coupling configurations, showing great versatility in tuning the coupling in the weak or strong regime, depending on the puck's position within the cavity. Moreover, for the coupled system, they allow investigation of the dependence of the zero transmission frequency (notch frequency) on changes in permittivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, obtaining a maximum value of 2.8 MHz per unit change of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. Finally, we discuss the use of the coupled system as a sensor that operates in different temperature ranges.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamic principles governing energy and information are important tools for a deeper understanding and better control of quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally investigate the interplay of the thermodynamic costs and information flow in a quantum system undergoing iterative quantum measurement and feedback. Our study employs a state stabilization protocol involving repeated measurement and feedback on an electronic spin qubit associated with a Silicon-Vacancy center in diamond, which is strongly coupled to a diamond nanocavity. This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback's causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol. Our work lays the foundation for investigating the entropic and energetic costs of real-time quantum control in various quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric D. Schultz, Keiichiro Furuya, Laimei Nie</p>
            <p>As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.</p>

            <p>Incorporating group symmetries into neural networks has been a cornerstone of success in many AI-for-science applications. Diagonal groups of isometries, which describe the invariance under a simultaneous movement of multiple objects, arise naturally in many-body quantum problems. Despite their importance, diagonal groups have received relatively little attention, as they lack a natural choice of invariant maps except in special cases. We study different ways of incorporating diagonal invariance in neural network ansätze trained via variational Monte Carlo methods, and consider specifically data augmentation, group averaging and canonicalization. We show that, contrary to standard ML setups, in-training symmetrization destabilizes training and can lead to worse performance. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that this unexpected behavior may arise from a unique computational-statistical tradeoff not found in standard ML analyses of symmetrization. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that post hoc averaging is less sensitive to such tradeoffs and emerges as a simple, flexible and effective method for improving neural network solvers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Yu Zou, Bing-Bing Wang, Yong Ge, Ke-Qi Zhao, Yu-Qi Chen, Hong-Xiang Sun, Shou-Qi Yuan, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. A well-known example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non-Hermitian lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary-localized loss probability-a phenomenon that requires not only non-Hermitian band topology but also the closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the non-Hermitian edge burst in a classical-wave metamaterial: a lossy nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non-Hermitian band topology; the latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non-Hermitian band topology and other physical properties in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Natan Andrei</p>
            <p>We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases $\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment $\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$. These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with four Majorana zero modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Cayao, Masatoshi Sato</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors is $\varphi=\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights, thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions hosting Majorana zero modes.</p>

            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) has long struggled to treat light rare-earth magnetism. We show that this difficulty arises from an overestimate of the $4f$ charge asphericity, and thus the magnetic anisotropy energy, due to the inadequacy of single Slater-determinant representations. We propose an effective solution by combining constrained DFT+U with crystal field theory and a systematic many-body correction to the charge asphericity. We confirm the validity of this combination on TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and TbCo$_5$, and then show how the many-body correction adjusts the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy of SmCo$_5$ to match experiment. Our method is an efficient DFT-based approach to address light-rare-earth magnetism.</p>

            <p>Weyl semimetals and higher-order topological insulators represent two fundamental yet distinct classes of topological matter. While both have been extensively studied in classical-wave systems, their coexistence and controllable transition within a single platform remain largely unexplored. Meanwhile, implementing three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings, which is crucial for realizing a broad class of higher-dimensional topological phases, continues to pose significant experimental challenges. Here, we experimentally realize three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings and demonstrate that tuning the dimerized spin-orbit coupling strength enables both the coexistence of and a controllable switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases. By engineering a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial, we synthesize the required spin-orbit interactions and observe hallmark signatures of both phases: frequency spectroscopy reveals the Fermi arcs, while local density of states measurements identify the topological corner modes. Interestingly, the corner mode degeneracy doubles compared to that in the canonical Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, signaling an enriched topological structure. Our study establishes a fundamental connection between two paradigmatic topological phases and paves the way for further exploring spin-orbit-coupling induced exotic higher-dimensional topological phases.</p>

Highly efficient optical manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nanowatts per square micrometer. Utilizing this optically induced transition, we also demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of ferromagnetic domain walls.

            <p>Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</p>

The heterostructure itself acts as a Fabry-Pérot cavity, such that the photonic modes strongly couple to the cyclotron resonance to form Landau polaritons. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy reveals vacuum Rabi splitting larger than the mode spacing, resulting in a rich multi-mode polaritonic spectra which is accurately reproduced by an "all-to-all" multi-photonic, multi-electronic Hopfield coupling model. In addition, modeling of the electromagnetic field distribution inside the cavity reveals evidence of light-matter decoupling, even in the asymptotic limit of zero frequency. The system demonstrates a robust platform for exploring extreme coupling regimes and its chiral nature holds potential for chiral cavity and chiral mirror applications.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric quantities. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</p>

            <p>The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms.

            <p>Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism.</p>

            <p>Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance.

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a tunable platform for the realization of emergent phenomena in layered electron systems. While scanning probe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of surface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in multi-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures, states that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal detected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and interpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a glimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts the charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW heterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform layer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in double-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here the discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of microwaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases in the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane offers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative quantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we extract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap sizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes beneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and screening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that the uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a wide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from fractional Chern insulators in Moiré superlattices to correlated states in multilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.</p>

            <p>Chirality of spin waves offers an advantageous binary carrier for data transmission and processing with ultrafast dynamics and low power consumption. Altermagnets possess intrinsic chirality-splitting spin waves and vanishing net magnetization, thus emerging as ideal platforms to host chirality bits. However, active control of the chiral states remains a key challenge for realizing logic operations in chirality-based circuits. Here, we propose a novel scheme for reversibly switching spin-wave chirality in altermagnets between right- and left-handedness by tuning spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength. Specifically, for in-plane spin polarization, SOC hybridizes with the altermagnetism, which induces a momentum-dependent competition. The chirality-splitting structure of spin waves is dominated by either SOC or altermagnetism in different Brillouin zone regions, allowing chirality switching by altering their relative strength. An experimental design utilizing an antiferromagnetic substrate to induce SOC and a heavy-metal stripe for chirality detection is proposed. Our work establishes a novel pathway for controlling spin-wave chirality in altermagnets via SOC, laying the groundwork for developing spintronic devices utilizing switchable chiral spin waves as dynamic information carriers.</p>

            <p>Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron correlations, is a fascinating topic with broad scientific and technological impact. Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic polarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the CI/FCI states. Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical pumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e., electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable ferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature. Both optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective near CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of photo-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved measurements further demonstrate optical writing of a ferromagnetic, and thus a CI (or FCI) domain.

            <h2>Quantum geometry in low-energy linear and nonlinear optical responses of magnetic Rashba semiconductor (Ge,Mn)Te</h2>

            <p>Quantum geometry appears as a key factor in understanding the optical properties of quantum materials, with the anticipation on diverging or quantized responses near the Dirac and Weyl points. Here we investigate linear and nonlinear optical responses-optical conductivity and injection current- in a magnetic Rashba semiconductor in the mid-infrared region, with varying the Fermi energy across the Dirac point. We reveal that the linear optical conductivity reflects quantum metric, which remains finite irrespective of the diminishing joint density-of-states at lower photon energy. It is also confirmed that the magnetic injection current enhances depending on the energy of the Fermi level relative to the Dirac point. These optical spectra are nicely reproduced by our theoretical calculations with geometrical effects taken into account.</p>

            <p>Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies due to their ability to detect single photons with ultra-high efficiency, low dark counts and fast temporal resolution. Superconducting materials exhibiting high uniformity, large absorption cross-section and atomic-scale thickness are desirable to extend single-photon detection from the near-infrared up to the terahertz regime, where existing material choices are especially constrained. Substrate independence would further open the way to integrate detectors onto functional materials and heterostructures, enhancing performance and enabling proximal read-out of a wide range of individual excitations. Here, we top-down shape the prototypical two-dimensional superconductor niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) into few-layer nanowires less than 100 nm wide and demonstrate single-photon detection at 780 and 1550 nm. At the same time, the dark-count rate remains below 1 Hz up to the switching current and we achieve a timing jitter below 50 ps. We use a diffusive hot-spot model to estimate a theoretical cut-off wavelength that surpasses the millimetre range. Our results open up routes toward quantum limited detectors integrated into quantum-photonic circuits and quantum devices, with the potential for novel detection capabilities and unprecedented energy sensitivity.</p>

            <p>We computationally design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-$1/2$ C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</p>

            <p>Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for advancing nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for its exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material for magnonics and is typically grown into thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates due to near-perfect lattice matching. However, the paramagnetic nature of GGG introduces damping mechanisms detrimental to quantum applications at low temperatures. Here, we present a study of magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film grown on a 500$\,\mu$m-thick yttrium scandium gallium aluminium garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 30$\,$mK, we compare the damping characteristics of the YIG/YSGAG system with those of a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. Our results demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low magnetic damping from room temperature, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$, which is the lowest value reported so far for YIG/GGG films and comparable to the best YIG bulk material, and down to 30$\,$mK, with no significant temperature-dependent increase in damping. In this substrate, the low-temperature damping mechanisms associated with paramagnetic spins, prominent in GGG, are effectively eliminated. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Controlling quantum matter with light offers a promising route to dynamically tune its many-body properties, ranging from band topology to superconductivity. However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron systems in the steady-state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate all-optical switching of the spin-valley degree of freedom of itinerant ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated phases at various moiré lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and ferromagnetic metals. We show that the spin-valley orientation of all of these phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the attractive polaron transition with circularly-polarized light. These findings not only constitute the first direct evidence for non-thermal switching of a ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field, but also demonstrate the possibility of dynamical control over topological order parameter, paving the way for all-optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle TI spacer layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples, and the IEC modulates its critical behavior between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance. In contrast, thicker QAH samples behave as a three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher temperatures. We employ a magnetic TI Hamiltonian with random magnetic domains to understand the IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition observed near QAH PPT.</p>

            <p>The field of two-dimensional (2D) materials has grown dramatically in the last two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computation applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals (vdW) materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. In order to overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest including graphene, phosphorene, MoS$_2$, CrI$_3$, VSe$_2$, GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.</p>

            <h2>Topological Invariants in the Pore Morphology Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Alonso-Marroquin</p>
            <p>This study introduces a pore morphology algorithm that emphasizes the central role of topology in multiphase flow through porous media. Analysis of drainage in lattice-based pore networks identifies two key quantities, the percolation threshold and residual saturation, as topological invariants. These descriptors, which are based solely on connectivity rather than geometric details, capture the essential structure of the network. The percolation threshold is interpreted as a topological phase transition, marking the transition from global connectivity of the defending fluid to isolated clusters of trapped fluid. The universality of scaling exponents across different lattice geometries reveals the existence of topological universality classes, where systems with equivalent connectivity display identical critical behavior. This topological framework underscores the robustness of the identified invariants and provides a general basis for upscaling pore-scale processes in complex media.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic critical exponents as an emergent property at interacting topological quantum critical points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Fei Zhou</p>
            <p>In standard studies of quantum critical points (QCPs), the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is introduced as a fundamental parameter along with global symmetries to identify universality classes. Often, the dynamic critical exponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field theory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time symmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we study a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$ quantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a protecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that when strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly interacting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another family of gapless tQCPs with dynamic critical exponent $z=1$, without breaking the protecting symmetry. Our studies suggest that dynamic critical exponents, as well as the degrees of freedom in fermion fields, can crucially depend on interactions in topological quantum phase transitions; in tQCPs, to a large extent, they are better thought of as emergent properties.</p>

            <p>The interaction between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and structural properties of graphene-based devices. In this work, we employ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the interlayer interactions and stacking-fault energy (SFE) between graphene and hBN. We generated QMC energies for several rigid bilayer stacking configurations and fitted these data to the Kolmogorov-Crespi type interlayer potential (ILP) model. Our QMC-derived potential offers a more reliable alternative to conventional density functional theory methods, which are prone to errors in predicting properties in van der Waals materials. This study enables highly accurate predictions of structural and electronic properties in graphene hBN heterostructures. The resulting ILP-QMC potential is made available for further use in simulating complex systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) on hBN.</p>

In this letter, we describe shot noise measurements in a graphene quantum point contact in the quantum Hall regime. At large magnetic field, the competition between confinement and electronic interactions gives rise to a quantum dot located at the saddle point of the quantum point contact. We show that the presence of this quantum dot leads to a $50-100~\%$ increase in the shot noise, which we attribute to correlated charge tunneling. Our results highlight the role played by the electrostatic environment in those graphene devices.</p>

            <p>We develop a new model for phase transformation kinetics in metals by generalizing the Levitas-Preston (LP) phase field model of martensite phase transformations (see Levitas and Preston (2002a,b); Levitas, Preston and Lee (2003)) to arbitrary pressure. Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\alpha\to\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data regarding the microstructure of the sample in question.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate chiral domain walls (DWs) formed in radially magnetized nanotubes composed of ultrathin layers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Unlike those with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, the stable configurations of DWs in PMA nanotubes are influenced not only by exchange interactions but also by magnetostatic interactions induced by the radial component of magnetization. Particularly, the magnetostatic interactions lead to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)-like effects that stabilize chiral Néel-type DWs. We derive expressions for the effective magnetic fields acting on DWs within PMA nanotubes and quantify spin-orbit torque (SOT) driven DW motion using an analytical one-dimensional model, which is validated by micromagnetic simulations. Our results show that the DMI-like field due to magnetostatic interactions can be as significant as the contribution of material-induced DMI in nanotubes with diameters below $100\,$nm. This implies that the direction and speed of DW motion in the PMA nanotubes could differ from those observed in flat nanoribbons composed of the same material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DW velocity can be effectively controlled by adjusting the tube diameter and exchange stiffness constant of the magnetic layer, rather than relying solely on material-induced DMI. These insights are expected to greatly expand the potential applications of PMA nanotube-based DW devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Meng, Lei Cai, Xiuqiang Wu, Xianghe Zhao, Jia Xu, Guanqi Wang</p>
            <p>We study the Josephson effect in one-dimensional SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnetic layers (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the potential barrier at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface can induce a quantized resonant tunneling effect. This effect not only modifies the amplitude of the critical current but also affects the phase of the Josephson current. As the exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, the critical current displays periodic resonance peaks. These peaks occur under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)} d_{1(2)} = \left(n_{1(2)} + 1/2\right) \pi$, where $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ is the center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, with $v_F$ being the Fermi velocity, and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. It can be inferred that the potential barrier suppresses the transport of spin-singlet pairs while allowing spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis to pass through. As these spin-triplet pairs traverse the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers, the total phase they acquire determines the ground state of the Josephson junction. At the resonance peaks, the Josephson current primarily arises from the first harmonic in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations. However, in perpendicular configurations, the second harmonic becomes more significant. In scenarios where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while allowing it to persist in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.</p>

            <p>A quantum phase transition arises from competition between different ground states and is typically accessed by varying a single physical parameter near absolute zero temperature. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect with high Chern number C has recently been achieved in magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoTe$_2$, provide a versatile platform for exploring correlated topological phases. This work investigates the interplay of perpendicular magnetic and electric fields in tuning the electronic structure and emergent topological orders of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (t-MoTe$_2$) across two distinct regimes: a low-twist-angle phase ($\theta\approx2.1^\circ$) hosting multiple Chern bands of identical Chern numbers per valley, and a higher-angle phase ($\theta\approx 3.89^\circ$) featuring Haldane-like bands with opposite Chern numbers. Using a continuum model incorporating moiré potentials up to second harmonics, we compute the Hofstadter fractal spectra under applied fields, revealing Landau fan structures and magnetic-flux-dependent band topology. These fractal spectra are useful in studying emergent topological orders in terms of the composite fermion picture, where the statistical Chern-Simons flux is approximated as a uniform gauge field. We demonstrate that the system hosts both Jain-sequence fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) and non-Jain "fractal FCIs" with higher Chern numbers. The electric field suppresses composite fermion gaps and induces topological quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis extends to valley-contrasting flux attachment, proposing pathways to describe fractional quantum spin Hall states.</p>

However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Illia Lukin, Andrii Sotnikov, Alexander L. Burin</p>
            <p>Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</p>

            <p>The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers.

The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under {this https URL}. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.</p>

Motivated by earlier theoretical predictions of temperature-induced spectral shifts and van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion~[S. S. Pershoguba \textit{et al}., Dirac Magnons in Honeycomb Ferromagnets, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. X {\textbf{8}}, 011010 (2018)}], we go beyond the commonly used thermal magnon approximation by applying second-order perturbation theory in a fully numerical framework. Our analysis uncovers significant deviations from previous analysis: in particular, the predicted singularities are absent, consistent with recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements~[S. E. Nikitin \textit{et al}., Thermal Evolution of Dirac Magnons in the Honeycomb Ferromagnet CrBr$_3$, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\textbf{129}}, 127201 (2022)}]. Moreover, we find that the temperature dependence of the renormalized magnon spectrum exhibits a distinct $T^3$ behavior for the optical magnon branch, while retaining $T^2$ behavior for the acoustic or down magnon band. This feature sheds new light on the collective dynamics of Dirac magnons and their interactions. We further compare the honeycomb case with a triangular Bravais lattice, relevant for ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, and show that both systems lack singular features while displaying quite distinct thermal trends.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iuliia Kiseleva, Boris Koppitz, Elke Beyreuther, Matthias Roeper, Samuel D. Seddon, Lukas M. Eng</p>
            <p>Conductive domain walls (CDWs) in the uniaxial ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) have attracted a lot of interest as potential elements in 2D nanoelectronics, due to their orders-of-magnitude larger electronic AC and DC conductivities as compared to the host material. On the way towards generating standardized CDWs into z-cut bulk LN crystals with controllable geometry and electrical properties, we have encountered setbacks recently: Although the first preparation step, i.e., the established UV-light-assisted liquid-electrode poling, reliably creates fully penetrating hexagonal domains with the DWs being aligned almost parallel to the polarization axis, the second step in the DW 'conductivity-enhancement' process through post-growth voltage ramping, resulted in randomly-shaped DWs as reflected in their different current-voltage (I-V) characteristics even after having applied the same process parameters. To clarify this phenomenon, we present here an \textit{in-situ} and time-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) microscopy investigation of DW samples of different sizes, monitoring the DW evolution during that critical voltage ramping, which allowed us to reconstruct the 3D DW shapes both prior to and after the enhancement process. As a result, we are able to map the temporal changes of the local DW inclination angle $\alpha$, and to quantify the DW velocity. As a consequence, we need to re-assess and re-think the origin of the DW conductivity (DWC) in LN: The hitherto assumed simple connection between $\alpha$ and the DWC can not be generalized, since point defects accumulating along DWs act as extra sources for charge carrier trapping/release, significantly contributing to the DW current.</p>

            <h2>Weyl nodes in CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ studied by dynamical mean-field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorūnas Dobilas, Martin Brass, Frank T. Ebel, Silke Paschen, Karsten Held</p>
            <p>The heavy fermion compound CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ was recently shown to exhibit a spontaneous nonlinear Hall effect, indicating its topological nature. This is consistent with the lack of inversion symmetry that allows for the existence of Weyl nodes. Here, we employ density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory, which is state-of-the-art for strongly correlated materials, and study the topology of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$. We find five inequivalent Weyl nodes of either type I or II, each having either eight or sixteen symmetry-related replicas. These Weyl nodes bridge the Kondo insulating gap, which is a direct but not an indirect gap. The Weyl points closest to the Fermi level are situated only 0.5 meV below it, and have a very flat dispersion. Our ab initio results establish CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ as a model system for investigating the interplay between strong electronic correlations and nontrivial topology. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for future studies of quantum transport and interaction-driven topological phases in heavy-fermion systems.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the rich topology and interesting quasi-band structure of twisted moire materials subjected to light, we study a non-twisted moire material under the influence of light. Our work is in part motivated by a desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally elucidate the interesting physics of moiré materials coupled to light. Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.</p>

            <h2>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in bilayer nickelates: Impact of quasi-quantum metric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiichiro Onari, Daisuke Inoue, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.</p>

            <h2>Tailoring 4H-SiC Surface Electronic States by Atomic-Layer Deposition for Ideal Peta-Ohm Resistors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuying Xi, Helios Y. Li, Guohui Li, Qingmei Su, Kaili Mao, Bingshe Xu, Yuying Hao, Nicholas X. Fang, Yanxia Cui</p>
            <p>High resolution resistors capable of detecting minuscule currents are vital for advanced sensors, but existing off-shelf models struggle with inconsistent resistance under varying voltages. The underlying physics of this issue is rooted in unstable surface charges and intrinsic inhomogeneity of surface potential caused by spontaneous polarization (SP) in commercial semi-insulating silicon carbide (SiC) devices. In this work, we found that coating SiC surfaces with an ultrathin zinc oxide layer immobilizes the dangling surface charges in place and balances the natural electric field of the material, ensuring stable resistance even at extreme voltages up to 1000 V. The resulting SiC resistor maintains a record-high resistance of one peta-ohm (10^15 {\Omega}) with negligible voltage fluctuations, outperforming conventional options. Additionally, these devices can switch states when exposed to light or heat, making them dual-purpose tools for ultra-sensitive measurements and sensors. This breakthrough combines high stability, scalability for mass production, and multifunctionality, opening doors to next-generation precision technologies in fields like quantum sensing and environmental monitoring.</p>

            <h2>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhayan Sahu, Guifre Vidal</p>
            <p>We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</p>

            <h2>Squeezing generation crossing a mean-field critical point: Work statistics, irreversibility and critical fingerprints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando J. Gómez-Ruiz, Stefano Gherardini, Ricardo Puebla</p>
            <p>Understanding the dynamical consequences of quantum phase transitions on thermodynamical quantities, such as work statistics and entropy production, is one of the most intriguing aspect of quantum many-body systems, pinpointing the emergence of irreversibility to critical features. In this work, we investigate the critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for a mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a thermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to non-zero dimensional many-body systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a finite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of infinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle results in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive analytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy, depending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form of the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability of observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible entropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the critical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the temperature of the initial thermal state. Finally, we determine the irreversibility traits under squeezing generation at zero-temperature using the relative entropy of coherence.</p>

            <p>Function in natural systems arises from one-dimensional sequences forming three-dimensional structures with specific properties. However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves "conflicted" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD < 2 Å) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.</p>

            <h2>Eigen-SNAP gate for photonic qubits in a cavity-transmon system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcus Meschede, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.</p>

            <h2>Spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric sphere in the modified Langevin noise formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Miano, Loris Maria Cangemi, Carlo Forestiere</p>
            <p>This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter is described via two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density and initial quantum state. For initial thermal states of the two reservoirs at different temperatures, the standard approach based on the knowledge of the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object at the quantum emitter position cannot be employed. We map the two reservoirs to a single equivalent reservoir with a temperature-dependent effective spectral density and initially in its vacuum state, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.</p>

            <p>We consider Lindbladian operator dynamics in many-body quantum systems with one or more integrals of motion (IOM), subject to weak local dissipation. We demonstrate that IOMs with small support become slow modes of these dynamics, in the sense that their Frobenius norm decays more slowly compared to generic operators. As a result, the eigenoperators of such Lindbladians with slowest decay rates have a large overlap with the IOMs of the underlying Hamiltonian. We demonstrate this correspondence between slow modes and IOMs numerically for a number of many-body models, and further corroborate it with perturbative arguments. These results open up a new method for the identification of IOMs, and provide insights into the dissipative many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</p>

Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation against the non-Hermitian skin effect, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.</p>

            <p>Motivated by exploring correlated metals with frustrating bond-dependent exchange interactions, we study hole and electron doped Kitaev Mott insulators on the triangular lattice. Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K>0$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K<0$, both vanish at sufficiently large doping, beyond which we find regimes with chiral $d\pm i d$ singlet pairing and $p\pm ip$ triplet pairing respectively. Our tensor network computations however reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM order stubbornly persists for the doped $K<0$ model, the doped $K>0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K > 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\rm sc} < 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature bond-dependent exchange interactions.</p>

            <p>Algebraic/Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of critical quantum ground states that do not have a quasi-particle description. DSLs and related spin liquid phases often arise in strongly frustrated quantum spin systems, in which strong correlations and quantum fluctuations among constituent spins persist down to zero temperature. In this work, we analyze Mott insulating phases of $SU(3)$ fermions on a kagome lattice which may realize a DSL phase, described at low energies by $(2 + 1)d$ quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with $N_f=6$ Dirac fermions. By analyzing the action of physical symmetries on the operators of the QED$_3$ theory, we conclude that the low energy DSL is a quantum critical point that can be accessed by tuning a single microscopic parameter. Aided by the emergent symmetry and anomalies of the low energy effective theory, we conjecture and present supporting arguments that the $SU(3)$ Kagome magnet DSL is an unnecessary quantum critical point, lying completely within a single phase.</p>

            <p>We study the interference of chiral Majoranas in a magnetic topological insulator thin slab having a grounded section proximity coupled to a superconductor and another section under the influence of top-bottom electrostatic gating. The gated section locally widens an energy gap and mediates the coupling between the quantum anomalous Hall states of the leads and the chiral Majorana states of the proximitized sector. Local and non-local conductances offer measurable hints of the existence of transport mediated by chiral Majorana modes. Local conductances on the two leads reveal characteristic oscillatory patterns as a function of the gating strength, with peculiar correlations depending on the distance between gated and proximitized sectors. A gate tunable Majorana diode effect on nonlocal conductances emerges when the chemical potential deviates from zero. We suggest a protocol to identify chiral Majorana physics based on a sequence of electrostatic gates that allows the tuning of chiral Majorana interference.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multigap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the interplay between its multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in governing multiple superconducting gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the superconducting gap of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital weakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations reveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately -13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior experimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.</p>

            <p>Kagome materials have garnered substantial attention owing to their diverse physical phenomena, yet canonical systems such as the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family exhibit poor $Z_{2}$-type topological properties, spurring an urgent quest for kagome platforms hosting ideal topological states. Recently, Zhou et al. proposed the kagome-type IAMX family, which exhibits distinctive ideal topological states; however, their analysis is primarily restricted to the spinless approximation. In this work, we model relativistic effects in the IAMX family, demonstrating that tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength drives topological phase transitions and induces novel topological states, resulting in a rich phase diagram. The configuration of topological surface states evolves continuously as the SOC strength is modulated, consistent with the evolution of the topological phase transition. This suggests a viable route toward designing multi-functional topological devices. First-principles calculations performed on three specific IAMX compounds confirm that SOC governs their topological phases, in complete accord with our model analysis.</p>

            <h2>Scalable implementations of mean-field and correlation methods based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation of spin Hamiltonians in the Jordan-Wigner representation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shadan Ghassemi Tabrizi, Thomas M. Henderson, Thomas D. Kühne, Gustavo E. Scuseria</p>
            <p>Recent work has highlighted that the strong correlation inherent in spin Hamiltonians can be effectively reduced by mapping spins to fermions via the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JW). The Hartree-Fock method is straightforward in the fermionic domain and may provide a reasonable approximation to the ground state. Correlation with respect to the fermionic mean-field can be recovered based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation (LAST) with two-body correlators. Specifically, a unitary LAST variant eliminates the dependence on site ordering, while a non-unitary LAST yields size-extensive correlation energies. Whereas the first recent demonstration of such methods was restricted to small spin systems, we present efficient implementations using analytical gradients for the optimization with respect to the mean-field reference and the LAST parameters, thereby enabling the treatment of larger clusters, including systems with local spins s > 1/2.</p>

            <h2>Learning Reaction-Diffusion Kinetics from Mechanical Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Royal C. Ihuaenyi, Hongbo Zhao, Ruqing Fang, Ruobing Bai, Martin Z. Bazant, Juner Zhu</p>
            <p>A central challenge in materials science is characterizing chemical processes that are elusive to direct measurement, particularly in functional materials operating under realistic conditions. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios: classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties, including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in materials science and engineering.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of higher-order cumulants in quantum isotropic spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shixian Jiang, Jianpeng Liu, Jianmin Yuan, Xi-Wen Guan, Yongqiang Li</p>
            <p>Understanding universal behavior of far-from-equilibrium transport dynamics at a quantum many body level is a longstanding challenge. In particular, a full characterization of universal dynamics of nonlocal correlation functions still remains largely unknown. In this letter, we uncover universal scaling laws of higher-order cumulants in one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, revealing anomalous behaviors of nonequilibrium dynamics exclusively accessible in higher-order correlations. By means of numerical simulations and full counting statistics, we determine the power laws of both the spin polarization transfer and contrast cumulants for different kinds of helix and domain-wall initial states. Building on such physical states, we unify the scaling behavior of the higher-order cumulants, giving rise to two types of dynamics: anomalous diffusive and superdiffusive. For the former, these higher cumulants show a deviation from Gaussian statistics, with the scaling exponents being identical for the first four orders. For the latter, however, we observe a breakdown of KPZ universality, with the exponents of the third and fourth orders differing significantly from those of the first two. Our results are also agreeable with recent experimental observations, advancing understanding of far-from-equilibrium transport phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Neo-Gibbsian Statistical Energetics with Applications to Nonequilibrium Cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing Miao, Hong Qian, Yong-Shi Wu</p>
            <p>Generalization through novel interpretations of the inner logic of the century-old Gibbs' statistical thermodynamics is presented: i) Identifying $k_B\to 0$ as classical energetics, one directly derives a pair of thermodynamic variational formulae \[ F(T) = \min_{E\ge E_{min}}\Big\{E-TS(E) \Big\} \,\text{ and }\ S(E) = \min_{T>0}\left\{\frac{E}{T}-\frac{F(T)}{T} \right\}, \] that dictate all the more familiar $1/T=d S(E)/d E$, $E=d\{F(T)/T\}/d(1/T)$, and $S(E)=-d F(T)/d T$ in equilibrium, which is maintained by a duality symmetry with one-to-one relation between $T^{\text{eq}}(E)=\arg\min_T\{E/T-F(T)/T\}$ and $E^{\text{eq}}(T)=\arg\min_E\{E-TS(E)\}$. ii) In contradistinction, taking derivative of the statistical free energy w.r.t. $T$, a mesoscopic energetics with fluctuations emerges: This yields two information entropy functions which historically appeared 50 years postdate Gibbs' theory. iii) Combining the above pair of inequalities yields an irreversible thermodynamic potential $\psi(T,E) \equiv \{E-F(T)\}/T-S(E)\ge 0$ for nonequilibrium states. The second law of thermodynamics as a universal principle reflects $\psi\ge 0$ due to a disagreement between $E$ and $T$ as a dual pair. Our theory provides a new energetics of living cells which are nonequilibrium, complex entities under constant $T$, pressure $p$ and chemical potential $\mu$. $\psi$ provides a ``distance'' between statistical data from a large ensemble of cells and a set of intrinsic energetic parameters that encode the information within.</p>

            <h2>Experimental demonstration of two distinct pathways of trion generation in monolayer MoS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faiha Mujeeb, Arkaprava Chowdhury, Anindya Datta, Subhabrata Dhar</p>
            <p>Excitation power and energy dependent photoluminescence (PL) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies are carried out on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown 1L-MoS2 films to understand the process of trion formation. The study shows that the excitation with sufficiently low photon energy results in the creation of trions directly in the K/K' valleys through photon absorption followed by phonon scattering events. On the other hand, excitation energy sufficiently larger than the band-gap can generate the carriers away from the K/K' valleys. Dissimilarity in the rates of relaxation of the photo-excited electrons and the holes to the bottom of the K/K' valleys results in the transformation of the excitons residing there into trions. Our TAS study clearly demonstrates a temporary increase of the trion population in the K/K' valleys. Moreover, excitation intensity dependent PL spectroscopy performed under above-band-gap excitation, also suggests the coexistence of both the pathways of trion generation in this material. This conclusion is further validated by a rate equation model. Our findings provide valuable insight into the formation of trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), which could be crucial in designing valleytronic devices based on trions.</p>

In the continuum limit, this problem was solved by Lord Kelvin, who found a non-uniform charge distribution with an integrable singularity at the boundary. To explore the discrete analogue, we developed an efficient numerical method that enables energy minimization while maintaining the number of charges at the cap's edge fixed. Using this approach we have obtained numerical results for various values of N and cap angular widths. Based on these results, we analyze the emergence and behavior of topological defects as functions of both N and the cap's curvature.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Near-Field Hydrodynamic Interactions on Bacterial Dynamics Near a Solid Surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baopi Liu, Lu Chen, Haiqin Wang</p>
            <p>Near-field hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria and no-slip solid surfaces are the main mechanism underlying surface entrapment of bacteria. In this study, we employ a chiral two-body model to simulate bacterial dynamics near the surface. The simulation results show that as bacteria approach the surface, their translational and rotational velocities, as well as their diffusion coefficients, decrease. Under the combination of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces, bacteria reach a stable fixed point in the phase plane and follow circular trajectories at this point. Notably, bacteria with left-handed helical flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. During this process, as the stable height increases, the translational velocity parallel to the surface increases while the rotational velocity perpendicular to the surface decreases, collectively increasing the radius of curvature. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that near-field hydrodynamic interactions significantly prolong the surface residence time of bacteria. Additionally, smaller stable heights further amplify this effect, resulting in longer residence times and enhanced surface entrapment.</p>

            <h2>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in bilayer nickelates: Impact of quasi-quantum metric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiichiro Onari, Daisuke Inoue, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Wei Zhang, Kaijie Yang, Chong Wang, Xiaoyu Liu, Ting Cao, Di Xiao</p>
            <p>We develop a twist-angle transferable continuum model for twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (tTMD) homobilayers, using tMoTe2 and tWSe2 as examples. All model parameters are extracted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations at a single twist angle (3.89°) and monolayer data. Our model captures both lattice relaxation effects and the long-range behavior of piezoelectric and ferroelectric potentials. Leveraging lattice relaxations obtained via machine learning force fields (MLFFs), the model can be efficiently transferred to other twist angles without requiring additional DFT calculations. It accurately reproduces the DFT band dispersions and quantum geometries across a wide range of twist angles. Furthermore, our model reveals that a second flat Chern band arises near 2° when the interlayer potential difference becomes comparable to the interlayer tunneling. This continuum model provides a clear understanding and starting point for engineering novel electronic phases in moiré TMDs through twist angles and lattice relaxations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. M. Gokhfeld, Yu. S. Gokhfeld</p>
            <p>The determination of the critical current density from magnetic hysteresis loops is widely used to characterize and compare superconducting samples. Magnetic hysteresis loops for tapes and single crystals depend on both the critical current density and sample size. The latter sets the scale of supercurrent circulation. However, in polycrystalline high-temperature superconductors prepared by solid-phase synthesis or by sol-gel method, the magnetization is determined by the circulation of supercurrents in individual grains. The paper discusses the effect of the grain size distribution on the effective scale of current circulation. Log-normal and Weibull distributions are both considered as possible for grain sizes. The effective size for calculating the intragrain current density has been shown to be significantly larger than the average grain size.</p>

            <p>Adhesion plays a pivotal role in computer chip manufacturing, directly affecting the precision and durability of positioning components such as wafer stages. Electrical biasing is widely employed to eliminate floating potential and to enable electrostatic clamping. However, upon electrical grounding adhesion can persist and there is limited knowledge about the nature of this adhesion hysteresis. Here, we investigate potential causes underlying electric field-induced adhesion hysteresis at the interface between an n-type AFM tip and a p-type silicon sample using atomic force microscopy. Our findings reveal that neither charge trapping nor siloxane bond formation significantly impacts the measured adhesion. Surprisingly, we show that adhesion can be tuned through electric field-induced water adsorption under low relative humidity (RH < 10%). Our results provide new insights into adhesion hysteresis and opportunities for adhesion control.</p>

            <h2>How Machine Learning Predicts Fluid Densities under Nanoconfinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanhao Li</p>
            <p>Fluids under nanoscale confinement differ -- and often dramatically -- from their bulk counterparts. A notorious feature of nanoconfined fluids is their inhomogeneous density profile along the confining dimension, which plays a key role in many fluid structural and transport phenomena in nanopores. Nearly five decades of theoretical efforts on predicting this phenomenon (fluid layering) have shown that its complexity resists purely analytical treatments; as a consequence, nearly all current approaches make extensive use of molecular simulations, and tend not to have generalizable predictive capabilities. In this work, we demonstrate that machine-learning-based models (in particular, a random forest model), trained upon large molecular simulation data sets, can serve as reliable surrogates in lieu of further molecular simulation. We show that this random forest model has excellent interpolative capabilities over a wide range of temperatures and confining lengthscales, and even has modest extrapolative ability. These results provide a promising pathway forward for developing models of nanoconfined fluid properties that are generalizable, lower cost than ``pure" molecular simulation, and sufficiently predictive for fluids-in-nanopores practitioners.}</p>

            <p>We present an end-to-end, symmetry-aware pipeline that converts interacting fermionic and quantum-spin models into annealer-ready QUBOs while preserving low-energy physics. The workflow combines Bravyi-Kitaev encoding, exact Z2 symmetry tapering, Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) diagonalization to a Z-only form, and k-local to 2-local quadratization, with ground energies recovered via a Dinkelbach fixed-point over the resulting Ising objective. We validate the approach across a complexity ladder: (i) a frustrated 2D Ising model run on a D-Wave Advantage QPU reproduces the known ferromagnet-stripe transition; (ii) finite-temperature checks on 1D Ising recover standard finite-size trends; (iii) a genuinely quantum spin target (XXZ) matches exact diagonalization (ED) on small chains; and (iv) interacting fermions (t-V) in 1D (rings L=2-8) show ED-level energies and the expected kink near V/t ~ 2, with a 2D 2x2 cluster tracking ED slopes up to a uniform offset. A replication-factor study quantifies the accuracy-overhead trade-off, with order-of-magnitude error reduction and diminishing returns beyond r ~ Nq. Except for the classical Ising benchmark and molecular benchmarks, experiments use D-Wave's public DIMOD and Neal simulators; a molecular benzene case in the appendix illustrates portability beyond lattices. The results establish a practical pathway for mapping quantum matter to current annealers, with clear knobs for fidelity, resources, and embedding.</p>

            <p>Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) represent arguably the most successful application of machine learning to materials science, demonstrating remarkable performance across diverse applications. However, critical blind spots in their reliability persist. Here, we address one such significant gap by systematically investigating the accuracy of uMLIPs under extreme pressure conditions from 0 to 150 GPa. Our benchmark reveals that while these models excel at standard pressure, their predictive accuracy deteriorates considerably as pressure increases. This decline in performance originates from fundamental limitations in the training data rather than in algorithmic constraints. In fact, we show that through targeted fine-tuning on high-pressure configurations, the robustness of the models can be easily increased. These findings underscore the importance of identifying and addressing overlooked regimes in the development of the next generation of truly universal interatomic potentials.</p>

            <p>We investigate the microscopic origin and spectral features of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) in collinear antiferromagnets with trigonal crystal fields, using $\alpha$-MnTe as a prototypical example. Although such systems exhibit zero net magnetization, we demonstrate that XMCD can emerge from the anisotropic magnetic dipole operator $T_{z}$, arising from quadrupolar spin distributions. By constructing a complete multipole basis and analyzing the symmetry conditions under trigonal distortion, we identify specific spin and orbital configurations that enable a finite XMCD response. Further, we employ both one-electron and multi-electron models, including spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions, to calculate the XMCD spectra for various $d^n$ configurations. Our findings provide theoretical benchmarks for XMCD in altermagnets and highlight the key role of orbital symmetry and magnetic anisotropy in realizing observable dichroic effects.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), with its strong in-plane bonding and good lattice match to hcp and fcc metals, offers a promising alternative barrier material for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we investigate spin-dependent transport in hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$$/$$h$-BN$/$hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$(0001) MTJs with physisorption-type interfaces using first-principles calculations. We find that a high TMR ratio arises from the resonant tunneling of the down-spin surface states of the hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$, having a $\Delta_1$-like symmetry around the $\Gamma$ point. Ni doping tunes the Fermi level and enhances this effect by reducing the overlap between up-spin and down-spin conductance channels in momentum space under the parallel configuration, thereby suppressing antiparallel conductance and increasing the TMR ratio. This mechanism is analogous to Brillouin zone spin filtering and is sensitive to the interfacial distance but not specific to $h$-BN barriers; similar behavior may emerge in MTJs with other two-dimensional insulators or semiconductors. These findings provide insight into surface-state-assisted tunneling mechanisms and offer guidance for the interface engineering of next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The interplay of nanoscale electronic domains underpins many emergent phenomena of quantum materials, including the competition between charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates, or the storage of information in phase-change memory devices. Coupling to electronic domains provides an observable for pinpointing key interactions, e.g. affecting phase transitions. While the equilibrium phase diagram of 1T-TaS2 - characterized by unique transport properties and varying degrees of CDW commensurability - has been studied extensively, an understanding of how the electronic domains in the bulk behave across phase boundaries is lacking. We reveal the three-dimensional evolution of electronic domains in 1T-TaS2 using temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space mapping, complemented by structure factor simulations based on the Hendricks-Teller method. With this methodology, we identify an increasing number of stacking faults near the phase transitions, and a growing fraction of dimerized layers in the commensurate phase upon cooling. We provide structural evidence that the CDW domains mediate the transport properties at phase boundaries, and that they also account for an anomalous intermediate electronic phase within the triclinic regime upon heating. As a paradigmatic material with potential in phase-change memory applications, our study underscores the importance of domain sizes and layer stacking in defining electronic behaviors of van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>Mott physics is at the root of a plethora of many-body quantum phenomena in quantum materials. Recently, the stacked or twisted structures of van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a unique platform for realizing exotic correlated states in the vicinity of the Mott transition. However, the definitive feature of Mottness and how it rules the low-energy electronic state remain elusive and experimentally inaccessible in many interesting regimes. Here, we quantitatively describe a filling-controlled Mott state and its interplay with superconductivity by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy in a vdW bulk heterostructure, 4Hb-TaS$_2$, that interleaves strongly correlated 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with superconducting 1H-Ta$_2$ layers. The fine tunability of electron doping induced by interlayer charge transfer allows us to continuously track the spectral function with unsurpassed energy resolution from a depleted narrow band (0.2 electrons per site) toward a Mott transition at half filling. The gradually emerging Mott-Hubbard bands, followed by the sharpening and vanishing of the central quasiparticle peak as predicted in the Brinkman-Rice scenario, unambiguously demonstrate the Mott physics at play. Importantly, the renormalization of the low-energy electrons acts destructively on the superconducting pairing potential, leaving behind nonsuperconducting, paramagnetic puddles at the nanoscale. Our results reveal a seminal system near the border of the Mott criterion that enables us to illustrate the predictive power of the Hubbard model, and set such heterostructures as promising ground for realizing new correlated states in the heavily doped Mott regime.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism, particularly 2D altermagnetism (AM), has attracted considerable interest due to its exceptional physical properties and broad application potential. However, the classification of AM undergoes a fundamental paradigm shift when transitioning from three-dimensional (3D) to 2D symmetry-enforced fully compensated collinear magnetism$-$a shift that has remained largely overlooked. Here, by extending unconventional magnetism to 2D collinear systems, we identify the symmetry conditions and electronic band characteristics of a distinct magnetic phase: type-IV magnetism. This new class lies beyond the established descriptions of ferromagnetism, conventional antiferromagnetism, and AM. Type-IV magnetism supports the successive emergence of both nonrelativistic spin-degenerate and relativistic spin-splitting phenomena, belonging strictly to neither conventional antiferromagnetism nor standard AM. We further establish a universal symmetry classification framework for 2D type-IV magnets via a mapping from the collinear spin layer group to the magnetic layer group. Monolayer MgCr$_2$O$_3$ and monolayer BaMn$_2$Ch$_3$ (Ch=Se, Te) are showcased as representative materials, exhibiting gate-tunable reversible spin textures and the quantum electric Hall effect, respectively. Our work underscores the rich functional prospects of type-IV magnets, offering a new route toward spin manipulation and anomalous transport that promises innovative designs for high-performance spintronic devices.</p>

Here, we explore the development of a sacrificial nanocrystal deposit that can suppress friction and wear. Amorphous \ce{CaSO4} nancrystals are deposited through salt solution droplet deposition followed by evaporation. During droplet drying, a precursor film of the aqueous \ce{CaSO4} solution spreads onto a hydrophilic silicon wafer, thus nucleating evenly spread unfaceted amorphous nanocrystals of \ce{CaSO4} on the wafer surface. We used atomic force microscopy to study the extent, topography, and friction and wear behavior of the deposited nanocrystals. We find that the sacrificial layer of nanocrystals is easy to apply and remove, spreads over large (few cm) areas with a constant thickness of about 8 nm, and has favorable friction and wear behavior.</p>

            <p>We present MACE-Field, a field-aware $O(3)$-equivariant interatomic potential that provides a compact, derivative-consistent route to dielectric properties (such as polarisation $\mathbf P$, Born effective charges $Z^*$ and polarisability $\boldsymbol\alpha$) and finite-field simulations across chemistry for inorganic solids. A uniform electric field is injected within each message-passing layer via a Clebsch-Gordan tensor-product which couples the field to latent spherical-tensor features, and perturbs them via an equivariant residual mixing. This plug-in design preserves the standard MACE readout and can inherit existing MACE foundation weights, turning pretrained models into field-aware ones with minimal change. To demonstrate, we train: (i) a cross-chemistry ferroelectric polarisation model (2.5k nonpolar$\!\to$polar polarisation branches), (ii) a cross-chemistry BECs/polarisability model ($\sim$6k Materials Project dielectrics spanning 81 elements), and (iii-iv) single-material molecular dynamics on BaTiO$_3$ and $\alpha$-SiO$_2$. The models recover polarisation branches and spontaneous polarisation, predict $Z^*$ and $\boldsymbol\alpha$ (hence $\varepsilon_\infty$) across diverse chemistries, and reproduce BaTiO$_3$ hysteresis and the IR/Raman and dielectric spectra of $\alpha$-quartz, benchmarking comparatively with Allegro-pol.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic instabilities in driven chiral suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seema Chahal, Brato Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>Active Stokesian suspensions are conventionally understood to generate dipolar stresses that destabilize aligned states in the bulk and drive system-wide spatiotemporally chaotic flows. Here, we report dynamics in suspensions of torque-driven spinning chiral particles that exhibit a distinct and previously unrecognized route to collective dynamics. Using a mean-field kinetic theory, stability analysis, and nonlinear simulations, we demonstrate how flows driven by torque monopoles and self-propulsion resulting from microscopic chirality drive chaotic flows in three dimensions. Unlike the well-known alignment instability of dipolar active matter, the present dynamics is intrinsically tied to self-propulsion and relies on the emergent coupling between nematic and polar order. Our results establish a novel route to pattern formation, suggest strategies for designing torque-driven active suspensions, and provide a mechanistic framework to probe the rheology of chiral fluids.</p>

            <h2>Hyperfine interaction of electrons confined in CsPbI$_3$ nanocrystals with nuclear spin fluctuations</h2>

            <p>The coherent spin dynamics of electrons are investigated for CsPbI$_3$ perovskite nanocrystals in a glass matrix using time-resolved Faraday ellipticity. In nanocrystals with a diameter of about 11 nm, the Larmor precession frequency has a linear dependence on magnetic field corresponding to the electron Landé $g$-factor of 2.07. We find a finite Larmor precession frequency at zero magnetic field, corresponding to the electron spin splitting of $0.8$ $\mu$eV. This splitting is explained by the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spin fluctuations. Our model analysis shows that the hyperfine interaction for the conduction band electrons is contributed both by the $p$-orbitals of the lead atoms and by the $s$-orbitals of the iodine atoms, with the leading contribution to the hyperfine field fluctuations coming from iodine. This fact agrees well with the 9% iodine contribution to the Bloch amplitude of the conduction band, obtained by DFT calculations. From these findings, the atomic hyperfine constant for the $5s$-orbital of iodine is evaluated as 190 $\mu$eV.</p>

            <h2>Realizing an Atomtronic AQUID in a Rotating-Box Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaspar Görg, Ludwig Mathey, Vijay Pal Singh</p>
            <p>Atomtronic devices are matter-wave circuits designed to emulate the functional behavior of their electronic counterparts. Motivated by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), atomic quantum interference devices (AQUIDs) have been developed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in toroidal geometries. Here, we propose and numerically investigate an alternative implementation of an AQUID based on a BEC confined in a rotating box potential. A ring-like topology is established by introducing a central depletion region via a repulsive potential barrier. We observe the hallmark AQUID feature -- quantized phase winding that increases in discrete steps with angular velocity. Centrifugal effects induced by rotation degrade phase coherence and impair AQUID performance, which we mitigate by applying a counteracting harmonic confinement. Phase slips are found to be mediated by a vortex propagating from the central depletion zone to the edge of the condensate. To characterize the voltage response, we induce a bias current by translating the box along its long axis while keeping the central barrier fixed. This generates a density imbalance between the two reservoirs, exhibiting a periodic dependence on angular velocity -- analogous to the voltage-flux relation in electronic SQUIDs. Our results demonstrate that rotating box geometries provide a viable and flexible platform for realizing atomtronic AQUIDs with controllable dynamics and well-defined response characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Wurtzite MnSe as a barrier for CdSe quantum wells with built-in electric field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. J. Grzybowski, W. Pacuski, J. Suffczyński</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic materials have attracted a lot of attention recently due to the numerous effects, which have an application potential and occur due to the spin-split band structure coexisting with the compensated magnetic order. Incorporation of such intriguing compounds into low-dimensional structures represents an important avenue towards exploiting and enhancing their functionalities. Prominent examples of this group are semiconductors well suited to the band-gap engineering strategies. Here, we present for the first time visible-light-emitting CdSe quantum wells, in which wurtzite MnSe as an alermagnetic candidate plays the role of a barrier. Photoluminescence experiments with temporal resolution demonstrate that in such quantum wells, a built-in electric field is present and strongly influences the energies of the emitted photons, the dynamics of recombination, and excitation power dependence. Numerical simulations allow us to estimate that the magnitude of the electric field is 14MV/m. We anticipate that such quantum wells offer potential to probe the barrier properties and that wurtzite MnSe is an interesting platform to study the interplay of the altermagnetism and built-in electric field.</p>
