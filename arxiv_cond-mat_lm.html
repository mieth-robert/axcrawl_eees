            <h2>Breakdown of Quantum Chaos in the Staggered-Field XXZ Chain: Confinement and Meson Formation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julia Wildeboer, Marton Lajer, Robert M. Konik</p>
            <p>Confinement of fractionalized excitations can strongly restructure many-body spectra. We investigate this phenomenon in the gapped spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a staggered field, where spinons bind into domain-wall ``mesons'' deep in the antiferromagnetic phase. We present evidence that this non-integrable model exhibits both Hilbert space fractionalization and quantum scar formation as controlled by the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$. Exact diagonalization across symmetry-resolved sectors reveals a crossover from Gaussian-orthogonal (chaotic) level statistics at weak anisotropy $\Delta \sim 1$ to non-ergodic behavior deep in the antiferromagnetic regime $\Delta\gg 1$ through scrutinizing the adjacent gap ratios, accompanied by a striking banding of eigenstates by domain-wall number in correlation and entanglement measures. The Page-like entanglement dome characteristic of chaotic spectra gives way to suppressed, band-resolved entanglement consistent with emergent quasi-conservation of domain walls. To investigate further the formation mechanism of mesonic scar states, we carry out meson spectroscopy near the two-spinon threshold and compare with the analytic ladder predicted by Rutkevich [Phys. Rev. B 106, 134405 (2022)]. We test the theory through continuum-relative bindings, an offset-removed Airy scaling collapse, and explicit two-meson thresholds that determine the number of stable meson levels. The low-lying spectrum shows close quantitative agreement, while deviations at higher energies are consistent with finite-size and subleading corrections. These results establish a unified account of confinement-induced nonergodicity and provide a template for quantitative meson spectroscopy in quantum spin chains.</p>

            <h2>Tuning of exciton type by environmental screening</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor L. C. Lima, M. V. Milošević, F. M. Peeters, Andrey Chaves</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the binding energy and electron-hole (e-h) overlap of excitonic states confined at the interface between two-dimensional materials with type-II band alignment, i.e., with lowest conduction and highest valence band edges placed in different materials, arranged in a side-by-side planar heterostructure. We propose a variational procedure within the effective mass approximation to calculate the exciton ground state and apply our model to a monolayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ heterostructure. The role of nonabrupt interfaces between the materials is accounted for in our model by assuming a W$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloy around the interfacial region. Our results demonstrate that (i) interface-bound excitons are energetically favorable only for small interface thickness and/or for systems under high dielectric screening by the materials surrounding the monolayer, and that (ii) the interface exciton binding energy and its e-h overlap are controllable by the interface width and dielectric environment.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling additional quantum many-body scars of the spin-$1$ $XY$ model with Fock-space cages and commutant algebras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sashikanta Mohapatra, Sanjay Moudgalya, Ajit C. Balram</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Transport Spectroscopy of Pseudomagnetic Field in Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Divya Sahani, Sunit Das, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Amit Agarwal, Aveek Bid</p>
            <p>Nonuniform strain in graphene acts as a valley-dependent gauge field, generating pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) that mimic real magnetic fields but preserve global time-reversal symmetry. While local probes have visualized such fields, their quantitative detection via macroscopic transport has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that high-mobility graphene exhibits distinct beating patterns in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, arising from valley-resolved Landau quantization under different effective magnetic fields. Systematic analysis of these beats reveals universal quadratic and linear scaling of the node carrier density and Landau level filling factor with the applied magnetic field, enabling the extraction of PMFs as small as a few millitesla. Our results establish quantum oscillation spectroscopy as a robust and broadly applicable probe of strain-induced gauge fields in Dirac materials, opening avenues for mechanically tunable valleytronic and straintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Spin-lattice coupling induced chiral phonons and their signature in Raman Circular Dichroism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduard Koller, Swetlana Swarup, Johannes Knolle, Natalia B. Perkins</p>
            <p>Recent Raman experiments on the Kitaev material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have reported a finite Raman circular dichroism (RCD), revealing chiral phonon behaviour not expected from lattice symmetry alone. To explain this observation, we develop a diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model. We demonstrate that bare phonons contribute no RCD, but coupling to the chiral spin excitation continuum under an applied magnetic field renormalizes the phonon propagator, mixing real polarization eigenvectors into complex superpositions with finite angular momentum. This interaction-induced modification generates a nonzero RCD accompanied by characteristic Fano line shapes in the Raman response, reflecting interference between discrete phonons and the continuum. The resulting signal grows with magnetic field strength, consistent with experiment, and directly tracks the field-induced chirality of the spin sector. More broadly, our results establish RCD as a powerful probe of interaction-induced chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Photoemission tomography of excitons in 2D systems: momentum-space signatures of correlated electron-hole wave functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siegfried Kaidisch, Amir Kleiner, Sivan Refaely-Abramson, Peter Puschnig, Christian S. Kern</p>
            <p>The momentum-space signatures of excitons can be experimentally accessed through time-resolved (pump-probe) photoelectron spectroscopy. In this work, we develop a computational framework for exciton photoemission orbital tomography (exPOT) in periodic systems, enabling the simulation and interpretation of experimental observables within many-body perturbation theory. By connecting the $GW$+Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) approach to photoemission tomography, our formalism captures exciton photoemission in periodic systems, explicitly incorporating photoemission matrix element effects induced by the probe pulse. The correlated nature of electrons and holes introduces distinct consequences for excitonic photoemission, including a dependence on pump pulse polarization. Using the prototypical two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride, we demonstrate these effects and show how our framework extends to excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum, making it well-suited to studying momentum-dark excitons. This provides valuable insights into the microscopic nature of excitonic phenomena in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Spin-quenching in molecule-transition-metal-dichalcogenide heterostructure through inverse proximity effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swagata Acharya, Dimitar Pashov, Daphne Lubert-Perquel, Mark van Schilfgaarde, Justin C. Johnson</p>
            <p>A functional heterostructure is central to integrated circuitry in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, neuromorphic computing, spintronics, and straintronics. Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.</p>

            <h2>Integrating Atomic Scale Catalyst Design with Transport Engineering for Stable and Efficient CO2 Electrolysis to CO in a Membrane Electrode Assembly</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zahra Teimouri, Mahtab Masouminia, Ashkan Irannezhad, Reza Eslami, Joseph Deering, Navid Noor, Shunquan Tan, Amirhossein Foroozan, Shayan Angizi, Sung-Fu Hun, Drew Higgins</p>
            <p>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) offers a promising approach to decarbonize chemical manufacturing through production of carbon-neutral fuels. However, insufficient performance and instability of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors limit commercial viability, with both metrics directly impacted by the CO2R catalysts. Here we develop an atomically dispersed nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-NC) catalyst through a scalable synthesis approach using two different carbon supports. When using carbon nanotubes as the support, the resulting Ni-NCNT electrode achieves a partial current density toward CO of 558 mA cm-2 with 92 percent Faradaic efficiency toward CO at a cell voltage of 3.2 V and an energy efficiency of 39 percent toward CO at a total current density of 607 mA cm-2. The MEA demonstrates stable operation at 100 mA cm-2 over 210 hours, outperforming previously reported Ni-NC catalysts. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography illustrates the key role of catalyst support on the performance of the electrode. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations using 3D reconstructed images of the catalyst layers from FIB-SEM tomography demonstrate that the higher CO2R performance of the Ni-NCNT electrode is due to improved CO2 diffusion and a more uniform current-density distribution compared to the Ni-NCB electrode prepared with carbon black as the support. The stability and performance of the Ni-NCNT compare favorably to state-of-the-art Ag-based catalysts, while bottom-up cost analysis estimates the purchase cost of the Ni-NCNT catalyst to be about 589 USD per kg, substantially lower than the 1900 USD per kg estimated for Ag-based catalysts.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing entanglement at finite temperature: how does a "classical" paramagnet become a quantum spin liquid?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Snigdh Sabharwal, Matthias Gohlke, Paul Skrzypczyk, Nic Shannon</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.</p>

            <h2>Photoinduced topological phase transition in monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Mortezaei Nobahari</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonequilibrium topological phases of monolayer 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ under high-frequency circularly polarized driving using a low-energy $k\!\cdot\!p$ Hamiltonian combined with a van Vleck expansion. The off-resonant field generates spin- and valley-dependent mass corrections that reshape the Berry curvature profile and shift the conditions for band inversion. By evaluating the quasienergy bands, Berry curvatures, Hall conductivities, and spin- valley-resolved Chern numbers, we identify a sequence of light-controlled topological transitions marked by well-defined gap closings. Depending on the Floquet coupling strength and the electric-field parameter, the system evolves between the equilibrium quantum spin Hall (QSH) state and a set of driven phases including spin-polarized quantum Hall insulator (S-QHI), quantum valley Hall (QVH or BI) and photo-induced quantum Hall insulator (P-QHI) regimes. The results establish 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ as a tunable platform where circular driving selectively manipulates spin and valley degrees of freedom, enabling controlled access to non-equilibrium topological phases in transition-metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <h2>Shaping the aggregates of discotic particles with directional pair interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Martínez-Haya, N. Morillo, A. Cuetos</p>
            <p>Aggregation processes in systems of planar macromolecules and colloids drive a broad range of phenomena in natural systems and soft materials. Depending on chemical architecture, intermolecular interactions in these systems may favor different relative pair orientations, such as stacking face-face or percolating edge-edge arrangements. In this work, we employ a versatile coarse-grained interaction model for disk-like particles to provide a general framework to rationalize the thermotropic formation of aggregates and predict the topology of the resulting suprastructures. Monte Carlo and Brownian Dynamics simulations show that, with an appropriate tuning of the interactions, discotics spontaneously nucleate into clusters with globular, planar or stacked geometries, leading to materials with specific internal order and associated physicochemical properties.</p>

            <h2>Spinon excitations and spin correlations in the one-dimensional quantum magnet $β$-VOSO$_4$ probed by Raman spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dirk Wulferding, Diana Lucia Quintero-Castro, Pontus Laurell, Gonzalo Alvarez, Elbio Dagotto, Kwang-Yong Choi</p>
            <p>Fractionalized excitations such as spinons and anyons have emerged as a central theme in condensed matter physics with broad implications for superconductivity, quantum statistics, and quantum computation. The nearly ideal one-dimensional $S=1/2$ system $\beta$-VOSO$_4$ without long-range order down to 85 mK provides a promising platform to experimentally explore such fractionalized excitations. Here, we employ Raman spectroscopy to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in $\beta$-VOSO$_4$. Spinon signatures are found along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the spinon spectral weight aligns considerably with numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations. By comparing the experimental spinon spectral weight with calculated results and evaluating the associated quantum Fisher information (QFI) therefrom, we observe a steep increase in QFI upon cooling, indicating rapidly growing correlation lengths. Our study showcases QFI as a probe of spin correlations in quantum magnets.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of correlated electronic states of La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu-Hong Tang, Han-Yu Wang, Da-Yong Liu, Feng Lu, Wei-Hua Wang, H.-Q. Lin, Liang-Jian Zou</p>
            <p>We elucidate the electronic structure and quantum many-body instabilities of the monolayer nickelate La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure using a combination of density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), and random phase approximation (RPA). Our DFT+DMFT calculations reveal non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, driven by strong electron correlations within the Ni-e_g orbital manifold, which is analogous to the low-energy electronic properties observed in La3Ni2O7. However, multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis demonstrates an exceptionally suppressed critical Stoner parameter U_c (about 0.4~0.7 eV), indicating robust magnetic order that dominates the ground state and precludes superconductivity in the pristine system. Below U_c, superconducting instabilities exhibit a pressure-driven symmetry transition: the d_(x2-y2)-wave pairing prevails at ambient and low pressure, while the s+g-wave symmetry occurs above 75 GPa. This transition is attributed to pressure-induced self-doping effect. The high-angular-momentum g-wave component incurs significant energetic penalties, rendering high-Tc superconductivity unlikely. We conclude that the absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 arises from its robust intrinsic magnetism and the unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting that alternative routes-such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain-are necessary to suppress magnetism and unlock superconducting states.</p>

            <h2>Interplay of spin-orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field enhances superconductivity in $LaAlO_3/KTaO_3$ (111)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long Cheng, Jia Liu, Tongying Liu, Pan Chen, Mingyue Zhang, Jiashi Li, Shiyu Zhang, Fei Ye, Qing Wang, Weitao Liu, Jian Kang, Jiandi Zhang, Xiaofang Zhai</p>
            <p>In conventional superconductors, bulk physical properties typically degrade as the film thickness approaches the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here in the (111) oriented LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) heterostructure, we demonstrate experimental evidence that reducing the conducting layer thickness at the interface significantly enhances superconducting transition temperature Tc, in direct contrast to conventional wisdom. From the sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and superconducting upper-critical field measurements, both the trigonal symmetry and spin orbit scattering are enhanced with the increased Tc. We attribute the enhanced superconductivity (SC) to the synergic interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and trigonal crystal field, resulting in an enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show the existence of unconventional SC: the approaching linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance with increasing Tc and the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) near the superconducting phase. Our findings provide important insight into the underlying mechanism of the strong orientation-dependent KTO interface SC.</p>

            <h2>Light Induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Cubic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debabrata Sinha</p>
            <p>We investigate topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional electron system with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling driven by circularly polarized light. Within the Floquet framework, we demonstrate that light-matter interaction induces nontrivial band topology characterized by a quantized anomalous Hall response, with Chern insulating phases of C = 0, 1, and 3. These transitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light. Introducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space without modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains topologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are finite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter windows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic Rashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling strengths. These results clarify the interplay between distinct spin-orbit interactions in Floquet-engineered Chern insulators and offer experimentally relevant pathways for achieving light-controlled topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Quantum sensing of time-dependent magnetic signals with molecular spins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Lanza, C. Bonizzoni, O. Mironova, F. Santanni, A. Nicolini, A. Ghirri, A. Cornia, M. Affronte</p>
            <p>Molecular spins offer a promising platform for quantum sensing, particularly in organic, supramolecular or biological environments.. Recognition of the signals by these systems is of particular interest, given their possible integration into more complex structures and their possible use as sensors in close proximity to analytes. In this work, we develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between different time-dependent magnetic field, without requiring its periodicity or specific matching conditions with the microwave manipulating sequence. These are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and VOPt(SOCPh$)_{4}$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO microwave resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to a few $10^{-7}$ T Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $10^{-8}$ T Hz$^{-\frac{1}{2}}$) for signals with duration of a few microseconds. Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.</p>

            <p>Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and $\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent. These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling relation $\lambda=d-2\Theta$.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Misfit and Threading Dislocations on Surface Energies of PbTe-PbSe Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emir Bilgili, Nicholas Taormina, Yang Li, Adrian Diaz, Simon R. Phillpot, Youping Chen</p>
            <p>This work quantifies the effect of misfit and threading dislocations on the surface (interfacial) energies of PbTe-PbSe interfaces, with the defect structures of the interfaces being obtained from atomistic and multiscale simulations of their manufacturing processes. Simulation results show that direct bonding produces semi-coherent interfaces with two-dimensional misfit dislocation networks, while heteroepitaxial processes produce complex three-dimensional dislocation structures with both misfit and threading dislocations. Surface energies at these interfaces were determined by computing the interaction energies across these interfaces. Compared with coherent interfaces, directly bonded interfaces exhibit up to ~23% lower surface energy, while the surface energies of epitaxially grown interfaces can be nearly 50% lower. The results demonstrate the significant effects of dislocations, which are unavoidable during the manufacturing processes of lattice mismatched heterostructures, on surface (interfacial) energy.</p>

            <h2>Hyperelastic stability landscape: A check for HILL stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelasticity depending on material parameters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Herbert Baaser</p>
            <p>In this paper, we describe a uniform and standardized approach for analytically verifying the stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material models. Here, we address stability as fulfillment of the Hill's condition - i.e. the positive definiteness of the material modulus in the Kirchhoff stress - log-strain relation. For incompressible material behavior, all mathematically and mechanically possible deformations lie within a range bounded, on the one hand, by uniaxial states and, on the other hand, by biaxial states; shear {deformation} states lie in between. This becomes particularly clear when the possible states are represented in the invariant plane. This very representation is now also used to visualize the regions of unstable material behavior depending on the selected strain energy function and the respective data set of material parameters. This demonstrates how, for some constellations of energy functions, with appropriate selection or calibration of parameters, stable and unstable regions can be observed. If such cases occur, it is no longer legitimate to use them to initiate, for example, finite element simulations. This is particularly striking when, for example, a fit appears stable in uniaxial tension, but the same parameter set for shear states results in unstable behavior without this being specifically investigated. The presented approach can reveal simple indicators for this.</p>

            <p>We perform cell segmentation on images from experimental studies of confluent, mobile cells in epithelial monolayers and show that these systems possess a broad, positively-skewed shape parameter distribution $P(\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}=p^2/4\pi a$, $p$ is the perimeter, and $a$ is area of each cell. $P(\mathcal{A})$ is peaked at a value higher than the typical shape parameter $\mathcal{A}^* \sim 1.15$ that occurs for randomly packed, static confluent cell monolayers. The distribution does not arise from a heterogeneous population of cells with different fixed $\mathcal{A}$, nor can it arise from cell shape fluctuations from strains below the elastic limit. Instead, we find that all cells in each monolayer sample $\mathcal{A}$ values that span the full shape parameter distribution. We develop a deformable particle model that allows cell perimeter to adapt to local forces during cell motion, and this model recovers $P(\mathcal{A})$ to within $5\%$ for both MDCK and HaCaT epithelial cell monolayers. These results emphasize that confluent epithelial monolayers of mobile cells generate a well-defined broad shape parameter distribution that is independent of the initial cell shapes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommaso Comparin, Fabio Mezzacapo, Martin Robert-de-Saint-Vincent, Tommaso Roscilde</p>
            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is a property of Hamiltonian equilibrium states which, in the thermodynamic limit, retain a finite average value of an order parameter even after a field coupled to it is adiabatically turned off. In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of the symmetry generator -- namely, the collective spin component along an axis of symmetry. In systems of $S=1/2$ spins or qubits, the combination of the suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing -- a much sought-after property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of XXZ models spontaneously breaking a U(1) (or even SU(2)) symmetry, we show that the adiabatically prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as $N^{-3/4}$ with the number of spins $N$; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic preparation time scaling linearly with $N$. Our findings open the door to the adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of quantum many-body devices including e.g. optical lattice clocks.</p>

            <h2>The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Takanami, Takashi Takahashi, Ayaka Sakata</p>
            <p>Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model improves itself using its own predictions, has attracted attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD with a linear classifier for binary classification on noisy Gaussian mixture data. For the analysis, we employ the replica method from statistical physics. Our findings reveal that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also identify two practical heuristics to enhance SD: early stopping that limits the number of stages, which is broadly effective, and bias parameter fixing, which helps under label imbalance. To empirically validate our theoretical findings derived from our toy model, we conduct additional experiments on CIFAR-10 classification using pretrained ResNet backbone. These results provide both theoretical and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</h2>

            <p>Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics cause decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, primarily based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and measure defects only within narrow frequency bands and limited mode volumes, restricting insight into TLS behavior in isolated materials and interfaces. We introduce Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS), a broadband 3D waveguide technique that enables probing of TLS ensembles at cryogenic temperatures. Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands in TLS ensembles. The broadband, power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it well suited for studying dressed-state physics in driven TLS ensembles, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. By analyzing Fourier-transformed time-domain signals, BCTDS reveals eigen-mode frequencies of undriven TLS ensembles through characteristic V-shaped features and uncovers memory effects arising from interactions and broadband excitation. The modular method can be applied throughout device fabrication, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</p>

            <h2>Rotational Jamming of Plasmonic Optical Matter Driven by Chiral Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutosh Shukla, Sneha Boby, Rahul Chand, G. V. Pavan Kumar</p>
            <p>Plasmonic Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $\alpha$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $\alpha$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $\alpha$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $\alpha$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $\alpha$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.</p>

            <h2>Screw-dislocation-engineered quantum dot: geometry-tunable nonlinear optics, orbital qubit addressability, and torsion metrology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.</p>

            <h2>Current-driven switching of topological spin chirality in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Xuan Zhang, Seungbok Lee, Woonghee Cho, Je-Geun Park</p>
            <p>Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.</p>

            <p>Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.</p>

            <h2>Stationary inverse-Wishart polymers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Barraquand, Zikun Ouyang</p>
            <p>A solvable model of directed polymer with matrix-valued disorder is introduced in arXiv:2203.14868. The disorder is made of $d\times d$ inverse-Wishart random matrices, so that the model nicely generalizes the well-studied log-gamma polymer, recovered when $d=1$. Much of the features of the log-gamma polymer seem to have analogues for higher $d$, although the integrability needs to be better understood. In this paper, we introduce stationary inverse-Wishart polymer models on a quadrant or a strip of $\mathbb Z^2$. In each setting, we identify stationary measures, characterized explicitly in terms of random walks with inverse-Wishart increments in special cases, or more complicated two-layer Gibbs measures for generic choices of boundary parameters. We also make conjectures about asymptotics of the free energy, and explain important differences between matrix-valued polymer models and their scalar counterpart, due to non-commutativity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrey Okhotin, Maksim Nakhodnov, Nikita Kazeev, Andrey E Ustyuzhanin, Dmitry Vetrov</p>
            <p>In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

            <h2>Reflectivity-based refractive index measurement of van der Waals materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier Zambrana-Puyalto, Alexander Johan Olsen, Søren Raza</p>
            <p>We present a reflectivity-based method for measuring the in-plane refractive index of transparent van der Waals (vdW) materials. The approach enables the characterization of as small as $3 \times 3$~{\textmu}m$^2$ exfoliated flakes on a non-transmissive substrate without assuming any specific spectral shape of the refractive index. Exfoliated flakes are most commonly obtained through mechanical exfoliation, which generally produces vdW flakes with tens-of-micron lateral dimensions. As a result, conventional ellipsometry - which depends on large, uniform areas and specific spectral models - becomes challenging to apply. Our method determines the refractive index directly from the spectral position of reflectivity minima, provided the flake thickness and the substrate complex refractive index are known. We demonstrate the technique on hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), a vdW semiconductor with high refractive index and low absorption, retrieving its in-plane refractive index across the visible range. The results both validate previous ellipsometry measurements and establish this method as an accessible and spectral-model-free alternative for refractive index characterization of vdW materials.</p>

By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension.

            <p>We introduce and systematically investigate the generation of dispersive shock waves, which arise naturally in physical settings such as optical waveguide arrays and superfluids confined within optical lattices. The underlying physically relevant model is a nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation with a periodic potential. We consider the evolution of piecewise smooth initial data composed of two distinct nonlinear periodic eigenmodes. To begin interpreting the resulting wave dynamics, we employ the tight-binding approximation, reducing the continuous system to a discrete NLS (DNLS) model with piecewise constant initial data (i.e., a Riemann problem), where each constant state represents a discrete Floquet-Bloch mode at the continuum model level. The resulting tight-binding approximation is shown to display higher-fidelity for {deeper} periodic potentials. This reduced DNLS model effectively models the dynamics at the minima of the periodic potential of the original continuum NLS. Within such a single-band DNLS framework, we apply tools from Whitham modulation theory and long-wave quasi-continuum reductions to uncover and analyze a rich spectrum of non-convex, discrete dispersive hydrodynamic phenomena, comparing the resulting phenomenology with that of the periodic-potential-bearing continuum model.</p>

We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Zhang, Matthew Otten</p>
            <p>Accurate quantum many-body calculations often depend on reliable reference states or good human-designed ansätze, yet these sources of knowledge can become unreliable in hard problems like strongly correlated systems. We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours. For the nitrogenase P-cluster, it matches selected-CI accuracy using $10^5$-fold fewer determinants. For $8\times8$ Hubbard model, it recovers over $99\%$ of the ground-state energy using only $10^{-28}$ of the Hilbert space. In some regimes, TrimCI attains orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than AFQMC method. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy many-body ground states can be discovered directly from random determinants, establishing TrimCI as a prior-knowledge-free, accurate and highly efficient framework for quantum many-body systems. The compact explicit wavefunctions it produces further enable direct and rapid evaluation of observables.</p>

            <p>Angular momentum conservation influences equilibrium statistical mechanics, leading to a generalized microcanonical density for an isolated system and a generalized Gibbs density for a weakly coupled system. We study the stochastic decay of angular momentum due to weakly imperfect rotational symmetry of the external potential that confines the isolated many-particle system. We present a mesoscopic description of the system, deriving Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations, which are consistent with equilibrium statistical mechanics when rotational symmetry is maintained. When the symmetry is weakly violated, we formulate a coarse-grained stochastic differential equation governing the decay of total angular momentum over time. To validate our analytical predictions, we conduct numerical simulations of the microcanonical ensemble, an isolated system undergoing thermalization due to weak two-body interactions. Our coarse-grained Langevin equation accurately characterizes both the decay of the angular momentum and its fluctuations in a steady state. Furthermore, we estimate the parameters of our mesoscopic model directly from simulations, providing insights into the dissipative phenomenological coefficients, such as friction. More generally, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of the integrals of motion when the corresponding symmetry is weakly violated.</p>

While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladislav Chertenkov, Lev Shchur</p>
            <p>The main question raised in the article is whether a neural network trained on a spin lattice model in one universality class can be used to test a model in another universality class. The quantities of interest are the critical phase transition temperature and the correlation length exponent. In other words, the question of transfer learning is how ``universal'' the trained network is and under what conditions. For this purpose, we applied a supervised learning procedure to three two-dimensional models for which critical properties are precisely known: the Ising model, the four-state Potts model, and the Baxter-Wu model. We consider two datasets: one with spins configurations and one with binding energy configurations. We find that estimates of the critical temperature agree well with the known results for both datasets, but not with the results of cross-testing using the energy datasets of the two models: the four-state Potts model and the Ising model. Estimates of the critical length exponent are less regular, and appear to be more accurate for energy datasets. A good example is the cross-testing using the energy dataset between Ising model and Baxter-Wu model in both training and testing directions.12</p>

            <p>Combinatorial materials libraries provide a powerful platform for mapping how physical properties evolve across binary and ternary cross-sections of multicomponent phase diagrams. While synthesis of such libraries has advanced since the 1960s and been accelerated by laboratory automation, their broader utility depends on rapid, quantitative measurements of composition-dependent structures and functionalities. Scanning probe microscopies (SPM), including piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), offer unique potential for providing these functionally relevant, spatially resolved readouts. Here, we demonstrate a fully automated SPM framework for exploring ferroelectric properties across combinatorial libraries, focusing on binary Sm-doped BiFeO3 (SmBFO) and ternary Al$_{1-x-y}$Sc$_x$B$_y$N (Al,Sc,B)N systems. In SmBFO, automated exploration identifies the known morphotropic phase boundary with enhanced ferroelectric response and reveals a previously unreported double-peak fine structure. In the (Al,Sc,B)N library, ferroelectric behavior emerges at the phase-stability boundary, correlating with variations in morphology and defect concentration. By integrating automated SPM with wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) and photoluminescence mapping, we resolve the composition-morphology-defect-property relationships underlying ferroelectric response and demonstrate a pathway toward a multi-tool, high-throughput characterization platform. Finally, we implement Gaussian-process-based single- and multi-objective Bayesian optimization to enable autonomous exploration, highlighting the Pareto front as a powerful framework for balancing competing physical rewards and accelerating data-driven physics discovery.</p>

            <h2>A real-time approach to frequency-mixing spectroscopies: application to sum and difference frequency generation in two-dimensional crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mike N. Pionteck, Myrta Grüning, Simone Sanna, Claudio Attaccalite</p>
            <p>We propose a computational framework to extract non-linear response functions from real-time simulations in the presence of more than one external field. We apply this approach to the calculation of sum frequency generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG). SFG and DFG are second-order nonlinear processes where two lasers with frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ combine to produce a response at frequency $\omega = \omega_1 \pm \omega_2$. Compared with other nonlinear responses such as second-harmonic generation, SFG and DFG allow for tunability over a larger range. Moreover, the optical response can be enhanced by selecting the two laser frequencies in order to match specific electron-hole transitions. To assess the approach, we calculate the SFG and DFG of two-dimensional crystals, hBN and MoS2 monolayers, from real-time solution of an effective Schrödinger equation. Within the effective Schrödinger equation, one can select from various levels of theory for the effective one-particle Hamiltonian to account for local-field effects and electron-hole interactions. We compare results obtained within the independent-particle picture and including many-body effects. Such comparison allows us to identify and characterize excitonic features in the obtained spectra. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can also extract higher-order response functions, such as field-induced second-harmonic generation. We provide an example using the hBN bilayer.</p>

            <p>Magnetic materials represent an essential ingredient for the contemporary industry. Apart from common material parameters such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy, coercivity, or saturation magnetization, magnetoelastic behavior is vital for applications serving in various devices, e.g., in acoustic actuators, transducers, or sensors providing a desirable fast response and high efficiency with respect to applied magnetic field. Magnetoelastic properties have been studied for ferromagnetic 3d elements, or especially in high symmetry systems containing rare-earth elements to achieve higher values. Since, unlike for rare earth Laves phases, in the transition metals or alloys, these effects are very weak. Here, in contrast, we analyze the magnetoelastic behavior of antiferromagnetic tetragonal system MnPt, explaining the experimentally measured data based on the theoretical calculations and discussing the influence of the magnetic structure. Particularly, we inspect the origin of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, as well as the size and source of the isotropic and anisotropic parts of magnetoelastic (magnetostriction) coefficients.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luhang Yang, Elbio Dagotto, Adrian E. Feiguin</p>
            <p>We numerically investigate the telltale signs of pair-density-wave order (PDW) in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain by focusing on the momentum resolved spectrum in different parameter regimes. Density matrix renormalization group calculations reveal that this phase is characterized by a dispersion with two minima and four Fermi points, indicating the emergence of an effective next-nearest-neighbor hopping that arises as a second-order effect to avoid magnetic frustration. The pairs appear in the spectrum as in-gap bound states with weight concentrated in the hole pockets. The low-energy physics can be understood by means of a generalized t-J model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results offer a guide for searching for experimental signatures, and for other models that can realize PDW physics.</p>

            <p>The electronic and optical properties of self-trapped holes in kappa-phase orthorhombic Ga2O3 in conjunction with isoelectronic and acceptor dopants were studied using hybrid density functional theory. Hole trapping was found to be energetically favorable in all systems investigated and was further stabilized by acceptor dopants with large ionization energies. The electronic structures revealed emergent states in the band gap ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 eV above the valence band maximum, primarily composed of O 2p orbitals in all cases, with a notable contribution from Zn 3d orbitals in the Zn-doped system. Hole trapping resulted in a pronounced red shift and the emergence of additional absorption peaks, producing optical characteristics that were in closer agreement with experimental observations. In each system, the trapped hole localized near the dopant atom, predominantly on adjacent O atoms, accompanied by local lattice distortions. The valence band remained largely non-dispersive even in the presence of a hole; hole states lied near the Fermi level for isoelectronic dopants and deeper in the band gap for acceptor dopants. These findings indicate that isoelectronic doping may find an avenue for p-type doping in this polymorph of Ga2O3 if a means to mitigate self-compensation is found.</p>

            <p>The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagomé bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagomé bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagomé as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</p>

            <p>Using functional methods, we investigate the sound quanta arising from quantized hydrodynamic fields in simple liquids at low temperatures, under the influence of high-energy processes, coming from non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. To model these effects on the hydrodynamic fields, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive, delta-correlated (in space and time) quantum noise field. Thus, the hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, called the configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. This formalism allow us to obtain the excitation spectra of liquids. In the liquid, each term of the series describes the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momenta space. Finally, the behavior of the constant volume specific heat as a function of temperature is obtained for different simple liquids.</p>

            <h2>Critical Non-Hermitian Edge Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunling Zhou, Zihe Yang, Bowen Zeng, Yong Hu</p>
            <p>We unveil a unique critical phenomenon of topological edge modes in non-Hermitian systems, dubbed the critical non-Hermitian edge modes (CNHEM). Specifically, in the thermodynamic limit, the eigenvectors of edge modes jump discontinuously under infinitesimal on-site staggered perturbations. The CNHEM arises from the competition between the introduced on-site staggered potentials and size-dependent non-reciprocal coupling between edge modes, and are closely connected to the exceptional point (EP). As the system size increases, the coupling between edge modes decreases while the non-reciprocity is enhanced, causing the eigenvectors to gradually collapse toward the EP. However, when the on-site potentials dominate, this weakened coupling assists the eigenvectors to stay away from the EP. Such a critical phenomenon is absent in Hermitian systems, where the coupling between edge modes is reciprocal.</p>

            <p>First-principles calculations rely heavily on pseudopotentials, yet their impact on accuracy is hardly addressed. In this work, we show that most pseudopotentials to date introduce errors, which manifest themselves as errors of atomic energy levels, leading to a $de facto$ deviation from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. We consider the atomic-level adjusted pseudopotentials, whose interplay with exchange-correlation functional provides a pragmatic correction that balances accuracy and efficiency. We benchmark our theory with bandgap calculation for 54 semiconductors containing monovalent Cu. The results, compared to those from conventional studies, not only remove all erroneous metal predictions for 11 compounds, but also reduce the mean relative error from 80\% to 20\%. Overall accuracy even exceeds those of standard hybrid functionals and GW methods.</p>

            <h2>A Unifying Framework for Fractional Chern Insulator Stabilization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peleg Emanuel, Anna Keselman, Yuval Oreg</p>
            <p>We present a theory of fractional Chern insulator stabilization against charge-ordered states. We argue that the phase competition is captured by an effective interaction range, which depends on both the bare interaction range and quantum geometric properties. We argue that short effective interaction ranges stabilize fractional states while longer-range interactions favor charge-ordered states. To confirm our hypothesis, we conduct a numerical study of the generalized Hofstadter model using the density matrix renormalization group. Our theory offers a new interpretation of the geometric stability hypothesis and generalizes it, providing a unifying framework for several approaches to fractional phase stabilization. Finally, we propose a route towards experimental verification of the theory and possible implications for fractional states in bands with higher Chern numbers.</p>

            <p>Bestowing CMOS-compatible binary oxides with additional functionalities is a powerful strategy toward the realization of oxide electronics. Ideal candidates are thin films which display a strong sensitivity to strain, chemical doping or nanoscale confinement. Among these, crystalline tungsten trioxide WO3 exhibits exceptional structural flexibility, enabling a wide range of functionalities. Here, we reveal the emergence of a previously unreported polar phase in epitaxial WO3 thin films. We accomplish this by imposing epitaxial shear strain, which stabilizes a low-symmetry triclinic structure that persists up to large film thicknesses and elevated temperatures. At the atomic scale, a change in the oxygen octahedral tilt pattern facilitates this symmetry lowering into a polar phase, which manifests as a periodic in-plane polarized stripe domain configuration with needle-like bifurcations at the microscale. The stripe domain walls further exhibit a strongly enhanced electrical conductivity in conjunction with a pronounced reduction of a distortive structural mode, providing the first experimental evidence for the formation of anti-distortive polarons recently predicted in WO3.</p>

            <p>The intertwining of multiple order parameters is a widespread phenomenon in equilibrium condensed matter systems, yet its exploration is often hindered by the complexity of real materials. Here, we present a controlled study of intertwined orders in a minimal and versatile driven-dissipative quantum-engineered platform. We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate at the intersection of two optical cavities, realizing two competing copies of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking superradiant phase transition characterized by density wave orders. Using periodic drives that exploit dynamical symmetry reduction, we show that collective excitations can be harnessed to stabilize a variety of novel intertwined orders. Going beyond the conventional phenomenology involving Landau orders, we show the emergence of a larger class of out-of-equilibrium intertwined phases, including intertwining of purely time-crystalline orders, as well as between Landau and time crystal orders. These results should be observable in state of the art experimental setups.</p>

            <p>BaCd2P2 (BCP) has been recently identified as a new solar absorber with promising optoelectronic properties. This work demonstrates that, despite having a low precursor purity (98.90% to 99.95%), synthesized BCP samples exhibit promising photoconductive carrier lifetime up to 300 ns and an implied open circuit voltage exceeding 1 V, comparable to a high-purity single-crystalline GaAs wafer. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the promising properties of BCP, its tolerance to intrinsic defects and extrinsic impurities is investigated using first-principles defect modeling and compared with the well-studied GaAs. The results show that the nonradiative recombination rates induced by dominant deep-level intrinsic antisite defects are lower in BCP than in GaAs under typical growth conditions. Further exploration of the impact of transition metal impurities in the raw materials used to make BCP and impurities introduced during its synthesis shows that most of these do not form deep-level nonradiative recombination centers. As an impurity-tolerant counterpart of GaAs, BCP demonstrates great potentials to improve the cost to performance ratio of photovoltaics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young Sul Cho</p>
            <p>Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.</p>

            <h2>System-Bath Approach to Rotating Brownian Motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashot Matevosyan, Armen E. Allahverdyan</p>
            <p>Rotating equilibrated systems are widespread, but relatively little attention has been devoted to studying them from the first principles of statistical mechanics. We fill this gap by studying a Brownian particle coupled with a thermal bath made of rotating harmonic oscillators. We show that the Langevin equation that describes the dynamics of the Brownian particle contains (due to rotation) long-range correlated noise. In contrast to the usual situation of (non-rotating) equilibration, the rotating Gibbs distribution is recovered only for a weak coupling with the bath. In the presence of a uniform magnetic field, the stationary state is not Gibbsian, even under weak coupling. In this context, we clarify the applicability of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem to classical systems in rotating equilibrium, as well as the concept of work done by a changing magnetic field. We show that the Brownian particle under a rotationally symmetric potential reaches a stationary state that behaves as an effective equilibrium, characterized by a free energy. As a result, no work can be extracted via cyclic processes that respect the rotation symmetry. However, if the external potential exhibits asymmetry, then work extraction via slow cyclic processes is possible. This is illustrated by a general scenario involving a slow rotation of a non-rotation-symmetric potential. We study sedimentation equilibrium and show that centrifugal instability is prevented by a finite friction.</p>

            <p>The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\sqrt{3}$$\times$$\sqrt{3}$)R30° and (2$\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strongly oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.</p>

            <p>This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julien Bauland, Thomas Gibaud</p>
            <p>In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to developing smart materials whose mechanical properties can adapt under physical stimuli. Particulate colloidal gels, which behave as solids but can also flow under stress, have emerged as promising candidates. Resulting from the attractive interaction between their constituents, their network architecture exhibit solid-like properties even at very low volume fractions. This structural flexibility allows them to adopt various configurations and store structural information making them highly susceptible to memory effects. Shear flow, applied through rheometry, offers a simple and effective way to tune their properties and imprint a ``rheological memory'' of the flow history. However, the precise relationship between flow history and viscoelastic response remains elusive, largely due to the limited structural characterization of these systems during flow and after flow cessation. Here, we use ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) to reveal a strong structural memory in the solid state, where the microstructure formed under shear is retained after flow cessation. We identify two distinct mechanisms of structural memory, as governed by the ratio of viscous to attractive forces, namely, the Mason number. Using recently developed fractal scaling laws, we show that the rheology is fully determined by the gel microstructure. Notably, these gels exhibit a double-fractal architecture, highlighting the remarkably broad range of length scales over which these disordered materials are structured. By clarifying how memory is encoded, our results offer strategies to tune shear sensitivity of colloidal gels and design smart materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chanju Park (Swansea University), Biagio Lucini (Queen Mary University of London), Gert Aarts (Swansea University)</p>
            <p>Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.</p>

            <p>While the spin ice state of bulk pyrochlores such as $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ and $\rm{Ho_2Ti_2O_7}$ has been extensively studied in the last several decades due to its unique degenerate ground state and emergent monopole excitation, whether it survives in the thin-film form remains a mystery. The limited volume of thin-film sample makes it challenging to study the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, we synthesized 18nm-thick $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film on YSZ (Yttria-stabilized Zirconia with 9.5 mol% $\rm{Y_2O_3}$) substrate and capped it by a thin conductive $\rm{Bi_2Ir_2O_7}$ layer, and performed the proximitized magnetoresistance measurements. Our study found that the ice-rule-breaking phase transition survives but with a modified effective nearest-neighbor interaction ($\rm{J_{eff}}=$ 1.054 K) and distorted Ising spin axes ($\rm{\epsilon}=+0.051)$ compared to the bulk crystal. The results are supported by the simultaneously measured capacitive torque magnetometry. Our study demonstrates that proximitized transport is an effective tool for thin films of insulating frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p>DNA and other biopolymers are being investigated as new computing substrates and alternative to silicon-based digital computers. However, the established top-down design of biomolecular interaction networks remains challenging and does not fully exploit biomolecular self-assembly capabilities. Outside the field of computation, directed evolution has been used as a tool for goal directed optimization of DNA sequences. Here, we propose integrating directed evolution with DNA-based reservoir computing to enable in-material optimization and adaptation. Simulations of colloidal bead networks connected via DNA strands demonstrate a physical reservoir capable of non-linear time-series prediction tasks, including Volterra series and Mackey-Glass chaotic dynamics. Reservoir computing performance, quantified by normalized mean squared error (NMSE), strongly depends on network topology, suggesting task-specific optimal network configurations. Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve DNA-encoded network connectivity effectively identified well-performing reservoir networks. Directed evolution improved reservoir performance across multiple tasks, outperforming random network selection. Remarkably, sequential training on distinct tasks resulted in reservoir populations maintaining performance on prior tasks. Our findings indicate that DNA-bead networks offer sufficient complexity for reservoir computing, and that directed evolution robustly optimizes performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephen W. Lovesey</p>
            <p>Symmetry informed diffraction patterns for magnetically ordered MnF2 illuminated by x-rays tuned in energy to a Mn atomic resonance depend on circular polarization in the primary beam. The change in intensity of a Bragg spot with a change in handedness establishes a chiral signature for the fully compensated collinear antiferromagnet. The signature is calculated for electric dipole (E1) and electric quadrupole (E2) axial absorption events. Polar E1-E2 absorption events are forbidden by inversion symmetry in Wyckoff positions assigned to Mn ions in the established MnF2 magnetic symmetry. It is compatible with atomic altermagnetism, and the corresponding order parameter contributes to E2-E2 and magnetic neutron Bragg diffraction patterns. Moreover, spin-flip patterns from polarized neutron diffraction depend on electronic quadrupole and octupole moments that are zero for the nominal 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, which make them good tests of the actual electronic structure.</p>

            <h2>Constraint correlation functions of the one-dimensional Ising model in the scaling limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Balog, Adam Rançon</p>
            <p>We study the correlation function of the one-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization. Focusing on the scaling limit close to the zero-temperature fixed point, we show that this correlation function, in momentum space, exhibits surprising oscillations as a function of the magnetization. We show that these oscillations have a period inversely proportional to the momentum and give an interpretation in terms of domain walls. This is in sharp contrast with the behavior of the correlation function in constant magnetic fields, and sheds light on recent results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations for the correlation functions of the critical two-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandro Wieser, YuJie Cen, Georg K. H. Madsen, Jesús Carrete</p>
            <p>Atomistic simulations of heat transport in complex materials are costly and hard to converge. This has led to the development of several noise-reduction techniques applicable to equilibrium molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. We analyze the performance of those strategies, taking InAs nanowires as our benchmark due to the diverse structures and complex phonon spectra of these quasi-1D systems. We demonstrate how, for low-thermal-conductivity systems, cepstral analysis can reduce computational demands while still delivering accurate results that do not require discarding arbitrary parts of the dataset. However, issues with this approach are revealed when treating high-thermal-conductivity systems, where the thermal conductivity is significantly underestimated. We discuss alternative methods to be used in that situation, relying on uncertainty propagation from independent simulations. We show that the contributions of the covariance matrix have to be included for a quantitative assessment of the error. The combination of these strategies with machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provides an accelerated, robust workflow applicable to a diverse set of systems, as our examples using a highly transferable MACE potential illustrate.</p>

            <h2>Universality in the velocity jump in the crack propagation observed for food-wrapping films for daily use</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aoi Nohara, Ko Okumura</p>
            <p>The velocity jump found in the crack propagation for rubbers has been a powerful tool for developing tough rubber materials. Although it is suggested by a theory that the jump could be observed widely for viscoelastic materials, the report on a clear jump is very limited and, even in such a case, reproducibility is low, except for elastomers. Here, we use a mundane food-wrapping film as a sample and observe the crack propagation velocity with pulling the sample at a constant speed in the direction perpendicular to the crack. As a result, we find the jump occurs at a critical strain with high reproducibility. Remarkably, the plot of the crack-propagation velocity as a function of strain can be collapsed onto a master curve by an appropriate rescaling, where the master curve is found to be universal for change in the pulling speed and in the sample height. The result reveals a key parameter for the jump is the strain, suggesting the existence of a small length that governs the deformation along the crack. The present study sets limitations on future theories and opens an avenue for the velocity jump to become a tool for developing a wide variety of tough polymer-based materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihao Feng, Christian T. Randolph, Tyler B. Martin, Thomas E. Gartner III</p>
            <p>Polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) theory, a descendent of Ornstein-Zernike liquid state theory, is a powerful tool to predict the structure and thermodynamics of equilibrium polymer systems, but its accuracy and applicability can be limited in some important cases. Typically, these shortcomings are traced to the analytical closure relationships used to solve the integral equations. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based closure relation trained on a dataset of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of homopolymer melts and solutions. PRISM theory with the ML closure outperforms traditional atomic closures (e.g., Percus-Yevick) in predicting the structure of typical coarse-grained model systems. We also use the ML closure to accurately model the results of small-angle neutron scattering experiments. This ML-enhanced PRISM theory can therefore enable rapid soft materials discovery and design efforts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ram Sudhir Sharma, Alexandre Leonelli, Kevin Zhao, Eckart Meiburg, Alban Sauret</p>
            <p>The gravity-driven discharge of granular material through an aperture is a fundamental problem in granular physics and is classically described by empirical laws with different fitting parameters. In this Letter, we disentangle the mass flux into distinct velocity and packing contributions by combining three-dimensional experiments and simulations. We define a dimensionless flux ratio that captures confinement-driven deviations from a free-fall limit, which is recovered when the aperture is large compared to the grain size. For spherical cohesionless grains, the deviations from the free-fall limit are captured by a single exponential correction factor over a characteristic length scale of $\sim$ 10-15 grain diameters. This is shown to be the scale over which the packing structure is modified due to the boundary. Building on the $\sqrt{gD}$ exit-velocity scaling, we propose a kinematic framework that explains the universality of granular discharge beyond empirical descriptions.</p>

            <p>We show that stochastically driven nonequilibrium conserved growth models admit generic strong coupling phases for sufficiently strong nonlocal chemical potentials underlying the dynamics. The models exhibit generic roughening transitions between perturbatively accessible weak coupling phases satisfying an exact relation between the scaling exponents in all dimensions $d$, and strong coupling phases. In dimensions below the critical dimension $d_c$, the latter phases are unstable and argued to be crumpled, and thus distinct from the well-known strong coupling rough phase of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in dimensions $d\geq 2$. At $d_c$, conventional spatio-temporal scaling in the weak coupling phase is logarithmically modulated and are exactly obtained.</p>

            <p>Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators. By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor ($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$ across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12 K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. V. Nikolaev, U. N. Kurelchuk, E. V. Tkalya</p>
            <p>We examine the influence of the relativistic effects within the linear augmented plane wave method (LAPW) with the potential of general shape for solids and suggest a few ways to account them more accurately: (1) we introduce new radial dependencies for LAPW (Bloch-type) basis functions, based on two actual radial solutions of the Dirac equation for j=l-1/2 and j=l+1/2 one-electron states; (2) the canonical LAPW matrix elements for the spherically symmetric component of the potential, assuming non-relativistic radial wave functions, should be corrected; (3) we argue that for a realistic spin-orbit energy splitting of the semicore 6p-states the spin-orbit interaction constant zeta(p) should be calculated with the 6p3/2 radial component; (4) in cases when two j=l +/- 1/2 components are occupied (for example for the 6p states of actinides) the electron density, associated with the small components of valence electrons, can be taken into the calculation scheme. We demonstrate that the new treatment for the relativistic effects is capable to change the equilibrium lattice constant up to 0.15~Å and the bulk modulus up to 26 GPa. We find that the electron density of valence electrons at the nucleus increases by 2.3-4.3 times due to the inclusion of small components, which can be essential for precise description of the potential and density close to the nuclear region, important for nuclear spectroscopies. In contrast to the common believe that in plain band structure treatment UO2 is a metal, we show that in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling UO2 has a small gap of forbidden states (0.2-0.4 eV) at the Fermi level, where the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied $5f$ bands slightly overlap, as in calculations of the conduction and valence band in solid Ge.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saswata Mandal, Chao-Xing Liu</p>
            <p>Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field, junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.</p>

            <p>Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</p>

            <p>Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.</p>

We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states.</p>

            <h2>Accelerated Prediction of Temperature-Dependent Lattice Thermal Conductivity via Ensembled Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piyush Paliwal, Aftab Alam</p>
            <p>Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $\kappa_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $\kappa_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data obtained from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $\kappa_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $\kappa_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $\kappa_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $\kappa_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler compounds and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $\kappa_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $\kappa_L$ for thermoelectric applications.</p>

            <p>We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo da Silva Souza, Fernando Iemini</p>
            <p>The study of open system dynamics is of paramount importance both from its fundamental aspects as well as from its potential applications in quantum technologies. In the simpler and most commonly studied case, the dynamics of the system can be described by a Lindblad master equation. However, identifying the Lindbladian that leads to general non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) is usually a non-trivial and challenging task. Here we introduce a method for reconstructing the corresponding Lindbaldian master equation given any target NESS, i.e., a \textit{Lindbladian Reverse Engineering} ($\mathcal{L}$RE) approach. The method maps the reconstruction task to a simple linear problem. Specifically, to the diagonalization of a correlation matrix whose elements are NESS observables and whose size scales linearly (at most quadratically) with the number of terms in the Hamiltonian (Lindblad jump operator) ansatz. The kernel (null-space) of the correlation matrix corresponds to Lindbladian solutions. Moreover, the map defines an iff condition for $\mathcal{L}$RE, which works as both a necessary and a sufficient condition; thus, it not only defines, if possible, Lindbladian evolutions leading to the target NESS, but also determines the feasibility of such evolutions in a proposed setup. We illustrate the method in different systems, ranging from bosonic Gaussian systems, dissipative-driven collective spins and random local spin models.</p>

            <p>Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization.

In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) cage is a unique localization phenomenon that confines all possible excitations. This confinement leads to fully flat spectra in momentum space, which are typically accompanied with the degeneracy with various types. Classifying the degeneracy type is crucial for studying the dynamical properties of the non-Hermitian AB cage, but the methods for such classification and their physical connections remain not very clear. Here, we construct a non-Hermitian AB cage in a bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) system with various types of degenerate flat bands (DFBs). Using the transfer matrix, we demonstrate the localization mechanism for the formation of AB cage and derive the minimal polynomial in mathematics for classifying the degeneracy types of DFBs, thus providing comprehensive understanding of the correspondence among the degeneracy type of DFBs, the minimal polynomial, and the transfer matrix. With such correspondence, we propose a scheme to realize highly degenerate flat bands.</p>

            <p>Sensing periodic-fields using quantum sensors has been an active field of research. In many of these scenarios, the quantum state of the probe is flipped regularly by the application of $\pi$-pulses to accumulate information about the target periodic-field. The emergence of a discrete time crystalline phase, as a nonequilibrium phase of matter, naturally provides oscillations in a many-body system with an inherent controllable frequency. They benefit from long coherence time and robustness against imperfections, which makes them excellent potential quantum sensors. In this paper, through theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that a disorder-free discrete time crystal probe can reach the ultimate achievable precision for sensing a periodic-field. As the amplitude of the periodic-field increases, the discrete time crystalline order diminishes, and the performance of the probe decreases remarkably. Nevertheless, the obtained quantum enhancement in the discrete time crystal phase, which is experimentally accessible using standard projective measurements, shows robustness against different imperfections and dephasing noise in the protocol. Finally, we propose the implementation of our protocol in ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.</p>

Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.</p>

            <p>Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.</p>

            <h2>Bayes optimal learning of attention-indexed models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Boncoraglio, Emanuele Troiani, Vittorio Erba, Lenka Zdeborová</p>
            <p>We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in self-attention layers, that are key components of modern architectures.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Ruks, J. Ruostekoski</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</p>

            <h2>Spatially Correlated Noise Induces Transitions from the Diffusive to Ballistic Regime in Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse</p>
            <p>We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated thermal noise characterized by a single length scale. This formulation is constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the fluctuation--dissipation relation (FDR), which enforces the same spatial correlation in the viscous diffusion term and therefore gives rise to nonlocal momentum transport. Numerical simulations of tracer diffusion in fluids governed by this formulation reveal that the mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length $\ell$ and the correlation strength $\beta$. Intuitively, increasing $\ell$ enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, as a larger correlation length slows momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing $\beta$ also increases the MSD, since a weaker correlation strength also retards momentum diffusion, whereas smaller $\ell$ or larger $\beta$ suppresses the ballistic regime and leads to a diffusive behavior. The emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from how spatial correlations, incorporated through the FDR to maintain equilibrium, alter the effective momentum transport across scales. Interestingly, we further show that the resulting nonlocal diffusion is reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sibylle Driezen, Adrien Molines</p>
            <p>We study the proposed integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non-compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the continuum limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce field "hotspots" that can act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that, surprisingly, material dissipation alone cannot fully regularize the singular behavior of the normal modes of a nonreciprocal cavity. We demonstrate that the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</p>

Using reflection positivity, we prove that the ground state lies in the sector of a uniform $\pi$-flux per plaquette and that the monopoles are massive.

By considering adiabatic $\pi$-flux insertion, we construct dressed monopole excitations, show that their self-braiding is proportional to the Hall conductance and hence vanishes, and prove that their braiding with the fermionic excitations is that of the toric code.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domagoj Fijan, Maria R. Ward Rashidi, Sharon C. Glotzer</p>
            <p>Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface.

            <h2>A study of the electronic and ionic structure, for competing states of fully and partially ionized hydrogen, using the neutral pseudo-atom method as well as a classical map for the electron subsystem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. W. C. Dharma-wardana</p>
            <p>Prof. Bonitz and his collaborators have made seminal contributions to the study of the uniform electron fluid and the electron-proton fluid, viz., hydrogen, in using {\it ab initio} simulations, as reflected in this festschrift. Here we review the theoretical methods available for these systems where traditional small-parameter methods fail. We use the neutral-pseudo atom (NPA) method, and a classical map for quantum electrons to study hydrogen plasmas. We show that {\it both} fully-ionized and partially-ionized hydrogen phases can exist with the same nominal density and temperature, at pressures and temperatures of interest to planetary physics. The mean ionization $\bar{Z}$, pair-distribution functions, free energies, pressures and conductivities are calculated for the competing phases. Here $\bar{Z}$ is also a measure of the miscibility of fully ionized and un-ionized hydrogen. Recent studies using path-integral Monte Carlo methods, and $N$-atom Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations have provided essential structure data including the electron-electron structure factor $S_{ee}(k)$ that enters into interpretation of X-ray Thomson scattering and other diagnostics. We show that these structure data can be inexpensively evaluated using classical-map schemes for fully ionized plasmas, and more generally, using one-atom (average-atom) DFT methods for partially ionized systems.</p>

            <p>Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</p>

            <p>Spread complexity uses the distribution of support of a time-evolving state in the Krylov basis to quantify dispersal across accessible dimensions of a Hilbert space. Here, we describe how variations in initial conditions, the Hamiltonian, and the dimension of the Hilbert space affect spread complexity and Krylov basis structure. We introduce Koherence, the entropy of coherence between perturbed and unperturbed Krylov bases, which can, e.g., quantify dynamical amplification of differences in initial conditions in chaos. To illustrate, we show that dynamics on SL(2,R), SU(2), and Heisenberg-Weyl group manifolds, often used as paradigmatic settings for contrasting chaotic and integrable (semi-)classical behavior, display distinctively different responses to variations of the initial state or Hamiltonian. We then describe a lattice model that displays linear growth of spread complexity, saturating for bounded lattices and continuing forever in a thermodynamic limit. The latter example illustrates a breakdown of continuum/classical effective descriptions of complexity growth in bounded quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the ground state of a spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial anisotropies, single-ion anisotropy $D$ and Ising-like anisotropy $J$, within the Haldane phase can serve as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation implementing single-qubit gates. The gate fidelity of both elementary rotation gates and general single-qubit unitary gates composed of rotations about the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes is evaluated, and is found to exceed 0.99 when $D$ or $J$ is appropriately tuned. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the rotation-gate fidelity under the assumption that the state lies within the $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$-protected Haldane phase, showing that it is determined by the post-measurement spin-spin correlation function and the failure probability. The observed enhancement of gate fidelity in the spin-1 XXZ chain originates from the strengthening of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations near the AFM phase, which effectively suppresses failure states.</p>

            <h2>A Global Spacetime Optimization Approach to the Real-Space Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enze Hou, Yuzhi Liu, Lei Wang, Han Wang</p>
            <p>The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>We construct a simple holographic model incorporating higher-order coupling terms for electron self-interactions. It can exhibit typical behavior of a Mott insulator, including a metal-insulator transition and a decrease in DC conductivity with the increase of charge density. In the analysis of AC conductivity, a soft gap is generally observed. Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals. With the increase of DC conductivity, the multi-peak structure gradually reverts to soft-gap behavior or even metallic conductivity. The numerical reliability is confirmed by the agreement between zero-frequency AC and DC conductivities.</p>

            <p>We study the interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in the square-lattice Hubbard model under periodic driving with circularly polarized light. Formulating diagrammatic techniques based on the random-phase approximation in terms of Floquet Green's functions, allows us to analyze fluctuation-driven unconventional pairing for weak-to-moderate interactions. The interplay of repulsive interactions and photo-assisted hopping of electrons gives rise to a rich magnetic phase diagram featuring an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic crossover prior to a Floquet Lifshitz transition. Close to the antiferromagnetic transition, topological $d+id$-wave superconductivity prevails in the phase diagram for a wide range of drive parameters. At intermediate-to-high frequency driving near the Floquet Lifshitz transition, superconducting orders are tuned from spin-singlet $d$-wave to spin-triplet $p$-wave character, providing an effective protocol for Floquet engineering topological superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Due to the Coulomb blockade effect, electrons rarely bunch during transport, a phenomenon observed only in a few specially engineered mesoscopic configurations. In this work, we introduce an atomically resolved shot-noise study to demonstrate the possibility of electron bunching through vibrational coupling which takes place in an atomically sized nano-electro-mechanical system. Using tunnelling spectroscopy, we observe signatures of vibron-assisted tunnelling on an Fe impurity in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Notably, simultaneous shot-noise measurements at the centre of the vibrating impurity reveal super-Poissonian noise. In the absence of alternative sources of super-Poissonian noise, this implies vibronic-coupling-induced bunching of electrons during the tunnelling process through the impurity, as theoretically predicted decades ago. As a future outlook, if coherence between electrons can be implemented, vibron-mediated electron bunching at single atomic sites may be exploited as a local injection source of $N$-paired electrons.</p>

            <p>We investigate the periodic Anderson model composed of an itinerant $c$-band and a strongly localized $f$-band, featuring on-site electron-electron interactions in the $f$-orbitals. The two bands interact via a hybridization term with spin-orbit coupling, which enables spin-flip processes. In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital. Conversely, in the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase, both $c$- and $f$-orbitals sustain robust Dirac cones. We establish that spin-orbit coupling in the hybridization term gives rise to Dirac cones, which, combined with additional symmetry-breaking conditions, can generate novel topological states.</p>

For parameters relevant to the prototypical organic semiconductor rubrene, we compute the frequency-dependent charge mobility and find excellent agreement with results from the state-of-the-art hierarchical equations of motion method. These results show that the method, previously validated only for the single-mode Holstein model, preserves quantitative accuracy in substantially more complex and material-relevant regimes.

Here, we combined tapping mode AFM imaging with a Pt ultramicroelectrode to investigate oxygen bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment. Our AFM feedback error signal and topography data reveal that bubbles of O2 gas nucleate at the step edge sites and interact with the catalytically active sites. This interaction between primary catalytic sites and bubble nucleation sites is the primary reason for a decrease in the current density at a given high overpotential of the OER.

            <p>A mechanism for electrically tunable PT-symmetric magnonic lasing and anti-lasing is proposed along with a device consisting of a current-biased region in a magnetically ordered planar waveguide. Within the bias area, several heavy-metal wires carrying dc charge current are periodically attached to the waveguide and exert so spatially periodic spin-orbit torques, producing current-controllable modulated magnon gain and loss. It is demonstrated that this decorated waveguide can emit a strong, single frequency magnon mode at the Bragg point (lasing) and also absorb at the same frequency phase-matched incoming coherent magnons (anti-lasing). The underlying physics is captured by an analytical model and validated with full material and device-specific numerical simulations. The magnonic laser absorber response is tunable via the current density in the wires, the extent of the biased region, and the intrinsic damping, enabling the control of lasing frequency and emission power. The structure is shown to amplify thermal magnons, offering a route to low-noise on-chip microwave sources. The concept is compatible with planar waveguides, ring geometries, and antiferromagnets. The results establish an experimentally realistic platform where a single element functions simultaneously as both magnon laser and absorber, opening opportunities for reconfigurable non-Hermitian magnonics and integrated magnon signal processing.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Chern Insulators Transition in Non-ideal Flat Bands of Twisted Mono-bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moru Song, Kai Chang</p>
            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal $|C|>1$ flat bands can be viewed as color-entangled composites of $C$ lowest Landau levels, but in realistic moiré systems non-ideal quantum geometry complicates this picture, leaving their stabilization mechanism incompletely understood. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $\kappa$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $\kappa$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a "color separator," explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced coherence in the periodically driven two-dimensional XY model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duilio De Santis, Marios H. Michael, Sambuddha Chattopadhyay, Andrea Cavalleri, Gil Refael, Patrick A. Lee, Eugene A. Demler</p>
            <p>Strong optical drives have been shown to induce transient superconducting-like response in materials above their equilibrium $T_c$. Many of these materials already exhibit short-range superconducting correlations in equilibrium. This motivates the question: can external driving enhance coherence in systems with superconducting correlations but no long-range order? We explore this scenario in the two-dimensional XY model with a periodically modulated stiffness using overdamped Langevin dynamics. We find that, even though the modulation leaves the average coupling unchanged, the drive can markedly increase long-range, time-averaged correlations in systems well above the equilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature. The outcome depends on the ratio of the drive frequency to the intrinsic relaxation rate: faster drives primarily heat the system, suppressing correlations and conductivity. For slower drives, the optical conductivity is modified so that the real part exhibits a prolonged effective Drude scattering time, while the imaginary part has a strengthened low-frequency $1/\omega$ behavior. We map out these regimes across temperature, frequency, and amplitude, and rationalize them via simple analytics and vortex-thermalization arguments. Overall, we identify a generic nonequilibrium route to enhance coherence in XY-like systems, with potential relevance to experiments reporting light-induced superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Direct vs. Indirect Measurement of the Effective Electronic Temperature in Quantum Dot Solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Kompatscher, Morteza Shokrani, Johanna Feurstein, Martijn Kemerink</p>
            <p>One of the characteristics of disordered semiconductors is the slow thermalization of charge carriers after excitation due to photoabsorption or high electric fields. An elegant way to capture the effects of the latter on the conductivity is through a field-dependent effective electronic temperature T_eff that can significantly exceed that of the lattice. Despite its elegance, its actual use has been limited, which, at least in part, can be attributed to the concept originating from computer simulations; experimental confirmations have largely been indirect (through scaling of conductivity) and did not establish that T_eff equals the real temperature of the electron distribution. Moreover, it has hardly been tested for important classes of disordered materials, including quantum dot solids. Here, we investigate whether the effective temperature concept is applicable to quantum dot solids, using zinc oxide as relevant model system. To verify that field-driven conductivity increases indeed reflect an actual increase of the electronic temperature, we combine direct and indirect measurements of T_eff: we convert conductivity changes at high fields to an effective temperature that we show to be consistent with a direct measurement of the electronic temperature using the Seebeck effect. These results not only confirm the relevance of the effective temperature concept to quantum dot solids but also confirm its general physical reality and open the way to systematic investigations into charge carrier (de)localization in disordered media.</p>

            <h2>Electric field-dependent conductivity as probe for charge carrier delocalization and morphology in organic semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Morteza Shokrani, Felix Maximilian Graf, Anton Kompatscher, Dennis Derewjanko, Martijn Kemerink</p>
            <p>The charge carrier localization length {\alpha} is a crucial, yet often ignored parameter of conjugated polymers that exponentially influences electronic conductivity. Here, we argue it is a unique proxy of the energy landscape as determined by sample morphology and experienced by mobile charges. To determine {\alpha}, we use that in disordered organic semiconductors, slow thermalization of charge carriers after excitation, e.g. by hopping in a finite electric field, can lead to an effective electronic temperature (T_eff) exceeding the lattice temperature, thereby enhancing conductivity. We experimentally probe this effect by combining temperature- and field-dependent conductivity measurements for a range of representative conjugated polymers, using different dopants, doping protocols and doping concentrations. We find that in the high-field regime (F>1E6V/m), T_eff exhibits distinct trends vs. structural order and doping level, which can be used to extract (effective) localization lengths ranging from ~1nm in fully amorphous systems to over ~10nm in highly ordered polymers. Tight-binding and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are used to connect measured values to morphological properties and to rule out alternative explanations. Our results demonstrate that finite-field conductivity measurements provide a powerful probe of a characteristic length scale of charge transport that is complementary to conventional structural characterization.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic Switching of Perpendicular Ferromagnets by Higher-order Spin-orbit Torque in Noncentrosymmetric Weyl Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naomi Fokkens, Fei Xue</p>
            <p>Field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular ferromagnets is a central challenge for spintronics applications, typically requiring explicit symmetry breaking. Here we show that deterministic switching can instead be achieved through higher-order (in magnetization angles) spin-orbit torques, even in systems that preserve in-plane mirror symmetry. Using a vector spherical harmonics expansion, we demonstrate that higher-order torque terms naturally give rise to additional out-of-equator fixed points, enabling reliable magnetization reversal when their magnitude is comparable to conventional lowest-order torques. We illustrate this mechanism with first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric Weyl ferromagnet PrAlGe, where the combination of Weyl-node band topology and strong spin-orbit coupling produces sizable higher-order torque components. Because the Fermi surface is small, the conventional lowest-order torques are relatively weak, allowing the higher-order harmonics to compete on equal footing and strongly reshape the magnetization dynamics. The resulting spin dynamics confirm deterministic switching without additional symmetry breaking. Our results establish higher-order spin-orbit torque as a key ingredient for understanding and controlling magnetization dynamics in topological and spintronic materials.</p>

            <h2>From Laplacian-to-Adjacency Matrix for Continuous Spins on Graphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikita Titov, Andrea Trombettoni</p>
            <p>The study of spins and particles on graphs has many applications across different fields, from time dynamics on networks to the solution of combinatorial problems. Here, we study the large n limit of the $O(n)$ model on general graphs, which is considerably more difficult than on regular lattices. Indeed, the loss of translational invariance gives rise to an infinite set of saddle point constraints in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the free energy at low and high temperature $T$ is determined by the spectrum of two crucial objects from graph theory: the Laplacian matrix at low $T$ and the Adjacency matrix at high $T$. Their interplay is studied in several classes of graphs. For regular lattices the two coincide. We obtain an exact solution on trees, where the Lagrange multipliers interestingly depend solely on the number of nearest neighbors. For decorated lattices, the singular part of the free energy is governed by the Laplacian spectrum, whereas this is true for the full free energy only in the zero temperature limit. Finally, we discuss a bipartite fully connected graph to highlight the importance of a finite coordination number in these results. Results for quantum spin models on a loopless graph are also presented.</p>

            <h2>Stoichiometry and Phase Control in K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ via Self-Flux Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Eder, Catherine Witteveen, Enrico Giannini, Fabian O. von Rohr</p>
            <p>Layered delafossite-type magnetic materials, such as KCrSe$_2$, are promising platforms for studying magnetic systems and potential frustration on triangular lattices. Synthesis, structure-type control, and off-stoichiometries remain major challenges in the investigation of these delafossite-type magnets. Starting from the same self-flux composition (K:Cr:Se = 8:1:8), we isolated three distinct K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ phases with $x$ = 0, 0.13--0.17, and 0.32--0.35, each adopting a different structure type depending on the quenching temperature applied. The phase evolution indicates a sequence of transformations during synthesis between compounds with varying degrees of potassium deficiency. Building on these insights into phase stability and crystal growth, we successfully grew single crystals of full-stoichiometric KCrSe$_2$ -- enabling direction-dependent magnetization measurements. These measurements reveal a pronounced field dependence of the Néel temperature at low external fields, as well as a weak metamagnetic transition. Our findings demonstrate that even a simple parameter -- such as quenching temperature -- can be used to control stoichiometry, direct phase formation, and ultimately tune the magnetic properties of delafossite-type materials.</p>

            <p>We report broadband dielectric spectra of the non-Kramers hexaaluminate PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}), revealing a pronounced interplay between permittivity and magnetization at cryogenic temperatures. The zero-field dielectric response follows a Barrett-type quantum-paraelectric form, while a broad dielectric anomaly near 5 K shifts systematically to higher temperatures under applied magnetic fields, evidencing robust magnetoelectric coupling. The inverse permittivity (\varepsilon'^{-1}(T,H)) scales linearly with (M^{2}), consistent with a biquadratic (P^{2}M^{2}) term in a Landau framework. Fits yield temperature-dependent coupling constants (\lambda(T)) that decrease with heating, reflecting the thermal population of low-lying energy levels of Pr(^{3+}). These results identify PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}) as a paradigmatic non-Kramers hexaaluminate where quantum paraelectricity and magnetoelectric interactions are intrinsically entangled, establishing hexaaluminates as a tunable platform for magnetoelectric physics in frustrated quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Hierarchical materials in the natural world are often made through the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules. Achieving similar structural complexity in synthetic materials requires understanding how various molecular parameters affect assembly behavior. In recent years, inverse surfactants -- molecules with hydrophobic head groups and hydrophilic macromolecular tails -- have been shown to self-assemble into supramolecular assemblies in aqueous solutions that show promise for a number of applications, including drug delivery. Here, we build an understanding of the morphological phase diagram of inverse surfactants using insights from scattering experiments, computer simulations, and statistical mechanics. The scattering and simulation results reveal that changing the head-group size is an important molecular knob in controlling morphological transitions. The molecular size ratio of the hydrophobic group to the hydrophilic emerges as a crucial dimensionless quantity in our theory and plays a determining role in setting the micelle structure and the transition from mesoscale to macroscale aggregates. Our minimal theory is able to qualitatively explain the key features of the morphological phase diagram, including the prevalence of fiber-like structures in comparison to spherical and planar micelles. Together, these findings provide a more complete picture for the molecular dependencies of assemblies of inverse surfactants, which we hope may aid in the de novo design of supramolecular structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fengyu Xie, Ruoyu Wang, Taoyuze Lv, Yuxiang Gao, Hongyu Wu, Zhicheng Zhong</p>
            <p>The emergence of deep learning has brought the long-standing goal of comprehensively understanding and exploring crystalline materials closer to reality. Yet, universal exploration across all elements remains hindered by the combinatorial explosion of possible chemical environments, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. Crucially, within any finite set of elements, the diversity of short-range bonding types and local geometric motifs is inherently limited. Guided by this chemical intuition, we propose a chemical-system-centric strategy for crystalline materials exploration. In this framework, generative models are coupled with machine-learned force fields as fast energy evaluators, and both are iteratively refined in a closed-loop cycle of generation, evaluation, and fine-tuning. Using the Li-P-S ternary system as a case study, we show that this approach captures the diversity of local environments with minimal additional first-principles data while maintaining structural creativity, achieving closed-loop convergence toward chemical completeness within a bounded chemical space. We further demonstrate downstream applications, including phase-diagram construction, ionic-diffusivity screening, and electronic-structure prediction. Together, this strategy provides a systematic and data-efficient framework for modeling both atomistic and electronic structures within defined chemical spaces, bridging accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way toward scalable, AI-driven discovery of crystalline materials with human-level creativity and first-principles fidelity.</p>

We experimentally realize interlayer sliding by bending the bilayer graphene geometry across a nanoridge. Systematic electronic transport measurements reveal topological valley transport when the Fermi energy resides within the band gap, consistent with theoretical predictions of eight topological channels. Our findings establish interlayer sliding as a powerful tool for tuning the electronic properties of bilayer graphene and underscore its potential for broad application across 2D material systems.</p>

            <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit exceptional properties arising from a combination of thermodynamic, kinetic and structural factors and have found applications in numerous fields such as aerospace, energy, chemical industries, hydrogen storage, and ocean engineering. However, a large compositional space remains to be explored. Unlike conventional approaches, computational methods have shown accelerated discovery of novel alloys in a short time. However, the lack of interatomic potentials have posed a challenge in discovering new alloy compositions and property measurements. In the present work, we have developed a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) trained by Machine Learning based approach using the BFGS unconstrained optimization algorithm for the CoCrFeMnNi High-entropy alloy. Our training set consists of various defects induced configurations such as vacancies, dislocations and stacking-faults. An active learning scheme to re-train the potential was undertaken to dynamically to add training data upon encountering extrapolative configurations during non-equilibrium simulations. A thorough investigation of the error metrics, equation of state, uniaxial tensile deformation, nano-indentation and solid-liquid interface stability for this alloy was carried out, and it is seen that the MTP potential outperforms the popular Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential on physical properties prediction. The accuracy and high computational speed are discussed using scaling performance. The potential is prepared for public use by embedding it into the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) code.</p>

            <p>Small clusters of $^4$He atoms provide a paradigmatic setting for exploring universal phenomena in few-body quantum systems with large scattering length. Their weakly bound states serve as ideal test cases for studying Efimov physics and the emergence of universality beyond the three-body sector. In this work, we investigate few-$^4$He systems within a finite-cutoff effective field theory (EFT) framework. The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schrödinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems. Our findings establish a quantitative bridge between realistic helium potentials and finite-cutoff EFT, showing that the latter provides an efficient and predictive framework for describing few-body universality in weakly bound quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Full counting statistics for boundary driven transport in presence of correlated gain and loss channels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katha Ganguly, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla</p>
            <p>One of the major advances of quantum technology is the engineering of complex quantum channels in lattice systems that paves the way for a variety of novel non-equilibrium phenomena. For a boundary driven lattice with such engineered quantum channels, the analysis of the full counting statistics of current across boundaries has received limited attention. In this work, we consider a boundary driven free fermionic lattice with carefully engineered correlated gain and loss channels and obtain the cumulant generating function of the steady-state particle current. We also discuss the limit for simplifying the correlated gain-loss channel to a local gain-loss channel and obtain the average current and its fluctuation in such cases. Generally, in the presence of gain-loss, the current statistics are different at the two ends of the lattice. Hence, for both local and correlated gain-loss, we devise the conditions for which the statistics can coincide, giving rise to a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric balanced gain-loss scenario. A striking difference between the correlated gain-loss and their local counterpart is the emergence of nonreciprocity in the system and we observe that it has a dramatic impact in the current as well as fluctuations. Our work therefore provides interesting insights about the importance of engineered dissipators in boundary driven systems.</p>

            <p>We present a data-driven analysis of correlation hierarchies in the quarter-filled simple and extended Hubbard models by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to exact-diagonalization (ED) data on 3x4 and 4x4 cylindrical clusters. While the non-interacting limit (U=0) provides a finite-size reference, increasing on-site repulsion U induces localization and reorganizes the low-energy spectrum. For the extended model, we examine moderate (U=4) and strong (U=10) coupling regimes, where conventional structure factors reveal familiar crossovers among charge, spin and local-pairing correlations. PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components. This establishes PCA as a transparent, model-agnostic framework for uncovering the hierarchy and competition of correlation channels in finite Hubbard lattice clusters, providing a bridge between exact diagonalization and modern machine-learning diagnostics in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.</p>

            <p>The presence of interfaces in semiconductor devices substantially hinders thermal transport, contributing disproportionately to the overall thermal resistance. However, approaches to enhance interfacial thermal transport remain scarce without changing the interface structure, as the intrinsic electron and phonon properties of constituent materials set an upper limit. Here, we find a new thermal transport pathway, electronic heat tunneling, to enhance interfacial thermal conductance through metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions. By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux. Our Letter demonstrates a previously unexplored heat transport mechanism to enhance thermal conductance, bypassing the need for interface engineering. These findings emphasize the essential need to understand semiconductor thermal properties under realistic operating conditions.</p>

            <p>Dense bacterial suspensions at fluid interfaces provide a natural platform to explore active turbulence in a dimensional mismatch: active units are restricted to a two-dimensional surface, while the induced flows extend into the surrounding three-dimensional liquid. Using hydrophobic Serratia marcescens at the air-water interface, we realize interfacial bacterial turbulence as a distinct class of active turbulence. The system exhibits compressible in-plane flows, with vortex size initially increasing with the thickness of the underlying fluid and saturating near 100 $\mu$ m, independent of bacterial length. This behavior contrasts sharply with bulk active turbulence, where correlation length typically scales with system size. Hydrodynamic theory, together with direct measurements of the three-dimensional flow field, shows that the coupling between interfacial and bulk flows sets the emergent length scale. Our results uncover the fundamental physics of interfacial bacterial turbulence and open new strategies for geometric control of collective active flows.</p>

While traditionally explored in equilibrium contexts, growing evidence underscores the transformative role of active components, such as motor proteins, enzymatic catalysts, and synthetic microswimmers, in modulating the dynamics of phase-separated systems. Here, we encapsulate motile bacteria within phase-separated aqueous droplets to examine how internal activity shapes interfacial behavior. By tuning bacterial density, we control the magnitude of active stresses at the droplet interface. At low activity, we observe scale-dependent interfacial fluctuations featuring propagative wave this http URL, despite the low Reynolds number regime, these waves arise from an effective inertial response that emerges when bacterial active stresses balance viscous dissipation. At high activity, droplets exhibit pronounced deformation that exceeds the Rayleigh-Plateau instability threshold, accompanied by enhanced motility that accelerates coarsening. Our findings demonstrate how active stresses can reshape morphology and dynamics in multiphase systems, offering new insights into the physics of internally driven phase-separated fluids.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum inverse problems in one-dimensional (1D) electronic disordered systems strongly coupled to optical cavities. More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-André-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional moiré superlattices have been extensively studied, and a variety of correlated phenomena have been observed. However, their lower-dimensional counterpart, one-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices, remain largely unexplored. Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moiré superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moiré superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures. Strikingly, the T-linear conductance leads to a strongly suppressed Luttinger parameter, suggesting a state of extreme correlation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhihua Zheng, Xiaolong Yao, Cailian Yu, Menghao Gao, Fangping Ouyang, Shiwu Gao</p>
            <p>The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.</p>

            <h2>The role of interaction in matter wave optics with motional states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> RuGway Wu, Maximilian Prüfer, Jörg Schmiedmayer</p>
            <p>Matter-wave optics is often viewed as a linear analogue of photonics, where noninteracting particles are coherently split, diffracted, and recombined, and interference arises from single-particle coherence. In ultracold quantum gases, however, interactions are intrinsic and can rival or exceed kinetic and optical energy scales. This drives matter-wave optics into a nonlinear regime: diffraction and momentum distributions become interaction-dependent, interference contrast degrades or collapses, and revival dynamics appear. In the mean time, interactions can generate squeezing and entanglement, enabling sensitivities beyond the standard quantum limit. We showcase representative examples - covering diffraction, splitting, and interferometry - that illustrate how interactions reshape the basic elements of matter-wave optics and open new opportunities for nonlinear quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling the Surface Stability and Chemical Reactivity of Aza-Triphenylene Monolayer under O$_2$ and H$_2$O Exposure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumendra Kumar Das, Prasanjit Samal, Brahmananda Chakraborty, Sridhar Sahu</p>
            <p>Environmental oxidation has a great impact in tuning the physical, chemical and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) monolayers which can affect their practical applications in nanoscale engineering devices under ambient conditions. aza-triphenylene is a recently synthesized 2D materials whose practcal applications have not been systematically studied yet. In this study, we report for the first time, the adsorption and dissociation of O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules on the surface of 2D aza-triphenylene monolayer through first principles calculations in combination with climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method. The results indicates that both the O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules weakly interact over the monolayer surface with an adsorption energy -0.16 eV and -0.37 eV respectively. In contrast, both the molecules exhibit resistance for dissociation due to the formation of energy barriers. The transition path indicates that molecular oxygen experience two energy barriers (0.16 ev and 1.22 eV) before getting dissociated atomic oxygen. However, the dissociation of H$_2$O requires larger energy barrier (2.3 eV and 0.86 eV) due to breaking of covalent bonds and transfer of hydrogen. The strong chemical adsorption of atomic oxygen and H$^+$/OH$^-$ ions is due to the significant charge transfer from monolayer to the adsorbate as evidenced from the charge density difference and Bader charge analysis. Moreover, the dissociated configuration exhibit a larger band gap as compared to the pristine aza-triphenylene due to the strong hybridization between the p states of carbon and oxygen. our work predicts the robustness of azatriphylene monolayer against oxygen/water exposer thus ensuring their stability for device applications using these materials.</p>

            <h2>Dissimilarity measures for generalized Lotka-Volterra systems on networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolás A. Márquez, Maryam Chaib De Mares, Alejandro P. Riascos</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce a general framework to quantify dissimilarities between generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamical processes, ranging from classical predator-prey systems to multispecies communities interacting on networks. The proposed measures capture both transient and stationary dynamics, allowing systematic comparisons across systems with varying interaction parameters, network weights, or topologies. Our analysis shows that even subtle structural changes can lead to markedly distinct outcomes: in two-species systems, interaction strength and initial conditions strongly affect divergence, while in small directed networks, differences that are invisible at the adjacency-matrix level produce divergent dynamics. In modular networks, the fraction and distribution of negative interactions control the transition from stable to unstable dynamics, with localized perturbations within cliques yielding different global outcomes than distributed ones. Beyond structural variations, the framework also applies when modified processes follow distinct nonlinear equations, demonstrating its versatility. Taken together, these results highlight that dynamical dissimilarity measures provide a powerful tool to analyze robustness, detect structural sensitivity, and predict instabilities in nonlinear systems. More broadly, this approach supports the comparative analysis of biological systems, where complex interaction networks and nonlinear dynamics are central to stability and resilience.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Houzet, T. Vakhtel, J. S. Meyer</p>
            <p>In a SQUID tuned away from half-integer flux (in units of the superconducting flux quantum), the concurrence of multiple Josephson harmonics and an asymmetry between the junctions leads to the Josephson diode effect -- a nonreciprocal current-voltage characteristic manifested as an asymmetry of critical currents at opposite polarities. We predict a dual version of this effect in a gate-tunable Cooper pair transistor placed in series with a highly resistive environment. When tuned away from half-integer gate charge (in units of the Cooper pair charge) it shows an asymmetry of critical voltages at opposite polarities -- a dual diode effect we refer to as the Bloch diode effect. It arises from an asymmetry in the dispersion of the transistor's Bloch bands. A highly resistive environment can be realized with a Josephson junction array, suggesting that such a diode could be implemented using conventional superconducting quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Three important driving forces for creating qualitatively new phases in quantum materials are the topology of the materials' electronic band structures, frustration in the electrons' motion or magnetic interactions, and strong correlations between their charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.</p>

            <h2>Giant number-parity effect and scalable spin squeezing in Luttinger liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Caleca, Saverio Bocini, Fabio Mezzacapo, Tommaso Roscilde</p>
            <p>Finite-size quantum spin systems can be magnetized by the application of a symmetry-breaking field, but in general their symmetry is expected to be restored once the field is turned off adiabatically. Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $\xi_R^2 \sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Léopold Van Brandt, Grégoire Brandsteert, Denis Flandre</p>
            <p>The excitability property of spiking neurons describes their capability to output an action potential as a real-time response to an input synaptic excitation current and is central to the event-based neuromorphic computing paradigm. The spiking mechanism is analysed in a representative ultra-low-power analog neuron from the circuit literature. Relying on conventional SPICE simulations compatible with industrial transistor compact models, we establish a excitation criterion, quantified either in terms of critical supplied charge or membrane potential threshold. Only the latter is found intrinsic to the neuron, i.e. independent of the input stimulus. Rigorous analysis of the nonlinear neuron dynamics provides insight but still needs to be explored further, as well as the effect of the intrinsic noise.</p>

            <h2>Lattice Thermal Transport Beyond the Quasiparticle Approximation: Nontrivial Spectral Competition between Three- and Four-Phonon Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Xia</p>
            <p>The breakdown of the quasiparticle approximation (QPA) for phonons in strongly anharmonic materials necessitates advanced first-principles frameworks for accurate lattice dynamics and thermal transport predictions. We develop a comprehensive beyond-quasiparticle approximation (BQPA) approach incorporating both three- (3ph) and four-phonon (4ph) interactions and apply it to investigate lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) in MgO, PbTe, and AgCl -- materials that span a broad spectrum of anharmonicity, from weak to severe anharmonic regimes with overdamped phonons. We reveal that while BQPA consistently increases $\kappa_{\rm L}$ relative to QPA due to phonon softening when considering only 3ph interactions, the inclusion of additional 4ph interactions hardens the phonon spectrum and suppresses this enhancement, bringing BQPA and QPA predictions into close agreement via subtle spectral competition effects across all three compounds. These findings highlight that accurate modeling of $\kappa_{\rm L}$ in strongly anharmonic materials requires treating both full phonon spectral function and higher-order anharmonicity on equal footing. Our work establishes a systematic framework for modeling thermal transport in systems with overdamped phonons and provides critical insights for materials design beyond the limits of conventional phonon transport theory.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic integration, fermion sign problem, and real-space renormalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koka Sathwik, Werner Krauth</p>
            <p>We reconsider real-space renormalization for the two-dimensional Ising model, following the path traced out by Wilson in Sect. VI of his 1975 Reviews of Modern Physics. In that reference, Wilson considerably extended the Kadanoff decimation procedure towards a possibly rigorous construction of a real-space scale-invariant hamiltonian. Wilson's construction has, to the best of our knowledge, never been fully understood and thus neither reproduced nor generalized. In the present work, we use Monte Carlo sampling in combination with thermodynamic integration in order to retrace Wilson's computation for a real-space renormalization with a number of terms in the hamiltonian. We elaborate on the connection of real-space renormalization with the fermion sign problem and discuss to which extent our Monte Carlo procedure actually implements Wilson's program from half a century ago.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjay Bhandarkar, Debarshi Mitra, Jürgen Horbach, Apratim Chatterji</p>
            <p>Under high cylindrical confinement, segments of ring polymers can be localized along the long axis of the cylinder by introducing internal loops within the ring polymer. The emergent organization of the polymer segments occurs because of the entropic repulsion between internal loops. These principles were used to identify the underlying mechanism of bacterial chromosome organization. Here, we outline functional principles associated with entropic interactions, leading to specific orientations of the ring polymers relative to their neighbors in the cylindrical confinement. We achieve this by modifying the ring polymer topology by creating internal loops of two different sizes within the polymer, and thus create an asymmetry. This allows us to strategically manipulate polymer topology such that segments of a polymer face certain other segments of a neighboring polymer. The polymers therefore behave as if they are subjected to an `effective' entropic interaction reminiscent of interactions between Ising spins. But this emergent spatial and orientational organization is not enthalpy-driven. We consider a bead spring model of flexible polymers with only repulsive excluded volume interactions between the monomers. The polymers entropically repel each other and occupy different halves of the cylinder, and moreover, the adjacent polymers preferentially re-orient themselves along the axis of the cylinder. We further substantiate our observations by free energy calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the emergence of effective orientational interactions by harnessing entropic interactions in flexible polymers. The principles elucidated here could be relevant to understand the interactions between different sized loops within a large chromosome.</p>

            <p>In a finite-time continuous phase transition, topological defects emerge as the system undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts how the defect density scales with the quench rate. During such processes, dissipation also arises as the system fails to adiabatically follow the control protocol near the critical point. Quantifying and minimizing this dissipation is fundamentally relevant to nonequilibrium thermodynamics and practically important for energy-efficient computing and devices. However, there are no prior experimental measurements of dissipation, or the optimization of control protocols to reduce it in many-body systems. In addition, it is an open question to what extent dissipation is correlated with the formation of defects. Here, we directly measure the dissipation generated during the voltage-driven Freedericksz transition of a liquid crystal with a sensitivity equivalent to a ~10 nanokelvin temperature rise. We observe Kibble-Zurek scaling of dissipation and its breakdown, both in quantitative agreement with existing theoretical works. We further implement a fully automated in-situ optimization approach that discovers more optimal driving protocols, reducing dissipation by a factor of three relative to a simple linear protocol.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Mechanics of Arterial Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Kumar, Arash Yavari</p>
            <p>In this paper, we formulate a geometric theory of the mechanics of arterial growth. An artery is modeled as a finite-length thick shell that is made of an incompressible nonlinear anisotropic solid. An initial radially-symmetric distribution of finite radial and circumferential eigenstrains is assumed. Bulk growth is assumed to be isotropic. A novel framework is proposed to describe the time evolution of growth, governed by a competition between the elastic energy and a \emph{growth energy}. The governing equations are derived through a two-potential approach and using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. An isotropic dissipation potential is considered, which is assumed to be convex in the rate of growth function. Several numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting the evolution of arterial growth and the intricate interplay among eigenstrains, residual stresses, elastic energy, growth energy, and dissipation potential. A distinctive feature of the model is that the growth variable is not constrained by an explicit upper bound; instead, growth naturally approaches a steady-state value as a consequence of the intrinsic energetic competition.</p>

            <p>Periodically driven many-body systems generally heat towards a featureless 'infinite-temperature' state. As an alternative to uniform heating in a clean system, here we establish a Floquet superheating regime, where fast heating nucleates at ''hot spots" generated by rare fluctuations in the local energy with respect to an appropriate effective Hamiltonian. Striking macroscopic consequences include exceptionally long-lived prethermalization and non-ergodic bimodal distributions of macroscopic observables. Superheating is predicated on a heating rate depending strongly on the local fluctuation; in our example, this is supplied by a sharp state-selective spin-echo, where the energy absorption is strongly suppressed for low-energy states, while thermal fluctuations open up excessive heating channels. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to show the existence of a critical droplet size, which incorporates heating by the driving field as well as the heat current out of the droplet. Our results shine light on a new heating mechanism and suggest new routes towards stabilizing non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity at oxide interfaces has intrigued researchers for decades, yet the underlying pairing mechanism remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric quantum critical point dramatically enhances interfacial superconductivity in KTaO3. By precisely tuning KTaO3 to its quantum critical composition through 0.8% niobium doping, we achieve a near-doubling of the superconducting transition temperature, reaching 2.9 K. Remarkably, a dome-shaped carrier density dependence emerges exclusively at the quantum critical point, contrasting sharply with the linear scaling observed in undoped interfaces. Our findings establish ferroelectric quantum criticality as a powerful mechanism for enhancing superconductivity and provide compelling evidence for soft-phonon-mediated pairing in these systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hidetsugu Sakaguchi, Boris A. Malomed</p>
            <p>It is known that the usual form of the Ehrenfest theorem (ET), which couples the motion of the center of mass (COM) of the one-dimensional (1D) wave function to the respective classical equation of motion, is not valid in the case of the potential box, confined by the zero boundary conditions. A modified form of the ET was proposed for this case, which includes an effective force originating from the interaction of the 1D quantum particle with the box edges. In this work, we derive an amended ET for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which includes the cubic nonlinear term, as well as for the 2D square-shaped potential box. In the latter case, we derive an amended COM equation of motion with an effective force exerted by the edges of the rectangular box, while the nonlinear term makes no direct contribution to the 1D and 2D versions of the ET. Nonetheless, the nonlinearity affects the amended ET through the edge-generated force. As a result, the nonlinearity of the underlying GPE can make the COM motion in the potential box irregular. The validity of the amended ET for the 1D and 2D GPEs with the respective potential boxes is confirmed by the comparison of numerical simulations of the underlying GPE and the corresponding amended COM equation of motion. The reported findings are relevant to the ongoing experiments carried out for atomic Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in the box potentials.</p>

            <p>ZBLAN glass is highly sensitive to thermal and mechanical stimuli, yet the associated surface chemical changes remain poorly understood. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on multiple ZBLAN samples representing distinct structural states: fully amorphous, incipiently crystalline, and highly crystalline, produced through thermal treatments at 250C and 350C and vibration-assisted processing at 400C under low (L2) and high (H5) vibration levels. High-resolution F 1s, Zr 3d, Hf 4f, Ba 3d, La 3d, and Na 1s spectra show progressive peak sharpening and intensity enhancement with increasing temperature and vibration, indicating reduced surface disorder and greater local structural ordering. The most pronounced changes occur under high vibration at 400C. No binding-energy shifts were detected, confirming that all elements retain their expected oxidation states and that the observed evolution reflects structural rather than chemical changes. These results provide direct evidence that thermomechanical input enhances surface ordering in ZBLAN and clarify its role in crystallization behavior relevant to infrared optical applications.</p>

            <p>Lead (Pb) is a typical low-melting-point ductile metal and serves as an important model material in the study of dynamic responses. Under shock-wave loading, its dynamic mechanical behavior comprises two key phenomena: plastic deformation and shock induced phase transitions. The underlying mechanisms of these processes are still poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms remains challenging for experimental approaches. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are an alternative theoretical tool for studying dynamic responses, as they capture atomic-scale mechanisms such as defect evolution and deformation pathways. However, due to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials, the reliability of previous NEMD studies is questioned. Using our newly developed machine learning potential for Pb-Sn alloys, we revisited the microstructure evolution in response to shock loading under various shock orientations. The results reveal that shock loading along the [001] orientation of Pb exhibits a fast, reversible, and massive phase transition and stacking fault evolution. The behavior of Pb differs from previous studies by the absence of twinning during plastic deformation. Loading along the [011] orientation leads to slow, irreversible plastic deformation, and a localized FCC-BCC phase transition in the Pitsch orientation relationship. This study provides crucial theoretical insights into the dynamic mechanical response of Pb, offering a theoretical input for understanding the microstructure-performance relationship under extreme conditions.</p>

            <p>Zigzag edges of graphene have long been predicted to exhibit magnetic electronic state near the Fermi level, which can cause spin-related phenomena and offer unique potentials for graphene-based spintronics. However, the magnetic conduction channels along these edges have yet been reported experimentally. Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-Pérot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 {\Omega}, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The discovery of topological phases has ushered in a new era of condensed matter physics and revealed a variety of natural and artificial materials. They obey the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), which guarantees the emergence of boundary states with non-zero topological invariants in the bulk. A wide attention has been paid to extending topological phases to nonlinear and non-Hermitian systems. However, the BBC and topological invariants of non-Hermitian nonlinear systems remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish a complete BBC and topological characterization of the topological phases in a class of non-Hermitian nonlinear-eigenvalue systems by introducing an auxiliary system. We restore the BBC broken by non-Hermiticity via employing the generalized Brillouin zone on the auxiliary system. Remarkably, we discover that the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity creates an exotic complex-band topological phase that coexists with the real-band topological phase. Our results enrich the family of nonlinear topological phases and lay a foundation for exploring novel topological physics in metamaterial systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Shirato, Ryota Yambe, Satoru Hayami</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the effects of time-dependent electromagnetic fields on frustrated magnets with the spatial inversion symmetry. Two types of external-field setups are considered: One is a circularly polarized electromagnetic field and the other is a combination of a circularly polarized electric field and a static magnetic field. The system is modeled by a classical frustrated Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, whose ground state is a single-$Q$ spiral spin configuration. The effects of irradiated electric and magnetic fields are taken into account by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the Zeeman coupling, respectively, without heating effects. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that the two field configurations lead to distinct skyrmion crystal (SkX) phases and their associated topological phase transitions: in the former setup, SkXs composed of skyrmions with skyrmion numbers of one and two with opposite signs emerge, whereas in the latter setup, SkXs with the same sign appear. The stabilization mechanisms of these SkXs are accounted for by the competition among electromagnetic-field-induced chiral DM interactions, electric-field-induced three-spin interactions, and the Zeeman coupling based on the high-frequency expansion within the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, for the latter setup, we find that the stability region of the SkX phase varies significantly depending on the timing of the application of the circularly polarized electric field and the static magnetic field. Our findings would broaden the possible routes to generate and control SkXs by time-dependent electromagnetic fields, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and experimental control of topological spin crystals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arijit Chakrabarty, Aman Tripathi, Vimod Kumar, Anurag Tripathi, Arpit Agarwal, Vishwaraj Singh, Saprativ Basu, Samik Nag</p>
            <p>In this study, we attempt to characterize the shape of three different types of grains commonly used in the iron and steel-making industry, namely pellet, sinter and iron ore lump. We choose particles over the entire size ranges used in industrial-scale blast furnace and consider two different size ranges of pellet particles and four different size ranges for sinter and iron ore lumps. We perform image analysis to calculate size and shape-related properties of the grains. We select some of the common length scales used to measure the size of the particles and categorize them in different classes. We show that the length scales of a particular category class are well correlated with each other. We identify the independent, uncorrelated length scales for the particles from different categories. Using these uncorrelated length scales, we define different shape descriptors and obtain the distribution of these shape descriptors for each component of the blast furnace feed. Our image analysis results show that the cumulative distribution curves for these shape descriptors turn out to be nearly independent of the size range for a given type of material. Our study identifies the three key shape descriptors that are required to characterize the shape of the blast furnace feed. Two of these shape descriptors, namely the aspect ratio and the circularity, have been considered important by the researchers earlier as well. The third shape descriptor, the average contact eccentricity to the projected particle diameter ratio, usually not considered to be an important shape descriptor in previous studies, is of high relevance for Discrete Element Method simulations of granular materials.</p>

            <h2>Stochasticity-induced non-Hermitian skin criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Cheng, Hui Jiang, Jun Chen, Lei Zhang, Yee Sin Ang, Ching Hua Lee</p>
            <p>Typically, scaling up the size of a system does not change the shape of its energy spectrum, other than making it denser. Exceptions, however, occur in the new phenomenon of non-Hermitian skin criticality, where closely competing generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) solutions for non-Hermitian state accumulation give rise to anomalously scaling complex spectra. In this work, we discover that such non-Hermitian criticality can generically emerge from stochasticity in the lattice bond orientation, a surprising phenomenon only possible in 2D or beyond. Marked by system size-dependent amplification rate, it can be physically traced to the proliferation of feedback loops arising from excess local non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) accumulation induced by structural disorder. While weak disorder weakens the amplification as intuitively anticipated, stronger disorder enigmatically strengthens the amplification almost universally, scaling distinctly from conventional critical system. By representing cascades of local excess NHSE as ensembles of effectively coupled chains, we analytically derived a critical GBZ that predicts how state amplification scales with the system size and disorder strength, highly consistent with empirical observations. Our new mechanism for disordered-facilitated amplification applies generically to structurally perturbed non-Hermitian lattices with broken reciprocity, and would likely find applications in non-Hermitian sensing through various experimentally mature meta-material platforms.</p>

            <p>We investigate exciton confinement to a quantum wire in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$ where the confinement is achieved by a p-i-n junction. We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states.</p>

            <h2>Accelerated Prediction of Temperature-Dependent Lattice Thermal Conductivity via Ensembled Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Piyush Paliwal, Aftab Alam</p>
            <p>Lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $\kappa_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $\kappa_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data \textcolor{black}{obtained} from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $\kappa_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $\kappa_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $\kappa_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $\kappa_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler \textcolor{black}{compounds} and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $\kappa_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $\kappa_L$ for thermoelectric applications.</p>

            <h2>Variationally Consistent Framework for Finite-Strain Microelasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tushar Jogi</p>
            <p>Modeling microstructural evolution at large strains requires mechanical formulations that remain thermodynamically consistent while capturing significant lattice rotations and transformation-induced stresses. However, most existing finite-strain microelasticity and phase-field approaches apply macroscopic boundary conditions heuristically, preventing proper stress relaxation and violating the Hill-Mandel work equivalence required for homogenization. These limitations can misrepresent stress states and transformation pathways under finite strains. Here a variationally consistent finite-strain microelasticity framework is presented that couples microscopic and macroscopic mechanical equilibrium through a single energy functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange conditions, periodic micro-equilibrium and macroscopic stress balance, are solved using a staggered FFT-Newton algorithm that combines a spectral fixed-point update for local fields with a Newton step for the homogenized deformation gradient. The formulation accommodates general hyperelastic constitutive laws and arbitrary transformation gradients. Benchmarks demonstrate accurate recovery of small-strain Eshelby solutions and systematic nonlinear deviations at large dilatations. Applied to deformation twinning in magnesium, the framework reproduces lenticular morphology, stress redistribution, and faster lateral growth consistent with experiments. This approach establishes a rigorous and scalable foundation for finite-strain phase-field simulations of coherent transformations under general stress or mixed boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Vortex patterns of a 2D rotating Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical rotational speed</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bao-Duy Le, Dinh-Thi Nguyen</p>
            <p>We introduce a GPU-accelerated variational framework with exact projection onto the Lowest Landau Level to probe vortex patterns in rapidly rotating two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. For repulsive interactions, our approach faithfully reproduces Abrikosov vortex lattices, achieving quantitative alignment with Thomas-Fermi theory and the Abrikosov constant, while underscoring the profound analogy between superfluid vortex ordering and Abrikosov lattices in type-II superconductors. In the attractive regime, we reveal that weak attractions sustain stable vortex arrays, whereas stronger attractions quench vortices, trigger radial contraction, and culminate in collapse at the Gagliardo-Nirenberg threshold. These findings deliver a cohesive numerical benchmark for vortex formation and collapse dynamics, forging a rigorous link between superfluidity and superconductivity in rotating quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Numerical renormalization group integrated Hamiltonian truncation: Toward generic deformation of integrable lattice models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodong He, Xiao Wang, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>We present a hybrid lattice Hamiltonian truncation method that integrates the numerical renormalization group (NRG) with a truncated lattice integrable spectrum. The technique is tailored for generic deformations of integrable lattice models, where the NRG enables a controlled incorporation of high-energy states. The method extends the basis set more effectively and efficiently than brute-force truncation, meanwhile significantly reducing errors. We show its capability on two paradigmatic models: an Ising chain in a magnetic field and a quantum Ising ladder. The resulting dynamical structure factors accurately capture the essential low-energy physics, including the $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ excitations of the former and later models, respectively, demonstrating the approach's computational efficiency and high performance.</p>

            <p>This paper extends a field-theoretical dynamical networking formalism for mesoscopic polymer dynamics to explicitly include dedicated cross-linker particles. Cross-linkers are represented within a Martin-Siggia-Rose generating functional and reversibly coupled to polymers through Gaussian networking fields, enabling an approximation scheme that reduces their degrees of freedom while remaining compatible with polymer dynamics. The framework is applied to a two-species polymer system in which intra- and inter-species cross-linking are assigned different statistical advantages. Effective networking potentials are derived and used to calculate correlation functions and dynamic structure factors. To validate these results, molecular dynamics simulations of semi-flexible polymers with reversible intra- and inter-species cross-linking are performed. Simulations show that cross-linking decreases polymer persistence lengths and local alignment, and the resulting trajectories yield dynamic structure factors consistent with theoretical predictions. In both approaches, cross-linking broadens the diffusive peaks and enhances the high-frequency tails of the structure factors. Together, theory and simulation provide complementary insights into the dynamics of cross-linked polymers, establishing a tractable framework that captures essential features observed in experiments and offering a basis for exploring more complex synthetic and biological networks.</p>

            <h2>A tractable framework for phase transitions in phase-fluctuating disordered 2D superconductors: applications to bilayer MoS$_2$ and disordered InO$_x$ thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Starting from the purely microscopic model, we go beyond conventional mean-field theory and develop a self-consistent microscopic thermodynamic framework for disordered 2D superconductors. It incorporates the fermionic Bogoliubov quasiparticles, bosonic Nambu-Goldstone (NG) quantum and thermal phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) vortex-antivortex fluctuations on an equal footing, to self-consistently treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density. This unified phase-fluctuating description naturally recovers the previously known limiting results: the superconducting gap in the 2D limit can remain robust against long-wavelength NG phase fluctuations at $T=0^+$ due to Coulomb-induced regularization, while the gradual proliferation of BKT fluctuations as the system approaches criticality drives a separation between the global superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the gap-closing temperature $T^*$. In contrast to mean-field theory, which predicts 2D superconductivity to be independent of carrier density and non-magnetic disorder (Anderson theorem), the incorporation of phase fluctuations generates a density- and disorder-dependent zero-point gap $\Delta(0)$ and consequently $T_c$ and $T^*$. Remarkably, applications to bilayer MoS$_2$ [Nat. Nanotechnol. 14, 1123 (2019)] and disordered InO$_x$ thin films [Nat. Phys. 21, 104 (2025)] quantitatively reproduce key experimental observations in excellent agreement. The framework offers a useful theoretical tool for understanding phase-fluctuation-dominated superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of inertial active particles in a one-dimensional chain with harmonic nearest-neighbor interactions, highlighting the interplay of persistence, interaction, and inertial timescales. Using a Green's function approach, we derive the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and mean-squared change in velocity (MSCV), revealing multiple crossovers between ballistic, diffusive, and subdiffusive regimes and providing analytic expressions for scaling coefficients and crossover times. Non-Gaussian deviations in active Brownian particles are captured through excess kurtosis, reflecting heavy-tailed, finite-support, or bimodal distributions that evolve systematically over time. Time-dependent probability distributions exhibit distinct data collapses within different temporal regimes, confirming the robustness of the scaling behavior. Overall, this framework connects multiparticle interactions to microscopic dynamics, revealing experimentally accessible signatures of inertia in active matter.</p>

            <p>Lattice spin models featuring kinetic constraints constitute a paradigmatic setting for the investigation of glassiness and localization phenomena. The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations. This truncation of transition pathways often leads to a fragmentation of the Hilbert space, yielding highly collective and therefore often slow dynamics. Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement.</p>

            <h2>Spin-orbit driven $J_{eff} = 1/2$ magnetism in a d$^7$ triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Soumen Basak, Mohammad Rezwan Habib, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical and experimental advances have identified cobaltates with a high-spin $d^7$ electronic configuration as promising hosts for spin-orbit entangled $J_{eff} = 1/2$ magnetism that can support bond-dependent exchange interactions. In two-dimensional triangular lattices, the coexistence of such exchange frustration along with geometric frustration gives rise to a rich landscape of competing magnetic phases, establishing monolayer triangular $d^7$ cobaltates as a compelling platform for frustrated magnetism. Here we investigate a representative triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate CoBr$_2$, where first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping channel that enhances the ferromagnetic Kitaev-type exchange interactions. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg term is highly sensitive to a direct $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hopping path and electronic correlations. The magnetic exchange parameters are evaluated using the hopping amplitudes obtained from DFT calculations within an exact diagonalization framework. We construct the first and third nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange dependent $J_1$-$J_3$ magnetic phase diagram in the physically relevant regime and identify multiple competing ground states, including ferromagnetic, stripy, spiral, and $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic orders. The Luttinger-Tisza analysis further predicts a Z$_2$ vortex crystal phase, while exact diagonalization reveals a bond-nematic phase stabilized by the longer-range couplings. Going beyond the conventional bond-independent XXZ picture typically applied to Co$^{2+}$ systems, our results on monolayer CoBr$_2$ establish d$^7$ cobalt dihalides as a promising platform to explore the interplay of long-range Heisenberg and bond-dependent exchange interactions that can stabilize diverse magnetic ground states on a triangular lattice.</p>

            <p>Coexistence of nontrivial topology and flat electronic bands in low-energy lattices provides a fertile platform for correlated quantum states. The square-octagon lattice hosts Dirac nodes and flat bands at half-filling, yet the influence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered magnetic flux on its topological and flat-band properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine this lattice using tight-binding models that include SOC and magnetic flux, uncovering a quantum spin Hall phase with spin Chern number $C_s=1$, crossovers to quantum anomalous Hall phases with $C=1$ and $C=2$, and higher-order topological insulator phases carrying quantized quadrupolar corner charges. The initially dispersionless flat bands evolve into quasi-flat, topologically nontrivial bands with uniform quantum geometry and large flatness ratios, conducive to fractional Chern insulator states. We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $\alpha$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter.</p>

While the Lieb--Liniger gas is integrable, the impurity breaks integrability and induces a transition towards quantum chaos. We show that the low-energy spectrum exhibits random-matrix statistics, in striking contrast to the Bohigas--Giannoni--Schmit conjecture, where chaotic behavior typically emerges at high energy. For two bosons, the odd-parity sector remains integrable, whereas the even-parity sector displays clear signatures of chaos at low energy and a crossover back to quasi-integrable behavior at higher energies. For three bosons, both parity sectors exhibit spectral statistics close to chaos at low energy. We argue that this unconventional form of many-body quantum chaos originates from diffractive processes induced by the impurity.</p>

            <p>Materials with graphene-like layers attract tremendous attention due to their electronic structures and superconducting properties. In this study, we synthesized LaP2 polycrystalline and observed a superconducting transition around 30 GPa. The critical temperature Tc increases monotonically with pressure, which is nearing saturation and reaches 7.8 K at 78 GPa. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the superconducting transition originates from a structure transition to the P6/mmm phase under high pressure, suggesting the observation of graphene-like phosphorus layers in transition metal phosphides. By first-principles calculations, we provide more evidence for the stability of the graphene-like phosphorus layers in LaP2. Our findings are helpful for the understanding of the LaP2 phase diagram under high pressure, and could shed light on the research of unique structures in transition metal phosphides under high pressure.</p>

            <p>We investigate a generalized Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model with non-reciprocal hopping and power-law quasiperiodic potentials $V(i) = V\left[ \cos(2\pi \beta i) \right]^p$. Our study reveals that the interplay between nonreciprocity, quasiperiodicity, and the power-law exponent $p$ gives rise to a variety of phase transitions and localization phenomena. In the Hermitian case, the system undergoes a direct transition from extended to localized phases for $p=1, 2$, while for \(p \geq 3\), an intermediate mixed phase emerges, characterized by the coexistence of extended and localized states and the presence of mobility edges. Importantly, we find that high inverse participation ratio (IPR) states appear at specific energy levels, whose positions are accurately described by the universal relation \(x_n = n\beta - \lfloor n\beta \rfloor\), with a mirror-symmetric spatial distribution. In the non-Hermitian regime, the energy spectrum becomes complex and the \(\mathcal{PT}\) transition coincides with the extended-to-localized phase boundary for \(p = 1, 2\), whereas for \(p \geq 3\), \(\mathcal{PT}\)-symmetry breaking occurs at the mixed-to-localized phase transition. This work reveals how power-law quasiperiodic potentials and non-reciprocal hopping govern phase transitions, providing new insight into localization phenomena of quasiperiodic systems.</p>

            <p>Magnetic imaging techniques are widespread critical tools used in fields such as magnetism, spintronics or even superconductivity. Among them, one of the most versatile methods is the magneto-optical Kerr effect. However, as soon as light is blocked from interacting with the magnetic layer, such as in deeply buried layers, optical techniques become ineffective. In this work, we present a spin-accumulation based magneto-optical Kerr effect (SA-MOKE) microscopy technique that enables imaging of a magnetic thin-films covered by thick and opaque metallic layers. The technique is based on the generation and detection of transient spin-accumulations that propagate through the thick metallic layer. These spin-accumulation signals are directly triggered and detected optically on the same side, lifting any substrate transparency requirements. The spin-accumulation signals detected on a Cu layer decay with a characteristic length of 60 nm, much longer than the 12 nm optical penetration depth, allowing for detection of magnetic contrast with Cu capping layers up to hundreds of nm. This method should enable magnetic imaging in a wide-range of experiments where the surface of interest is covered by electrodes.</p>

We further extend our analysis to the $d$-wave superconductor. Our results highlight spin-lattice relaxation rate as a sensitive tool to detect the superconducting BKT transition and open routes to exploring its manifestation in unconventional pairing states.</p>

            <p>Multi-terminal Josephson junction with three or more superconductors is an attractive quantum system to emerge and tune exotic electronic states. In four terminal Josephson junctions, the Weyl physics, namely topologically protected zero energy state, emerges without assuming any exotic materials. In this study, we consider the four-terminal Josephson junction with the quantum point contact structures between the mesoscopic normal region and four superconducting terminals. The quantum point contacts can tune electrically the number of conduction channels. We theoretically investigate an effect of the increase of channels on the emergence of Weyl points. The increase of channels causes the increase of Andreev bound states in the system, which increase the emergence probability of Weyl points. When all terminals have two channels, the emergence probability is up to 17\%, which is about four times larger than that for all single channel junctions. We consider the balance of the number of conduction channels in the four terminals. When the number of channels is unbalanced, the increase of emergence probability is suppressed.</p>

            <p>Ferroelastic twin walls in centrosymmetric perovskites can host emergent polar and magnetic properties forbidden in the bulk. We use density functional theory calculations to study the geometry and magnetic properties of ferroelastic domain walls in orthorhombic CaMnO$_3$, which belongs to the most common perovskite space group, $Pnma$. At the wall, the inherent inversion symmetry-breaking induces local polar distortions dependent on the wall geometry, which couple to the magnetic order through the octahedral distortions. Noncollinear calculations reveal enhanced out-of-plane magnetic moments on the Mn atoms and a local, finite magnetization confined to the wall. Strain fields across twin walls thus give rise to coexistence of polarization and magnetization as well as magnetoelectric response that is absent and symmetry-forbidden in bulk CaMnO$_3$. We propose that magnetoelectric coupling and coexisting polarization and magnetization can emerge at twin walls in bulk centrosymmetric antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>We study the equilibrium glassy behavior of a multimode random laser model with nonlinear four-body quenched disordered interactions and a global smoothed-cubic constraint on mode intensities. This constraint, which provides a more realistic representation of gain saturation than the commonly used spherical constraint, prevents intensity condensation while preserving the dense, long-range interaction structure characteristic of many multistate random lasers. The model effective Hamiltonian is a function of mode amplitudes with random frequencies and is defined on a complete mode-locked graph. Using large-scale GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations with the Parallel Tempering algorithm, we analyze systems of varying sizes to probe their thermodynamic-limit behavior. Finite-size scaling of the specific heat, of the Parisi overlap distributions, and of the inverse participation ratio's reveals a spin-glass transition, with critical exponents matching the mean-field Random Energy Model universality class. The smoothed-cubic constraint produces broad, non-condensed intensity distributions, avoiding the pseudo-condensation seen in spherical models on the same interaction graph. Our results show that more realistic gain-saturation constraints preserve spin-glass characteristics while enabling simulations of larger, more dilute systems, providing a robust framework for studying glassy random lasers with self-starting mode-locking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luhang Yang, Adrian E. Feiguin, Thomas P. Devereaux, Elbio Dagotto</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model has attracted considerable interest due to its prototypical role in describing strongly interacting electronic systems, such as high-critical-temperature superconductors as well as many novel quantum materials. By introducing next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoppings to the Hubbard model, the phase diagram becomes richer, and fascinating phenomena arise in both, one-dimensional chains and square lattices, such as: antiferromagnetism (AFM), ferromagnetism (FM), superconductivity (SC), as well as charge orders, among others. Moreover, NNN hoppings play a fundamental role in understanding effects of doping on magnetism and pairing orders in strongly interacting regimes. In this article, we review the recent progress in understanding the different competing phases of this model in one and two dimensions from a computational perspective. We comment on the pressing technical challenges, illustrate the controversial results concerning the emergence of the SC phase, and conclude with our perspectives on future explorations.</p>

            <h2>First Principles study of Photocatalytic Water Splitting in BO Monolayer: Effect of Strain and Surface Functionalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumendra Kumar Das, Smruti Ranjan Parida, Prasanjit Samal, Brahmananda Chakraborty, Sridhar Sahu</p>
            <p>Light element based two dimensional (2D) materials are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Boron oxide (BO) is a recently synthesized 2D monolayer which has yet to be thoroughly explored for its potential applications. In this article, using first principles calculations, we report, for the first time, the visible-light photocatalytic activity of a BO monolayer for water splitting under mechanical strain and surface modification with single- and double-atom decorations (C, N, Si, Ge, P, As). The pristine BO monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap of 3.8 eV with band edges spanning the water redox potentials, but its optical absorption lies in the UV region (~ 4.5 eV). Strain engineering tunes the band gap and band alignment with a minimal shifting in the optical absorption (~0.5 eV). Single atom decoration produces a metallic state for elements like N, P, As, and an insulating state for single C, Si, Ge with a partial shifting in optical absorption. In contrast, double atom decoration produces substantial band gap reduction, improved band alignment, a pronounced red-shift in optical absorption into the visible range (1.6 to 3.2 eV) thus satisfying the criteria for water splitting. The stability of all the adsorbed configurations was confirmed by negative formation energy and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings suggest BO monolayer functionalization can improve photocatalytic efficiency, providing hydrogen generation insights.</p>

            <p>We carry out uniaxial continuous and step stretching of various crosslinked polymer networks to demonstrate how characteristics of rupture (from continuous stretching) and delayed rupture (from step stretching) can be used to probe the structure of the emergent kinetic theory of bond dissociation (KTBD) for elastomeric failure. Based on delayed rupture experiments, we show that the network lifetime tntw, taken as the incubation time for delayed rupture, depends on temperature in an Arrhenius like manner and is exponentially sensitive to the degree of network stretching (depicted by step-stretch ratio ). Rupture during continuous stretching for a wide range of stretch rates takes place on timescales inversely proportional to the stretch rate. The elapsed time at rupture is found to be comparable to at various values of L/L0b = L/L0ss in a wide range of temperature, affording the experimental basis for the premise of the KTBD. Having identified the hidden internal clock , continuous stretching tests at different temperatures are performed to show the existence of a new time temperature equivalence (TTE): fast stretching at higher temperatures is equivalent to slow stretching at lower temperatures: different pairs of rate and temperature can produce the rupture at the same tensile strength and strain.</p>

            <h2>Density of reflection resonances in one-dimensional disordered Schrödinger operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan V. Fyodorov, Jan Meibohm</p>
            <p>We develop an analytic approach to evaluating the density $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$ of complex resonance poles with real energies $\mathcal{E}$ and widths $\Gamma$ in the pure reflection problem from a one-dimensional disordered sample with white-noise random potential. We start with establishing a general link between the density of resonances and the distribution of the reflection coefficient $r=|R(E,L)|^2$, where $R(E,L)$ is the reflection amplitude, at {\it complex} energies $E = {\cal E} +i\eta$, identifying the parameter $\eta>0$ with the uniform rate of absorption within the disordered medium. We show that leveraging this link allows for a detailed analysis of the resonance density in the weak disorder limit. In particular, for a (semi)infinite sample, it yields an explicit formula for $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$, describing the crossover from narrow to broad resonances in a unified way. Similarly, our approach yields a limiting formula for $\rho ({\cal E},\Gamma)$ in the opposite case of a short disordered sample, with size much smaller than the localization length. This regime seems to have not been systematically addressed in the literature before, with the corresponding analysis requiring an accurate and rather non-trivial implementation of WKB-like asymptotics in the scattering problem. Finally, we study the resonance statistics numerically for the one-dimensional Anderson tight-binding model and compare the results with our analytic expressions.</p>

            <h2>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Type and Laughlin-Type Argument for the Quantum Hall Effect in Lattice Fermions with Spiral Boundary Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masaaki Nakamura, Masanori Yamanaka</p>
            <p>We derive the condition for the occurrence of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems, expressed as $\phi\nu-\rho\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $\phi$, $\nu$, and $\rho$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly containing redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be manipulated by a factor of the system size.</p>

            <h2>A High-Efficiency Three-Stroke Quantum Isochoric Heat Engine: From Infinite Potential Wells to Magic Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hadi Mohammed Soufy, Colin Benjamin</p>
            <p>We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the behavior of the Schmidt gap, the von Neumann entanglement entropy, and the non-stabiliserness in proximity to the classical phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model (LRTFIM). Leveraging the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) within a tensor-network formulation, we simulate thermal states through their purified tensor-network representations. Our results show that these observables, typically regarded as hallmarks of quantum criticality, exhibit pronounced and coherent signatures even at a classical thermal transition, highlighting the emergence of quantum complexity as the system nears thermal criticality.</p>

            <p>Collective excitations in one-dimensional (1D) quantum fluids are expected to propagate almost without dissipation. Here we directly excite phonon modes in a weakly interacting 1D Bose gas and study their time evolution. In the linear response regime, damping is surprisingly fast and quantitatively follows the non-analytic scaling predicted by Andreev's hydrodynamic description. For stronger excitations, we observe a crossover to a highly nonlinear regime characterized by wave breaking, captured by the finite-temperature nonlinear Schrödinger evolution. Our results resolve a long-standing question on the fate of phonons in 1D Bose gases, and open new pathways to study non-linear relaxation in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Developing large-scale foundational datasets is a critical milestone in advancing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scientific innovation. However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the "more is better" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Grain Growth in Polycrystalline Materials Using Deep Learning Time Series Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliane Younes, Elie Hachem, Marc Bernacki</p>
            <p>Grain Growth strongly influences the mechanical behavior of materials, making its prediction a key objective in microstructural engineering. In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time. These results highlight the potential of low-dimensional descriptors and LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and accurate microstructure prediction, with direct implications for digital twin development and process optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liqin Tan, Pin Chen, Menghan Liu, Xiean Wang, Jianhuan Cen, Qingsong Zou</p>
            <p>We present MatUQ, a benchmark framework for evaluating graph neural networks (GNNs) on out-of-distribution (OOD) materials property prediction with uncertainty quantification (UQ). MatUQ comprises 1,375 OOD prediction tasks constructed from six materials datasets using five OFM-based and a newly proposed structure-aware splitting strategy, SOAP-LOCO, which captures local atomic environments more effectively. We evaluate 12 representative GNN models under a unified uncertainty-aware training protocol that combines Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Evidential Regression (DER), and introduce a novel uncertainty metric, D-EviU, which shows the strongest correlation with prediction errors in most tasks. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, the uncertainty-aware training approach significantly improves model prediction accuracy, reducing errors by an average of 70.6\% across challenging OOD scenarios. Second, the benchmark reveals that no single model dominates universally: earlier models such as SchNet and ALIGNN remain competitive, while newer models like CrystalFramer and SODNet demonstrate superior performance on specific material properties. These results provide practical insights for selecting reliable models under distribution shifts in materials discovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christina Schenk, Miguel Hernández-del-Valle, Luis Calero-Lumbreras, Marcus Noack, Maciej Haranczyk</p>
            <p>Device-to-device variability in experimental noise critically impacts reproducibility, especially in automated, high-throughput systems like additive manufacturing farms. While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability. Overall, this framework establishes a paradigm for precision- and resource-aware optimization in scalable, automated experimental platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin V. Bigting, Shubhadeep Nag, Yaxin An</p>
            <p>Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($\Delta G_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{this https URL}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.</p>

            <p>We present a non-perturbative Hamiltonian mapping method for quantum systems strongly coupled to a quantized field mode (cavity), yielding compact closed-form representations of hybrid light-matter systems. The mapping method builds on an entangling transformation of photonic and atomic degrees of freedom. By truncating the resulting cavity-dressed Hamiltonian (CDH) to successively larger excitation sectors, we construct a series of compact models that converge to the exact limit, outpacing conventional approaches even in the challenging resonant and ultrastrong light-matter regime. The mapping principle also applies to multimode cavities coupled to matter through noncommuting operators and to leaky cavities. We benchmark the CDH framework on the quantum Rabi model, demonstrating accurate spectral predictions in both weak and strong coupling regimes, together with converging ground-state and thermal observables. We study the Dicke-Heisenberg lattice model and determine its phase diagram under resonant and strong light-matter coupling, achieving significant computational savings over brute-force simulations and identifying cavity-mediated spin correlations both analytically and numerically. The closed-form and compactness of the CDH provide both physical insight and enhanced computational efficiency, facilitating studies of strongly coupled hybrid light-matter systems.</p>

            <p>We study the high-dimensional inference of a rank-one signal corrupted by sparse noise. The noise is modelled as the adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph with finite average connectivity in the large size limit. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we analytically compute the typical value of the top eigenvalue, the top eigenvector component density, and the overlap between the signal vector and the top eigenvector. The solution is given in terms of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. Specialising the noise matrix to Poissonian and Random Regular degree distributions, the critical signal strength is analytically identified at which a transition happens for the recovery of the signal via the top eigenvector, thus generalising the celebrated BBP transition to the sparse noise case. In the large-connectivity limit, known results for dense noise are recovered. Analytical results are in agreement with numerical diagonalisation of large matrices.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the ground state of a spin-1 XXZ chain with uniaxial anisotropies, single-ion anisotropy $D$ and Ising anisotropy $J$, within the Haldane phase can serve as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation implementing single-qubit gates. The gate fidelity of both elementary rotation gates and general single-qubit unitary gates composed of rotations about the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes is evaluated, and is found to exceed 0.99 when $D$ or $J$ is appropriately tuned. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the rotation-gate fidelity under the assumption that the state lies within the $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$-protected Haldane phase, showing that it is determined by the post-measurement spin-spin correlation function and the failure probability. The observed enhancement of gate fidelity in the spin-1 XXZ chain originates from the strengthening of antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations near the AFM phase, which effectively suppresses failure states.</p>

            <p>We apply preference learning to the task of language model-guided design of novel structural alloys. In contrast to prior work that focuses on generating stable inorganic crystals, our approach targets the synthesizeability of a specific structural class: BCC/B2 superalloys, an underexplored family of materials with potential applications in extreme environments. Using three open-weight models (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and OLMo-2), we demonstrate that language models can be optimized for multiple design objectives using a single, unified reward signal through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or human-in-the-loop feedback (costly), our reward signal is derived from thermodynamic phase calculations, offering a scientifically grounded criterion for model tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of preference-tuning a language model using physics-grounded feedback for structural alloy design. The resulting framework is general and extensible, providing a path forward for intelligent design-space exploration across a range of physical science domains.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate many-body phase transitions in a one-dimensional anisotropic XY model subject to a complex-valued transverse field. Within the biorthogonal framework, we calculate the ground-state correlation functions and entanglement entropy, confirming that their scaling behavior remains identical to that in the Hermitian XY model. The preservation of Hermitian phase transition features in the non-Hermitian setting is rooted in the persistence and emergence of symmetries and their breaking. Specifically, the ferromagnetic (FM) phase arises from the breaking of a $Z_2$ symmetry, while the Luttinger liquid (LL) phase is enabled by the emergence of a $U(1)$ symmetry together with the degeneracy of the real part of the energy spectrum. The nontrivial topology of the LL phase are characterized by the winding number around the exceptional point (EP). Given that non-Hermitian systems are inherently open, this research opens a new avenue for exploring conventional quantum phase transitions that are typically vulnerable to decoherence and environmental disruption in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Doru Sticlet, Romulus Tetean, Coriolan Tiusan</p>
            <p>Quantum computation departs from the classical paradigm of deterministic, bit-based processing by exploiting inherently quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. We propose a framework for qubit realization based on skyrmionic states stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in two-dimensional spin lattices. The model incorporates competing exchange interactions, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and Zeeman coupling, solved via exact diagonalization under periodic (PBC) and open boundary conditions (OBC). A quantum skyrmionic phase emerges for PBC within a parameter space defined by DMI, exchange, field, and anisotropy, while OBC favor classical-like, topologically protected skyrmions. Quantum logic gates (Pauli X, Y, Z, Hadamard) are implemented on both skyrmion types. Energy density and entanglement entropy analyses reveal that quantum skyrmions suffer from DMI-driven decoherence and reduced gate fidelity, whereas classical-like skyrmions maintain stability. Exact simulations of qubit dynamics, including drive effects and Lindblad decoherence, demonstrate tunable anharmonic energy levels and coherent Bloch-sphere manipulation, making these skyrmionic states promising candidates for qubit implementation. Overall, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction plays a dual role-stabilizing skyrmionic qubits while simultaneously inducing decoherence during gate operations.</p>

Integration of lithium niobate into optical devices, however, is hampered by significant top-down fabrication challenges due to its exceptional chemical resistance. Scalable fabrication methods that preserve material quality while reducing fabrication complexity and cost are, therefore, crucial to advancing lithium niobate devices. We present a photochemical metal-organic decomposition technique for the scalable patterning of lithium niobate at ambient conditions, eliminating the need for harsh etching conditions and cleanroom protocols. The method utilizes a solution of a custom-prepared photosensitive organometallic precursor as a negative photoresist. The UV light exposure of the thin films of the precursor through a photomask, followed by rinsing with ethanol, yields amorphous patterns, which transform into crystalline lithium niobate after a calcination step. This method enables a scalable fabrication of a range of complex geometric shapes with a feature resolution down to $30\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. The patterned lithium niobate structures exhibit a tunable second harmonic generation activity with an isotropic optical response. This approach offers a scalable and low-cost pathway for manufacturing lithium niobate photonics and the potential to fabricate other materials (e.g., barium titanite and lithium tantalate).</p>

            <h2>Universalities in the Avalanche Dynamics of Novelties and Non-Novelties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Santoro, Alberto Petri, Francesca Tria</p>
            <p>Unprecedented events intertwine with the repetition of the past in natural phenomena and human activities. Key statistical patterns, such as Heaps' and Taylor's laws and Zipf's law, have been identified as characterizing the dynamical processes that govern the emergence of novelties and the abundance of repeated elements. Observing these statistical regularities has been pivotal in motivating the search for modeling schemes that can explain them and clarify key mechanisms underlying the appearance of new elements and their subsequent recurrence. In this study, we analyze sequences of novel and non-novel elements, referred to as avalanches, in real-world systems. We show that avalanche statistics provide a complementary characterization of innovation dynamics, extending beyond the three fundamental laws mentioned above. Although arising from collective dynamics, some systems behave as a single instance of a stochastic process. Others, such as natural language, exhibit features that we can only explain by a superposition of different dynamics. This distinction is not apparent when considering Heaps' law alone, while it clearly emerges in the avalanche statistics. By interpreting these empirical observations, we also advance the theoretical understanding of urn-based models that successfully reproduce the observed behaviors associated with Heaps', Zipf's, and Taylor's laws. We derive analytical expressions that accurately describe the probability distributions of avalanches and the Heaps law beyond its asymptotic regime. Building on these results, we derive a scaling relation that we show also holds in real-world systems, indicating a form of universality in the dynamics of novelty.</p>

            <h2>Dissipative Dynamics of Charged Graphene Quantum Batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Disha Verma, Indrajith VS, R. Sankaranarayanan</p>
            <p>We investigate dissipative dynamics in a graphene-based quantum battery modeled as a four level spin valley system. The battery is charged via a Gaussian pulse and subsequently evolves under amplitude damping, dephasing, and both Markovian and non Markovian reservoirs. We find that amplitude damping, while inducing energy loss, can stabilize non passive steady states with finite ergotropy, whereas pure dephasing suppresses coherence and eliminates work extraction. On the other hand, non-Markovian memory slows ergotropy loss and enables partial recovery through information backflow. These results identify coherence and reservoir memory as essential resources for enhancing the long-time performance of graphene quantum batteries.</p>

            <h2>Moments of quantum channel ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Duschenes, Diego García-Martín, Zoë Holmes, M. Cerezo</p>
            <p>Moments of ensembles of unitaries play a central role in quantum information theory as they capture the statistical properties of dynamics of systems with some form of randomness. Indeed, concepts such as approximate $t$-designs arise when comparing how close an associated moment operator of a given unitary ensemble is to that of another, reference ensemble. Despite the importance of moment operators, their properties have not been as explored for quantum channels. In this work we develop a theoretical framework to compute moment operators for ensembles of quantum channels, for all moment orders $t$, with a special focus on determining ensembles that can be used as points of reference. By deriving hierarchies between ensembles, via inequalities of their moment operator norms, we give them operational meaning, and define useful concepts such as that of channel $t$-designs. Finally, we perform theoretical and numerical studies which show that different types of noise can decrease the norm of the moment operators (e.g., depolarizing noise), as well as increase it (e.g., amplitude damping), and generalize noise-induced concentration phenomena to channel-design-induced phenomena. Along the way, we find a block-orthogonal basis for permutations, which greatly simplifies our analyses, and may be of independent interest.</p>

            <h2>Orientations of Orbi-K-Theory measuring Topological Phases and Brane Charges</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber</p>
            <p>Topological Chern phases of quantum materials, as well as brane charges on M-theory orbifolds, have famously been argued to be classified by (orbi) topological K-theory, or possibly by other stable and, notably, complex-oriented cohomology theories, such as elliptic cohomology or Morava K-theory. However, closer inspection reveals that the most fine-grained "fragile" microscopic classification in both cases is in (orbi) Cohomotopy, which is the primordial "unstable" or nonabelian generalized cohomology. Coarsening takes the latter (fragile) to the former (stable) cohomology along an nonabelian cohomology operations. But what then is the role of complex orientation on the stable side? We observe here (i) that over gapped nodal lines in the 2D Brillouin torus and on probe M5-branes in 11D spacetime, the cohomotopical phases/charges lift through the complex/quaternionic Hopf fibration, and (ii) that measuring this fragile situation in stable cohomology means equivalently to ask for universal complex/quaternionic orientation on stable cohomology in four/ten dimensions! Then we give an explicit realization of such unstable four/ten-dimensional complex/quaternionic orientation in U(2)/Sp(2)-equivariant K-theory, using real division-algebraic tools within a new model of twisted orbifold K-theory in cohesive homotopy theory; and we explain this as an extraordinary character map from orbi Cohomotopy-twisted Cohomotopy to relative orbi K-theory. Finally, we discuss an application to the classification of 2-band crystalline topological insulator phases sensitive to the topology in the gapping process of their nodal line semimetal parent phase, and to the measurement of M-string charges inside M5-brane probes.</p>

            <h2>DIVIDE: A Framework for Learning from Independent Multi-Mechanism Data Using Deep Encoders and Gaussian Processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Chawla, Boris Slautin, Utkarsh Pratiush, Dayakar Penumadu, Sergei Kalinin</p>
            <p>Scientific datasets often arise from multiple independent mechanisms such as spatial, categorical or structural effects, whose combined influence obscures their individual contributions. We introduce DIVIDE, a framework that disentangles these influences by integrating mechanism-specific deep encoders with a structured Gaussian Process in a joint latent space. Disentanglement here refers to separating independently acting generative factors. The encoders isolate distinct mechanisms while the Gaussian Process captures their combined effect with calibrated uncertainty. The architecture supports structured priors, enabling interpretable and mechanism-aware prediction as well as efficient active learning. DIVIDE is demonstrated on synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches with nonlinear spatial fields, on FerroSIM spin lattice simulations of ferroelectric patterns, and on experimental PFM hysteresis loops from PbTiO3 films. Across benchmarks, DIVIDE separates mechanisms, reproduces additive and scaled interactions, and remains robust under noise. The framework extends naturally to multifunctional datasets where mechanical, electromagnetic or optical responses coexist.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristina Bukina, Dima L. Shepelyansky</p>
            <p>We study the process of opinion formation in an Ising social network of scientific collaborations. The network is undirected. An Ising spin is associated with each network node being oriented up (red) or down (blue). Certain nodes carry fixed, opposite opinions whose influence propagates over the other spins, which are flipped according to the majority-influence opinion of neighbors of a given spin during the asynchronous Monte Carlo process. The amplitude influence of each spin is self-consistently adapted, and a flip occurs only if this majority influence exceeds a certain conviction threshold. All non-fixed spins are initially randomly distributed, with half of them oriented up and half down. Such a system can be viewed as a model of elite influence, coming from the fixed spins, on the opinions of the crowd of non-fixed spins. We show that a phase transition occurs as the amplitude influence of the crowd spins increases: the dominant opinion shifts from that of the elite nodes to a phase in which the crowd spins' opinion becomes dominant and the elite can no longer impose their views.</p>

            <h2>A Global Spacetime Optimization Approach to the Real-Space Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enze Hou, Yuzhi Liu, Lei Wang, Han Wang</p>
            <p>The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) in real space is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems, with applications ranging from quantum chemistry to condensed matter physics and materials science. However, solving the TDSE for complex fermionic systems remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the need to capture the time-evolving many-body correlations, while the antisymmetric nature of fermionic wavefunctions complicates the function space in which these solutions must be represented. We propose a general-purpose neural network framework for solving the real-space TDSE, Fermionic Antisymmetric Spatio-Temporal Network, which treats time as an explicit input alongside spatial coordinates, enabling a unified spatiotemporal representation of complex, antisymmetric wavefunctions for fermionic systems. This approach formulates the TDSE as a global optimization problem, avoiding step-by-step propagation and supporting highly parallelizable training. The method is demonstrated on four benchmark problems: a 1D harmonic oscillator, interacting fermions in a time-dependent harmonic trap, 3D hydrogen orbital dynamics, and a laser-driven H$_2$ molecule, achieving excellent agreement with reference solutions across all cases. These results confirm our method's scalability, accuracy, and flexibility across various dimensions and interaction regimes, while demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate long-time dynamics in complex systems. Our framework offers a highly expressive alternative to traditional basis-dependent or mean-field methods, opening new possibilities for ab initio simulations of time-dependent quantum systems, with applications in quantum dynamics, molecular control, and ultrafast spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenjiang Zhao, Zhihua Zheng, Zhiyi Xu, Xing Ran, Xiaolong Yao, Fangping Ouyang</p>
            <p>High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Li, Yuhui Li, Jianzhao Wu, Luxuan Zhang, Maoyuan Li, Chaochao Wu, Zhenzhong Wang</p>
            <p>Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</p>

            <p>The recent experimental characterization of B80- via photoelectron spectroscopy stimulated renewed interest in exploring B80 clusters. Here, a D3h-symmetric B80 bilayer structure has been proposed using density functional theory calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the bilayer structure maintain its structural integrity up to 1400 K, indicating superior thermodynamic stability compared to previously known B80 configurations, including the B80 buckyball and volleyball-like structures. Vibrational frequency analysis confirms its kinetic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveals a HOMO-LUMO gap of 0.72 eV and pronounced aromaticity, further supported by a nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS(0)) value of -44.3 ppm in the interlayer B-B bonds. The simulated photoelectron spectrum of the B80- bilayer reproduces key experimental features, with vertical detachment energies agreeing with experimental peaks within 0.04 eV. These findings support the potential existence of this bilayer configuration, and enrich the structural diversity of boron clusters, offering promising prospects for applications in nanoscale electronics.</p>

            <p>Pushing nanoscale optical confinement to its ultimate limits defines the regime of nano-cavity quantum electrodynamics (nano-cQED), where light--matter interactions approach the fundamental quantum limits of individual atoms, e.g., picocavities. However, realizing such extreme confinement in a stable and controllable manner remains a key challenge. Here, we introduce a van der Waals material-based nano-cQED platform by coupling monolayer MoS2 excitons to plasmonic sub-nanocavities formed via assembly of ultrasmall gold clusters (3-5 nm) in the nanogap of a nanoparticle-on-mirror nanocavity. These clusters emulate the field-confining role of atomic protrusions of the picocavities through a resonance-insensitive lightning-rod effect, achieving deep-subwavelength mode volumes. In this nano-cQED testbed, we observe pronounced multi-branch Rabi splittings and ultrastrong lower-branch polaritonic photoluminescence with up to 10^4-fold enhancement. This deterministic architecture provides a controllable pathway to access picocavity-like behavior and opens new opportunities for single-molecule spectroscopy and the exploration of nano-cQED.</p>

            <h2>Floquet Recurrences in the Double Kicked Top</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale</p>
            <p>We study exact quantum recurrences in the double kicked top (DKT), a driven spin model that extends the quantum kicked top (QKT) by introducing an additional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kick. Reformulating its dynamics in terms of effective parameters $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, we analytically show exact periodicity of the Floquet operator for $k_r = j\pi/2$ and $k_r = j\pi/4$ with distinct periods for integer and half-odd integer $j$. These exact recurrences were found to be independent of $k_\theta$. The long-time-averaged entanglement and fidelity rate function show dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) for $k_r = j\pi/2$ at time-reversal symmetric cases $k_\theta = \pm k_r$. In the other time-reversal symmetric case $k_\theta = 0$, the DQPT exists only for a half-odd integer $j$. Using level statistics, a smooth transition is observed from integrable to non-integrable nature as $k_r$ is changed away from $j\pi/2$. Our work demonstrates that regular and chaotic regimes can be controlled for any system size by tuning $k_r$ and $k_\theta$, making the DKT a useful platform for quantum control and information processing applications.</p>

            <p>The projection-based wave function (WF)-in-DFT embedding enables an efficient description of both the energetics and properties of large and complex chemical systems, with accuracy exceeding that of pure DFT. Recently, we have proposed using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as the WF method for molecules containing strongly correlated fragments [Beran, P. et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 3, 716-722]. In this work, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the DMRG-in-DFT approach is primarily limited by the approximate treatment of the coupling between the active component and its environment through nonadditive exchange-correlation functionals. To address this issue, we combine exact exchange to reduce the nonadditive exchange error with a multireference adiabatic connection (AC) scheme to recover nonadditive correlation. The performance of the improved DMRG-in-DFT embedding is illustrated on two prototypical strongly correlated systems: the dissociation of the H20 chain and the cleavage of a triple CN bond in propionitrile.</p>

            <p>Flow networks are fundamental for understanding systems such as animal and plant vasculature or power distribution grids. These networks can encode, transmit, and transform information embodied in the spatial and temporal distribution of their flows. In this work, we focus on a minimal yet physically grounded system that allows us to isolate the fundamental mechanisms by which active flow networks generate and regulate emergent dynamics capable of supporting information transmission. The system is composed of active units that pump fluid and elastic units that store volume. From first principles, we derive a discrete model-an active flow network-that enables the simulation of large systems with many interacting units. Numerically, we show that the pressure field can develop solitary waves, resulting in the spontaneous creation and transmission of localized packets of information stored in the physical properties of the flow. We characterize how these solitary waves emerge from disordered initial conditions in a one-dimensional network, and how their size and propagation speed depend on key system parameters. Finally, when the elastic units are coupled to their neighbors, the solitary waves exhibit even richer dynamics, with diverse shapes and finite lifetimes that display power-law behaviors that we can predict analytically. Together, these results show how simple fluidic elements can collectively create, shape and transport information, laying the foundations for understanding-and ultimately engineering-information processing in active flow systems.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Detlef Lehmann</p>
            <p>We apply the methodology of our recent paper 'The Dynamics of the Hubbard Model through Stochastic Calculus and Girsanov Transformation' [1] to thermodynamic correlation functions in the Fermi-Hubbard model. They can be obtained from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) system. To this SDE system, a Girsanov transformation can be applied. This has the effect that the usual determinant or pfaffian which shows up in a pfaffian quantum Monte Carlo (PfQMC) representation [2] basically gets absorbed into the new integration variables and information from that pfaffian moves into the drift part of the transformed SDE system. While the PfQMC representation depends heavily on the choice of how the quartic interaction has been factorized into quadratic quantities in the beginning, the Girsanov transformed formula has the very remarkable property that it is nearly independent of that choice, the drift part of the transformed SDE system as well as a remaining exponential which has the obvious meaning of energy are always the same and do not depend on the Hubbard-Stratonovich details. The resulting formula may serve as a starting point for further theoretical or numerical investigations. Here we consider the spin-spin correlation at half-filling on a bipartite lattice and obtain an analytical proof that the signs of these correlations have to be of antiferromagnetic type, at arbitrary temperatures. Also, by checking against available benchmark data [3], we find that approximate ground state energies can be obtained from an ODE system. This may even hold for exact ground state energies, but future work would be required to prove or disprove this. As in [1], the methodology is generic and can be applied to arbitrary quantum many body or quantum field theoretical models.</p>

            <p>We continue the investigation of symmetries and anomalies of $T[M]$ theories obtained by compactifying 6d SCFTs on an internal manifold $M$. We extend the notion of "polarizations on a manifold $M$" to cases where $M$ may have boundaries or defects. Through examples with $M$ of dimension two, three, and four, we illustrate recurring themes in compactifications -- for instance, the important roles played by Kaluza-Klein modes, and how the generalized symmetries (including higher-group and non-invertible ones) of $T[M]$, together with their anomalies, arise from non-trivial combinations of the parent 6d symmetries and the geometric structures of the internal manifold. For each dimension, we also focus on several topics that are especially interesting in that setting. These include: for 2-manifolds, the geometry of the "full moduli space" of $T[M_2]$ and its interaction with polarizations and symmetries; for 3-manifolds, the effect of torsion in homology on the spectrum of line operators in $T[M_3]$, together with applications to the study of quantum invariants such as $\hat Z_a(M_3, q)$; and for 4-manifolds, predictions for VOA$[M_4]$ following from symmetries of $T[M_4]$, as well as the construction of a new invariant of 4-manifolds that depends on two "$q$-parameters." Along the way, we discuss a range of topics that are of independent interest, such as how non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions can become invertible under compactification, how to classify defects in quantum field theory via their response to a change of framing, and the interplay between $\hat Z_a$ and volume conjectures.</p>

Their nonlinear optical effects and other characteristics also make them suitable for integration into waveguide components, such as optical fibers, for applications like optical modulation. Although some efforts have been made to integrate perovskite nanomaterials with optical fibers, technological challenges have hindered reliable in-situ preparation methods. Herein, we propose an area-selective wetting strategy for optical fibers, which utilizes hydrophobic sidewalls and hydrophilic end facets to reliably hold small precursor droplets. By introducing a space confinement strategy to suppress the kinetics of solvent evaporation, Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) perovskite single crystals were successfully grown in-situ on the fiber end facet. The versatility of this in-situ growth method for single crystals on fiber end facets of various sizes has also been verified. In a separate approach, the controllable in-situ preparation of CsPbBr3 polycrystalline thin films was achieved through vacuum-assisted rapid crystallization. Our strategy provides a controllable platform for the integration of perovskite materials and optical fibers, enabling further development in optical applications.</p>

            <p>Gauging fermion parity and summing over spin structures are subtly distinct operations. We introduce 'bosonisation cohomology' groups $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ to capture this difference, for theories in spacetime dimension $d$ equipped with maps to some $X$. Non-trivial classes in $H_B^{d+2}(X)$ contain theories for which $(-1)^F$ is anomaly-free, but spin structure summation is anomalous. We formulate a sequence of cobordism groups whose failure to be exact is measured by $H_B^{d+2}(X)$, and from here we compute it for $X=\text{pt}$. The result is non-trivial only in dimensions $d\in 4\mathbb{Z}+2$, being due to the presence of gravitational anomalies. The first few are $H_B^4=\mathbb{Z}_2$, probed by a theory of 8 Majorana-Weyl fermions in $d=2$, then $H_B^8=\mathbb{Z}_8$, $H_B^{12}=\mathbb{Z}_{16}\times \mathbb{Z}_2$. We rigorously derive a general formula extending this to every spacetime dimension. Along the way, we compile many general facts about (fermionic and bosonic) anomaly polynomials, and about spin and pin$^-$ (co)bordism generators, that we hope might serve as a useful reference for physicists working with these objects. We briefly discuss some physics applications, including how the $H_B^{12}$ class is trivialised in supergravity. Despite the name, and notation, we make no claim that $H_B^\bullet(X)$ actually defines a cohomology theory (in the Eilenberg-Steenrod sense).</p>

            <h2>Impact of Exchange-Correlation Functionals on Predictions of Phonon Hydrodynamics: A Study of Fluorides, Chlorides, and Hydrides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jamal Abou Haibeh, Samuel Huberman</p>
            <p>We employ density functional theory calculations to examine the effect of various exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, including the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE), the modified Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBESOL), and the local density approximation (LDA), on the electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties of sodium fluoride (NaF), lithium fluoride (LiF), potassium fluoride (KF), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), lithium hydride (LiH), sodium hydride (NaH), and potassium hydride (KH). The lattice thermal conductivity is computed based on an iterative solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Based on Guyer's criterion and direct solutions to the linearized BTE, we determine the ballistic, phonon hydrodynamics and diffusive regimes as function of length scale and temperature. In addition to confirming previous predictions of phonon hydrodynamics in NaF and LiF, we report novel predictions of phonon hydrodynamics in NaH, LiH, KH, KF, NaCl and KCl. The impact of isotopes on the calculated lattice thermal conductivity and phonon hydrodynamics windows is also reported. The impact of Meta-GGA and hybrid functionals is also discussed. We find that the selection of a functional impacts the prediction of thermal conductivity and the window for observation of phonon hydrodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurent Bugnon, Christian Bernhard, Premysl Marsik</p>
            <p>We present a broad band (THz to UV) ellipsometry study of the anisotropic dielectric response of the orthorhombic perovskite YAlO3. The ellipsometric measurements have been performed on YAlO3 crystals with three different surface cuts and for six high symmetry configurations of the crystal axes with respect to the plane of incidence of the photons. The obtained data are presented in terms of the Mueller Matrix elements N, C, and S and their features are analyzed and discussed with respect to the anisotropy of the dielectric response tensor. In particular, in the infrared range we have identified all 25 infrared active phonon modes that have been predicted from theoretical studies. We also discuss a negative refraction effect that naturally occurs in the vicinity of an anisotropic longitudinal-optical phonon. Moreover, we have determined the temperature dependence of the phonon parameters between 10 and 330 K. The dielectric response above the phonon range, from about 0.1 to 6.5 eV, is shown to be featureless and characteristic of an insulator with a large band gap above 6.5 eV and is well described by anisotropic Cauchy model.</p>

            <h2>Dirac Electrons in AC-Magnetic Fields: $π$-Landau Levels and Chiral Anomaly-Induced Homodyne Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sota Kitamura, Takashi Oka</p>
            <p>Floquet engineering, which involves controlling systems through time-periodic driving, is a method for coherently manipulating quantum materials and realizing dynamical states with novel functionalities. Most research in solid-state systems has focused on the use of AC-electric fields as the controlling drive. In this study, we investigate the effects of AC-magnetic fields on two-dimensional (2D) Dirac electrons and report the emergence of new states and new transport phenomena. In a magnetic field that temporarily changes its direction, the 2D Dirac electrons form a new localized state with a flat band dispersion, dubbed as a $\pi$-Landau level. Its wave function is a superposition of the clockwise and counterclockwise cyclotron orbits with time-periodic amplitudes, resulting in a novel closed trajectory shaped like a figure eight. Then, what would be the counterpart of the Hall effect in AC-magnetic fields? We find that a DC-current in the transverse direction, i.e. a homodyne Hall current, is generated when an additional AC-electric field is applied. In the case of Dirac electrons, several electronic states contribute to this phenomenon including the $\pi$-Landau level. However, when the chemical potential $\mu$ is near the Dirac point, the dominant contribution comes from the low-energy electrons and we numerically find the homodyne Hall current to behave as $I_y=-\frac{e}{h}\mu$ per valley and spin. We explain this phenomenon through the high-frequency effective Floquet Hamiltonian which resembles the chiral Landau level Hamiltonian of three-dimensional Weyl Hamiltonian exhibiting chiral anomaly. We discuss the experimental feasibility and conclude that it is possible to realize this new exotic state using techniques such as THz metamaterial enhancement of magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Structural Relaxation in Simple Yield Stress Materials Influences Their Rheology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kasra Farain, Daniel Bonn</p>
            <p>Simple yield stress materials are composed of soft particles, bubbles, or droplets with purely repulsive forces. The constituent elements are typically too large to undergo thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the internal structure of the material, and therefore the rheology, should not change over time. We explore the rheology of Carbopol, a prototypical simple yield stress material, and show that gradual structural relaxation of the material results in a small yet significant reduction in the dynamic yield stress. This relaxation process can lead to a non-monotonic creep deformation rate under constant stress, culminating in delayed fluidization of the material. These findings show that the yield stress is not merely a static material property but may be a function of the internal structure of the material.</p>

            <h2>Quantum phase diagrams of Dicke-Ising models by a wormhole algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anja Langheld, Max Hörmann, Kai Phillip Schmidt</p>
            <p>We gain quantitative insights on effects of light-matter interactions on correlated quantum matter by quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We introduce a wormhole algorithm for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising model which combines the light-matter interaction of the Dicke model with Ising interactions. The quantum phase diagram for ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions on the chain and the square lattice is determined. The occurring superradiant phase transitions are in the same universality class as the Dicke model leading to a well-known peculiar finite-size scaling that we elucidate in terms of scaling above the upper critical dimension. For the ferromagnetic case, the transition between the normal and the superradiant phase is of second order with Dicke criticality (first order) for large (small) longitudinal fields separated by a multicritical point. For antiferromagnetic interactions, we establish the light-matter analogue of a lattice supersolid with off-diagonal superradiant and diagonal magnetic order and determine the nature of all transition lines.</p>

            <h2>Making s-wave superconductors topological with magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniil S. Antonenko, Liang Fu, Leonid. I Glazman</p>
            <p>We show that a two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor may become topological in the presence of a magnetic field that leads to the formation of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. Below the upper critical field, a superconducting state with a nontrivial even topological number emerges, which we call the Abrikosov-Chern superconducting state. Deeper in the superconducting domain, the topological number changes in steps, always remaining even and thus not supporting Majorana states, and eventually reaches zero. Our theory uncovers the nature of evolution from an integer quantum Hall state having a cyclotron gap above the upper critical field to the topologically trivial $s$-wave superconductor carrying finite-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon levels at low field. Topological transitions manifest as changes in the number of edge modes, detectable through tunneling spectroscopy and thermal or spin transport measurements.</p>

            <p>Chemotaxis allows single cells to self-organize at the population level, as classically described by Keller-Segel models. We show that chemotactic aggregation can be understood using a generalized Maxwell construction based on the balance of density fluxes and reactive turnover.

Together, both stable and spatiotemporally dynamic aggregates emerge. Our theory mechanistically links chemotactic self-organization to phase separation and reaction-diffusion patterns.</p>

            <h2>Coarsening dynamics of chemotactic aggregates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrik Weyer, David Muramatsu, Erwin Frey</p>
            <p>Auto-chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients in chemicals they secrete, is central to the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems. Since the introduction of the Keller--Segel model, numerous variants have been analyzed, revealing phenomena such as coarsening of aggregates, stable aggregate sizes, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics. Here, we consider general mass-conserving Keller--Segel models, that is, models without cell growth and death, and analyze the generic long-time dynamics of the chemotactic aggregates. Building on and extending our previous work, which demonstrated that chemotactic aggregation can be understood through a generalized Maxwell construction balancing density fluxes and reactive turnover, we use singular perturbation theory to derive the rates of mass competition between well-separated aggregates. We analyze how this mass-competition process drives coarsening in both diffusion- and reaction-limited regimes, with the diffusion-limited rate aligning with our previous quasi-steady-state analyses. Our results generalize earlier mathematical findings, demonstrating that coarsening is driven by self-amplifying mass transport and aggregate coalescence. Additionally, we provide a linear stability analysis of the lateral instability, predicting it through a nullcline-slope criterion that parallels the curvature criterion in spinodal decomposition. Overall, our findings suggest that chemotactic aggregates behave similarly to phase-separating droplets, providing a robust framework for understanding the coarse-grained dynamics of auto-chemotactic cell populations and a quantitative basis for comparing chemotactic coarsening to canonical non-equilibrium phase separation.</p>

            <p>Convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) is a well-established probe for spatial symmetries of crystalline samples, mainly exploiting the well-defined mapping between the diffraction groups (symmetry group of CBED patterns) and the point-group symmetries of the crystalline sample. In this work, we extend CBED to determine magnetic point groups. We construct all magnetic CBED groups, of which there exist 125. Then, we provide the complete mapping of the 122 magnetic point groups to corresponding magnetic CBED groups for all crystal orientations. In order to verify the group-theoretical considerations, we conduct electron-scattering simulations on antiferromagnetic crystals and provide guidelines for the experimental realization. Based on its feasibility using existing technology, as well as on its accuracy, high spatial resolution, and small required sample size, magnetic CBED promises to be become a valuable alternative method for magnetic structure determination.</p>

            <p>We study a one-dimensional chain of identical atoms with two electronic orbitals and two electrons per atom, subject to an external oscillating pressure that periodically modulates the lattice spacing. This leads to time-dependent intra- and inter-orbital hopping amplitudes. In the tight-binding limit with weak inter-orbital hopping, the system exhibits two electronic bands separated by an oscillating indirect band-gap. By tuning hopping amplitudes and orbital energies, a periodic metal-insulator transition emerges in the half-filled system. When the frequency of this transition matches that of an external alternating electric field, the system undergoes half-wave rectification: it behaves as a conductor during one half-cycle and as an insulator during the other. This dynamic switching enables directional current flow and remains robust under small to intermediate onsite electron-electron interactions.</p>

The Ru moments order at 95 K into a $\Gamma_5$ easy-plane antiferromagnetic state. At 1.55 K the Ho moments order into an unusual $\Gamma_9$ ferromagnetic state with extensive ground state entropy and structured spin dynamics. It is shown how the internal fields with $\Gamma_5$ and $\Gamma_9$ geometry allow for two symmetry breaking transitions. The lower temperature ordering is driven by ruthenium mediated interactions between holmium moments as spin ice correlations develop. The unsaturated order is compatible with a fragmented ferromagnetic state equivalent to pyrochlore kagome ice.</p>

            <p>Quantitative description of finite-temperature properties of displacive ferroelectrics, and in particular the critical behavior, is of fundamental importance to both theory and device design, going beyond the Landau-Ginzburg approach, which requires known knowledge of critical behaviors and temperature-dependent parameter fitting. Here within quantum statistic description of quasiparticles, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition framework, by treating the bosonic condensation of the unstable phonons and the emerging collective vectorial polar mode. It enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions of various displacive ferroelectrics. Its applications to the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$, quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$, and recently fabricated ferroelectric strained SrTiO$_3$, demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases, including the critical behaviors of phase transitions. The framework offers a tractable and parameter-free quantitative basis for understanding and predicting phase transitions in a broad range of ferroelectric systems under diverse thermodynamic and external conditions, bridging microscopic modeling and device-level design.</p>

            <h2>Unsupervised Classification of Non-Hermitian Topological Phases under Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Long, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</p>
            <p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into fundamental science has opened new possibilities to address long-standing scientific challenges rooted in mathematical limitations. For example, topological invariants are used to characterize topology, but there is no universally applicable one. This limitation explains why, in the past decades-long classification of topological phases of matter -- mainly focused on Hermitian systems -- many phases initially classified ``trivial" were later identified as topological. Recently, the discovery of non-Hermitian band topology has spurred substantial efforts in non-Hermitian topological classification, including the development of new topological invariants. However, such classifications similarly risk overlooking key topological features. Here, without relying on any topological invariant, we develop an AI-based unsupervised classification of symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases. This algorithm distinguishes topological differences among non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with symmetries, and constructs, in an unsupervised manner, a topological periodic table for non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, it can account for the boundary effects, enabling the exploration of open-boundary effects on the topological phase diagram. These results introduce an unsupervised approach for classifying symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases without omission and provide valuable guidance for the development of theories and experiments.</p>

            <p>Avalanche-like plastic bursts in crystalline materials follow power law statistics, but the scaling exponents and cutoff parameters vary widely in the literature ($\alpha$ ranging from -1 to -2.2), hindering predictive modeling. Since distributions do not follow Gaussian behavior, the average of plastic kinetics is not correctly defined. Larger-scale models that rely on average behavior are therefore fundamentally flawed. We performed extensive 3D Dislocation Dynamics simulations of FCC Cu deformation across three orders of magnitude in dislocation density ($\rho = 5 \ 10^{10} \ \text{à} \ 2 \ 10^{12} \ \text{m}^{-2}$) under constant strain rates. Our results demonstrate that the power law exponent ($\alpha \approx $ -1.6 to -1.7 ) is invariant to both dislocation density and loading direction, resolving previous inconsistencies. However, dislocation density strongly controls the power law truncation scaling ($\Delta \gamma_{max} \propto \ b/\sqrt{\rho}$) and the distribution of avalanche triggering stresses. We quantify correlations between slip system activities and show how individual system contributions evolve with avalanche size. These findings reconcile experimental scatter in avalanche statistics and provide quantitative scaling laws for mesoscale-to-continuum plasticity models.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the emergence of an intrinsic space-time crystalline order in a long ferromagnetic $\varphi_{0}$ Josephson junction on a topological insulator without any external periodic modulation. The presence of the exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a ferromagnetic layer with broken inversion symmetry internally modulates the critical current due to the coupling between the magnetic moment and the Josephson phase. This breaks the time translation symmetry, leading to the appearance of the space-time crystalline pattern in the spatiotemporal dependence of the in-plane current, which oscillates with almost twice the ferromagnetic resonance frequency. In the limit where the critical current is not modulated internally, the space-time crystalline order does not occur. In this case, only when an external parametric modulation is applied, the system exhibits a typical classical discrete space-time crystalline order that oscillates at half of the modulation frequency. Considering the still-pending problem of experimental detection, we demonstrate that a recently developed magnetometry device, which visualizes the supercurrent flow at the nanoscale, can be used to detect space-time crystalline patterns in hybrid Josephson junctions experimentally.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study scanning gate microscopy of a superconductor-proximitized semiconducting wire focusing on the potential for detection of Majorana bound states. We exploit the possibility to create a local potential perturbation by the scanning gate tip which allows controllable modification of the spatial distribution of the Majorana modes, which is translated into changes in their energy structure. When the tip scans across the system, it effectively divides the wire into two parts with controllable lengths, in which two pairs of Majorana states are created when the system is in the topological regime. For strong values of the tip potential, the pairs are decoupled, and the presence of Majorana states can be detected via local tunneling spectroscopy that resolves the energy splittings resulting from the Majorana states wave functions overlap. Importantly, as the system is probed spatially via the tip, this technique can distinguish Majorana bound states from quasi-Majorana states localized on smooth potential barriers. We demonstrate that for weaker tip potentials, the two neighboring Majorana states hybridize, opening pronounced anticrossings in the energy spectra which are reflected in local conductance maps and which result in non-zero non-local conductance features. Finally, we demonstrate that the scanning gate microscopy technique can be used to discriminate between the trivial and topological nature of the zero-bias conductance peak in disordered wires.</p>

            <p>The molecular-to-atomic liquid-liquid transition (LLT) in high-pressure hydrogen is a fundamental topic touching domains from planetary science to materials modeling. Yet, the nature of the LLT is still under debate. To resolve it, numerical simulations must cover length and time scales spanning several orders of magnitude. We overcome these size and time limitations by constructing a fast and accurate machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) built on the MACE neural network architecture. The MLIP is trained on Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) density functional calculations and uses a modified loss function correcting for an energy bias in the molecular phase. Classical and path-integral molecular dynamics driven by this MLIP show that the LLT is always supercritical above the melting temperature. The position of the corresponding Widom line agrees with previous ab initio PBE calculations, which in contrast predicted a first-order LLT. According to our calculations, the crossover line becomes a first-order transition only inside the molecular crystal region. These results call for a reconsideration of the LLT picture previously drawn.</p>

            <p>The discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_{c,\text{onset}} > 40$ K in {\LNO} (LNO) thin films grown on the SrLaAlO$_4$ (SLAO) substrate with compressive ($\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) epitaxial strain provides a unique platform for investigating the superconducting mechanisms in nickelate superconductors. Here, we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to unveil the dispersive spin excitations in the LNO/SLAO superconducting thin film and establish the strain dependence of the electronic and spin excitations in LNO thin films with strain ranging from $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$ to $+1.9\%$. Compared with the bulk crystal, the LNO/SLAO thin film (with $\varepsilon\approx-2\%$) exhibits similar $dd$ excitations and spin dynamics with larger bandwidth. By contrast, tensile-strained LNO/SrTiO$_3$ ($\varepsilon \approx +1.9\%$) exhibits a marked suppression of both the spin excitations and the Ni 3{\dz}-derived $dd$ excitations. The strain dependence of the spin excitations reflects significant changes in the interlayer exchange coupling $J_z$, and the diminishing $dd$ excitations in tensile-strained samples indicate weaker Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. This strain evolution of the spin excitations and $J_z$ is attributed to the strain-tuned $c$-axis Ni-O-Ni bond angle $\varphi$, which controls the Ni 3{\dz}-O 2$p_{z}$ hybridization. Since superconductivity is observed only in films grown on SLAO, and spin correlations are enhanced along with the emergence of superconductivity, our results identify $\varphi$ as a key structural lever controlling $J_z$ and provide direct spectroscopic support for interlayer spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenarios in bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p>The question of whether interactions can break dynamical localization in quantum kicked rotor systems has been the subject of a long--standing debate. Here, we introduce an extended mapping from the kicked Lieb--Liniger model to a high--dimensional lattice model and reveal universal features: on--site pseudorandomness and hybrid exponential--algebraic decay couplings with increasing momenta. We find that the exponent and the amplitude of the algebraic decay undergo a crossover as the interaction strength increases. This mapping predicts the existence of dynamical localization and its breakdown at large kick strengths and intermediate interaction strengths. An analysis of the generalized fractal dimension and level--spacing ratio supports these findings, highlighting the presence of near integrability and multifractality in different regions of parameter space. Our results offer an explanation for the occurrence of many--body dynamical localization, particularly in strongly correlated quantum gases, and are anticipated to generalize to systems of many particles.</p>

            <p>We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Multitemperature Free Energy Sampling of Classical Ising Spin States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Tuo, Zezhu Zeng, Jiale Chen, Bingqing Cheng</p>
            <p>Generative models have advanced significantly in sampling material systems with continuous variables, such as atomistic structures. However, their application to discrete variables, like atom types or spin states, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a discrete flow matching model, tailored for systems with discrete phase-space coordinates (e.g., the Ising model or a multicomponent system on a lattice). This approach enables a single model to sample free energy surfaces over a wide temperature range with minimal training overhead, and the model generation is scalable to larger lattice sizes than those in the training set. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Ising model, showing efficient and reliable free energy sampling. These results highlight the potential of flow matching for low-cost, scalable free energy sampling in discrete systems and suggest promising extensions to alchemical degrees of freedom in crystalline materials.

            <h2>The Role of Hydrogen and Oxygen Interstitial Defects in Crystalline Si cells: Mechanism of Device Degradation in Humid Environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Li, Feifei Zhang, Yu Pang, Jinyu Hu, Huiyan Zhao, Guocai Liu, Chao He, Xingtao An</p>
            <p>The efficiency of silicon solar cells gradually decreases in various environments, with humidity being a key factor contributing to this decline through moisture-induced degradation (MID) involving multiple mechanisms including encapsulant hydrolysis and metal ion migration. Among these mechanisms, the role of water-derived hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects represents an underexplored yet fundamental degradation pathway. This study employs density functional theory and quantum transport theory to investigate hydrogen and oxygen interstitial defects as a novel perspective for understanding MID mechanisms. Results reveal that neutral hydrogen interstitials at bond-center sites exhibit low diffusion barriers (0.96 eV) and act as deep-level recombination centers, while oxygen interstitials face higher diffusion barriers (2.2 eV) with limited trapping capability. Device simulations demonstrate that hydrogen defects cause substantially more pronounced photovoltaic current degradation through enhanced non-radiative recombination. Critically, under humid conditions, hydrogen from water molecules readily penetrates silicon lattices forming active recombination centers, while oxygen incorporation remains kinetically limited with negligible impact. This interstitial defect perspective provides novel understanding of MID mechanisms, explaining why moisture exposure primarily degrades silicon solar cells through hydrogen rather than oxygen incorporation, offering fundamental insights for developing targeted mitigation strategies.</p>

            <h2>Towards Markov-State Holography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xizhu Zhao, Dmitrii E. Makarov, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Experiments, in particular on biological systems, typically probe lower-dimensional observables which are projections of high-dimensional dynamics. In order to infer consistent models capturing the relevant dynamics of the system, it is important to detect and account for the memory in the dynamics. We develop a method to infer the presence of hidden states and transition pathways based on observable transition probabilities conditioned on history sequences of visited states for projected (i.e. observed) dynamics of Markov processes. Histograms conditioned on histories reveal information on the transition probabilities of hidden paths locally between any specific pair of observed states. The convergence rate of these histograms towards a stationary distribution provides a local quantification of the duration of memory, which reflects how distinct microscopic paths projecting onto the same observed transition decorrelate in path space. This motivates the notion of "weak Markov order" and provides insight about the hidden topology of microscopic paths in a holography-like fashion. The method can be used to test for the local Markov property of observables. The information extracted is also helpful in inferring relevant hidden transitions which are not captured by a Markov-state model.</p>

            <h2>Content-Addressable Memory with a Content-Free Energy Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Félix Benoist, Luca Peliti, Pablo Sartori</p>
            <p>Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. We extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension its usefulness is limited: although it remains accurate at moderate times, it eventually experiences an abrupt breakdown and subsequently yields results that deviate strongly from the true dynamics. In contrast, in two and three dimensions the method proves far more effective, providing a reasonably accurate description of the evolution across all time scales -- from the initial transient regime to thermalization.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics and fragmentation of bosons in an optical lattice inside a cavity using Wannier and position bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Gerard R. Sevilla, Jayson G. Cosme</p>
            <p>The atom-cavity system is a versatile platform for emulating light-matter systems and realizing dissipation-induced phases, such as limit cycles (LCs) and time crystals. Here, we study the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside an optical cavity with transverse pumping and an additional intracavity optical lattice along the cavity axis. Specifically, we explore the theoretical predictions obtained from expanding the atomic field operators of the second-quantized Hamiltonian in two ways: (i) position basis and (ii) single-band Wannier basis. Both bases agree on the existence of most types of static and dynamical phases. However, the large sea of irregular dynamical phase, captured within the position basis, is absent in the Wannier basis. Moreover, we show that they predict different types of LCs due to the inherent limitation of the single-band Wannier expansion, highlighting the importance of including higher energy bands to correctly capture certain phenomena. Using truncated Wigner approximation, we investigate the fragmentation dynamics of the BEC. We demonstrate that both position and Wannier bases qualitatively agree on the photon-mediated fragmentation dynamics of the BEC in the density-wave phase, despite the absence of interatomic interactions. The presence of interatomic interaction leads to further fragmentation, which can only be observed in larger system sizes. Finally, we predict a sudden increase in the fragmentation behavior for larger pump intensities.</p>

            <p>Nanoscale conductors are interesting for thermoelectrics because of their particular spectral features connecting separated heat and particle currents. Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions. This way one can define quantum thermocouples which convert an injected heat current into useful power in an isothermal conductor, or work as refrigerators. Additionally, efficient heat management devices can be defined. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the research of multiterminal thermal and thermoelectric quantum transport leading to proposals of autonomous quantum heat engines and thermal devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Wang, Zhangyu Yang, Xingyao Wu, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</p>

            <p>Systems exhibiting the Hilbert-space fragmentation are nonergodic, and their Hamiltonians decompose into exponentially many blocks in the computational basis. In many cases, these blocks can be labeled by eigenvalues of statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOM), which play a similar role in fragmented systems as local integrals of motion in integrable systems. While a nonzero perturbation eliminates all nontrivial conserved quantities from integrable models, we demonstrate for the $t$-$J_z$ chain that an appropriately chosen perturbation may gradually eliminate SLIOMs (one by one) by progressively merging the fragmented subspaces. This gradual recovery of ergodicity manifests as an extended critical regime characterized by multiple peaks of the fidelity susceptibility. Each peak signals a change in the number of SLIOMs and blocks, as well as an ultra-slow relaxation of local observables.</p>

            <h2>Ordered buckling structures in a twisted crimped tube</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pan Dong, Nathan C. Keim, Joseph D. Paulsen</p>
            <p>When a ribbon or tube is twisted far enough it forms buckles and wrinkles. Its new geometry can be strikingly ordered, or hopelessly disordered. Here we study this process in a tube with hybrid boundary conditions: one end a cylinder, and the other end crimped flat like a ribbon, so that the sample resembles a toothpaste tube. The resulting irregular structures and mechanical responses can be dramatically different from those of a ribbon. However, when we form two creases in the tube prior to twisting, we obtain an ordered structure composed of repeating triangular facets oriented at varying angles, and a more elastic torque response, reminiscent of the creased helicoid structure of a twisted ribbon. We measure how the torque and structural evolution depend on parameters such as material thickness and the twist angle. When only part of the tube is pre-creased, the ordered structures are confined to this segment. Surprisingly, in some tubes made from thicker sheets, an ordered structure forms without pre-creasing. This study provides insights into controlling the buckling of thin shells, offering a potential pathway for designing ordered structures in soft materials.</p>

            <p>Electronic conductivity in organic materials is well-established. Both semiconductive and metallic behavior is observed in (quasi) 0-, 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional carbon-based materials and is applied in a wide range of commercial devices. Despite their large structural variety, these materials commonly have an extended {\pi}-system, formed by a double-digit number of conjugated sp2-hybridized carbon atoms, which is responsible for the conductivity. Here, we present a class of organic molecular materials that, despite the absence of an extended {\pi}-system, show a distinct direct current conductivity in quasi-1D supramolecular stacks of small organic molecules. Long-range conductivity takes place by removal of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital, i.e. oxidation, followed by charge transfer between neighboring molecules. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) on thin-film devices shows that the resulting transport band only becomes energetically accessible for charge injection from the contacts thanks to interfacial dipoles that shift the relevant molecular orbital levels by up to 2 eV. Long-range order in the form of fibrillar supramolecular polymers with lengths exceeding several micrometers enhances the macroscopic conductivity but is not essential. While current densities are moderate, this work provides a compelling explanation for the existing body of knowledge on non-{\pi}-conjugated conductivity and suggests a new way to endow organic materials with conductivity.</p>

            <p>Coherent phonons describe the collective, ultrafast motion of atoms and play a central role in light-induced structural dynamics. Here, we employ terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) to excite and detect coherent phonons in semiconducting 2H-$MoTe_{2}$ and resolve how their excitation is influenced by atomic-scale defects. In a THz pump-probe scheme, we observe long-lived oscillatory signals that we assign to out-of-plane breathing and in-plane shear modes, which are both forbidden in the bulk. Remarkably, the relative excitation strength of these modes varies near defects, indicating that local band bending modulates the coupling to the THz field. This defect-tunable coupling offers new opportunities to control material properties via selective excitation of vibrational modes at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karyn Le Hur, Fan Yang, Magali Korolev</p>
            <p>The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range N\' eel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant and of Majorana zero modes. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method "the bipartite fluctuations". Physical properties of this 1D model are in fact robust when including additional interactions, which is optimistic for practical applications e.g. in quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Canonical Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnaldo Spalvieri</p>
            <p>The paper demonstrates that the canonical probability distribution of the occupancy numbers of a bosonic system is multinomial, and shows how the thermodynamics of the canonical system descends from this distribution. The categorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle probability distribution of occupancy of the quantum eigenstates allowed to a particle of the system) of the multinomial distribution should be derived from constrained maximization of the Shannon entropy of the multinomial distribution. However, since the multinomial distribution intractable, one must renounce to a closed-form solution to the constrained maximization problem. The analysis is then focused on the thermal state, that is characterized by the constraint on system's expected energy. In this case, the paper proposes to consider a suboptimal tractable categorical distribution, which is likely to be close to the actual categorical maximizer, and shows that the one-particle Boltzmann distribution is a good approximation to the actual categorical maximizer only in certain cases, including the classical regime. The unexpected result is that, in the general case, the approximation that we find to the categorical maximizer is not of exponential type, or, in other words, is not the one-particle Boltzmann distribution. As a consequence, the probability distribution of microstates is not of exponential type. As in the standard analysis, it is always equal to the product of factors but, in the general case, these factors are not the Boltzmann factors, therefore the probability of a microstate can be different from the probability of another microstate even when the two have the same energy.</p>

Here, we overcome barriers that limit the use of ECCI including optimizing signal-to-noise contrast, precise determination of the incident beam vector with calibrated and easy to use simulations and experimental selected area electron channeling patterns (SA-ECP). We introduce a systematic ECCI workflow, alongside a new open-source software tool (AstroECP), that includes calibration of stage tilting, SA-ECP field of view, and the energy that forms the ECP/ECCI contrast using dynamical simulations. The functionality of this workflow is demonstrated with case studies that include threading dislocations in GaAs and the cross validation of precession based ECCI-contrast, which is otherwise known as Electron Channeling Orientation Determination (eCHORD). To assist the reader, we also provide best practice guidelines for ECCI implementation to promote high-resolution defect imaging in the SEM.</p>

            <p>Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning, enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16 encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.</p>

The emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method. Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS dualism is universal.</p>

            <p>Strange metals are highly entangled gapless states of matter that exhibit anomalous transport, such as linear in temperature resistivity, over more than a decade of temperature. Why a single power law should be so robust is an open question. We propose a scenario in which interactions enhance the domain of certain scattering regimes, effectively suppressing other ``would-be regimes." We test this proposal in a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid coupled to a one-dimensional acoustic phonon. We use the memory matrix formalism to calculate the dc electrical and thermal conductivities at low and high temperatures, relative to the Debye cutoff on phonon frequencies, in both the ``clean" (umklapp scattering) and ``dirty" (disorder scattering) limits. We find the crossover temperature separating the low and high temperature regimes to be interaction-dependent, with repulsive interactions substantially increasing it, generally by more than an order of magnitude. This provides a concrete illustration for how interactions can extend a single transport regime over a wider temperature range.</p>

            <p>Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization (GS) in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau (SL) oscillators, an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. Besides the SL, we considered a generalization of regular oscillators to higher dimensions and also the Lorenz model as a prototype of chaotic oscillators. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for GS to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to have global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</p>

This effect is of considerable interest for the efficient integration of antiferromagnetic materials into the fields of superconducting spintronics and electronics. A key element of this proximity effect is the Neel triplet correlations, initially predicted for S/AF heterostructures with checkerboard G-type antiferromagnetic ordering. However, various forms of antiferromagnetic ordering exist, and an important open question concerns the generalization of these results to such cases. In this paper, we develop a theory of the proximity effect in S/AF heterostructures with arbitrary two-sublattice antiferromagnetic ordering, aiming to clarify which antiferromagnets are capable of inducing triplet correlations and what structure these correlations may exhibit. We show that, in S/AF heterostructures with collinear compensated antiferromagnets, the dominant superconducting triplet correlations are of the checkerboard Neel type, as originally predicted for G-type antiferromagnets. In contrast, layered Neel triplet correlations, although potentially generated by layered antiferromagnets, are significantly weaker. Consequently, in S/AF heterostructures with layered antiferromagnetic ordering, the proximity-induced triplet correlations may exhibit either a checkerboard Neel or a conventional ferromagnetic structure, depending on the specific antiferromagnet and its orientation relative to the S/AF interface.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic physical properties of flexible van der Waals semiconductor InSe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Svane, Kim-Khuong Huynh, Yong P. Chen, Bo Brummerstedt Iversen</p>
            <p>InSe is a van der Waals semiconductor in which mechanical flexibility, high electronic mobility, and non-trivial electronic structures converge, making it an attractive platform for both intriguing fundamental studies and promising device developments. However, the nucleation and growth of phase-pure, intrinsic InSe crystals require stringent thermodynamical conditions, and have therefore remained elusive. Since InSe melts incongruently, the widely used synthesis methods based on cooling of a 1:1 In-Se mixture will produce either aggregates of multiphase crystallites or uncontrolled In-rich, heavily electron-doped InSe. This fundamental thermodynamic constraint provides a compelling explanation for the large discrepancies observed in the reported physical properties of InSe. We overcome these limitations by utilizing the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method to produce high quality, centimeter-size InSe single crystals. Electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric transport measurements demonstrate that TSFZ-InSe single crystals closely approach the intrinsic limit, establishing it as a benchmark material for the future studies of this important material.</p>

            <h2>Optimization of Ab-Initio Based Tight-Binding Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrik Dick, Thomas Dahm</p>
            <p>The electronic structure of solids can routinely be calculated by standard methods like density functional theory. However, in complicated situations like interfaces, grain boundaries or contact geometries one needs to resort to more simplified models of the electronic structure. Tight-binding models are using a reduced set of orbitals and aim to approximate the electronic structure by short range hopping processes. For example, maximally localized Wannier functions are often used for that purpose. However, their accuracy is limited by the need to disentangle the electronic bands. Here, we develop and investigate a different procedure to obtain tight-binding models inspired by machine-learning techniques. The model parameters are optimized in such a way as to reproduce ab-initio band structure data as accurately as possible using an as small as possible number of model parameters. The procedure is shown to result in models with smaller ranges and fewer orbitals than maximally localized Wannier functions but same or even better accuracy. We argue that such a procedure is more useful for automated construction of tight-binding models particularly for large-scale materials calculations.</p>

            <h2>A Class of Exclusion Processes Capable of Exhibiting Current Reversal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ngo Phuoc Nguyen Ngoc, Lam Thi Nhung</p>
            <p>A century after Ising introduced the Ising measure to study equilibrium systems, its relevance has expanded well beyond equilibrium contexts, notably appearing in non-equilibrium frameworks such as the Katz--Lebowitz--Spohn (KLS) model. In this work, we investigate a class of generalized asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEP) for which the Ising measure serves as the stationary state. We show that the average stationary current in these models can display current reversal and other unconventional behaviors, offering new insights into transport phenomena in non-equilibrium systems. Moreover, although long-range interaction rates often give rise to long-range interactions in the potential function, our model provides a counterexample: even with long-range interactions in the dynamics, the resulting potential remains short-ranged. Finally, our framework encompasses several well-known models as special cases, including ASEP, the KLS model, the facilitated exclusion process, the cooperative exclusion process, and the assisted exchange model.</p>

            <h2>A route to fully-compensated ferrimagnetic metal: electric-field annihilation of the bilayer bandgap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> San-Dong Guo, Rongyuan Bian, Feng-Ren Fan, Alessandro Stroppa</p>
            <p>Fully-compensated ferrimagnet has garnered widespread attention due to its zero-net total magnetic moment and non-relativistic global spin splitting. In general, for a fully-compensated ferrimagnet, at least one spin channel should be gapped to ensure a zero-net total magnetic moment, which would lead to a fully-compensated ferrimagnetic (FC-FIM) semiconductor or half-metal, and appears to limit the existence of an FC-FIM metal. Here we propose that an FC-FIM metal can be achieved by electrically closing the gap of a bilayer system. Using two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor as building block, we examine both FM and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer couplings and distinguish unipolar magnetic semiconductor (UMS) and bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS) monolayers. It is concluded that an electric field can annihilate the bilayer gap and realize the FC-FIM metal only when the interlayer coupling is AFM and the building block is a UMS. Our scheme for realizing an FC-FIM metal can be generalized to electrically tuned 2D spin-degenerate metal with spin-layer locking. Using first-principles calculations, we have validated our proposal by taking bilayer MnOF, bilayer $\mathrm{ScI_2}$ and monolayer $\mathrm{Hf_2S}$ as examples. Our work offers an alternative route to realize the originally forbidden FC-FIM metal, paving the way for further exploration of FC-FIM metal.</p>

            <h2>Spin-chirality-dependent modulation of topological gap, Chern number, and valley-polarization in monolayer kagome lattice Cr3Se4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenzhe Zhou, Guibo Zheng, Yating Li, Aolin Li, Fangping Ouyang</p>
            <p>Kagome materials exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The control of Chern numbers is critical for quantum device manipulation, but existing research has mainly focused on collinear magnetization while neglecting chiral spin textures. Through first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling of monolayer Cr3Se4, this study reveals spin-chirality-dependent control of topological gaps, Chern numbers, and valley polarization in kagome materials. The results demonstrate that the azimuthal angle has no observable effect. For collinear magnetization (\k{appa} = 0) or spin-chirality \k{appa} = -1, the topological bandgap decreases as the spin orientation approaches the in-plane direction. Conversely, increasing the polar angle enhances the bandgap for \k{appa} = 1. In the breathing kagome lattice, the degeneracy between K and K' valleys is lifted. As the gap undergoes sequential closure and reopening in the two valleys, the structural asymmetry and spin-chirality allow for controlled tuning of the topological gap, Chern number, and valley polarization. Moreover, the emergence of a topological Hall effect is is also demonstrated. These findings provide strategies for controlling topological states and advancing applications in quantum devices and valleytronic systems.</p>

            <h2>Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions Controlled by Tunable Metastability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renjie Zhao, Yiquan Zhang, Chenglin Luo, Yihang Wang</p>
            <p>The effects of thermal fluctuations on the morphology of two-dimensional materials are hard to harness. We propose that a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon (GNR) can exhibit thermally activated snap-through transitions with a predictable and controllable transition rate constant. The energetics and kinetics of such transitions can be fully captured by combining enhanced sampling methods and generalized transition state theory. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we determine the free energy landscape and a pair of asymmetric transition pathways of the GNR system. Notably, generalized transition state theory accurately captures how the transition rate constant responds to temperature and the tunable free energy landscape of our system. This work offers a theoretical framework for elastic metastability, introduces rare event methods into thermalized nanomechanical systems, and provides potential applications in designing nanoscale thermal switches and thermal actuators.</p>

            <h2>Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Bauch, F. Lombardi, G. Seibold</p>
            <p>Enhancing superconductivity through material design is a central goal in quantum materials research. Moire engineering, where twisting stacked layers creates long-wavelength modulations and flat bands, has shown how electronic correlations can be amplified and eventually used to raise the superconducting critical temperature Tc. Yet this approach is largely confined to van der Waals materials and offers limited tunability. Here we explore a moire-inspired alternative: imposing artificial superpotentials on otherwise homogeneous systems to engineer flat electronic minibands. Whether such superlattice potentials can truly enhance superconductivity and sustain a finite superfluid stiffness remains, however, an open question. Our calculations show that a periodic superpotential imposed to a 2D system can indeed enhance superconductivity by reconstructing the electronic bands and creating regions of large density of states, leading to a substantial increase of Tc. In contrast to conventional flat band systems, where the superfluid stiffness arises solely from quantum geometry through the quantum metric, a modulated system inherits kinetic energy from the filled minibands below the Fermi level. This inherited component coexists with a positive quantum geometric contribution, yielding a finite and robust stiffness even when the upper band becomes nearly flat. The resulting superconducting state remains coherent and resilient against weak to moderate disorder. Our findings demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a tunable route to enhance superconductivity beyond twist based moire systems, unifying flat band amplification of pairing with preserved phase stiffness. They further highlight the central role of quantum geometry in shaping collective electronic phenomena and point to superlattice design as a promising platform for next-generation superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Parameter degeneracy in the vertex model for tissues</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paulo C. Godolphim, Leonardo G. Brunnet, Rodrigo Soto</p>
            <p>The vertex model with homogeneous cell properties is known to exhibit a parameter degeneracy in which the system's dynamics is independent of the target area. Here, we show, for the heterogeneous vertex model where cells differ in size and stiffness, that degeneracy is also present with the average product of target areas and stiffness becoming dynamically irrelevant. Fixing this quantity is equivalent to fixing the global internal tissue pressure. Unless properly treated, this degeneracy undermines the physical relevance of key observables' numerical values, such as cell target shape index, cell pressure, and cell stress tensor. We present methods to resolve the degeneracy and to correctly set the gauge pressure via symmetry transformations applied to the cells' target areas. We further demonstrate that the degeneracy is removed under certain boundary conditions and partially lifted when spherical tissues are modeled using a locally planar approximation, leading to numerical consequences when fitting model parameters to experimental data. The approach extends beyond vertex models and provides a framework for testing whether the parameter spaces of other physical models are free from degeneracy.</p>

            <p>Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature. Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the spin-wave control fields -selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy axes orthogonal to the film magnetization- and by using color centers in diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin S. Kolegov, Viktor M. Fliagin, Natalia A. Ivanova</p>
            <p>Evaporative lithography in cells of arbitrary configuration allows for the creation of diverse particle deposition patterns due to the formation of a specific flow structure in the liquid caused by non-uniform evaporation. The latter in turn is determined by the shape of the liquid layer surface and the wetting menisci on the cell walls. Thus, predicting the shape of the wetting menisci can serve as a tool for controlling the process of creating desired particle deposition patterns and evaporation dynamics. Here, we propose a simple and sufficiently accurate methodology for determining the shape of the liquid meniscus in cells of arbitrary geometric shape, based on a combination of mathematical modeling and a series of experimental measurement techniques. The surface profiles of the liquid meniscus in cylindrical, square, and triangular cells were determined by measuring the change in the reflection angle of a laser beam from the free liquid surface while scanning from the cell wall to its center. The height of the wetting meniscus on the inner cell wall and the minimum liquid layer thickness at the center of the cell were measured by analyzing optical images and using a contact method, respectively. 3D meniscus profiles were obtained by numerically solving the Helmholtz equation. The boundary conditions and the unknown constant in the equation were determined based on experimental data obtained for several local points or cross-sections. The simulated meniscus shapes showed satisfactory agreement with the experimental local measurements, with a maximum relative error of less than 14%.</p>

We show that $S_x < 0$ and $S_y >0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$) denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. We find that, at low temperatures the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck coefficient is examined by dividing it into components of the conduction and valence bands; we find that the electron and hole contributions compete with each other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity, which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$</p>

            <h2>Large Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Canted Antiferromagnetic Order in $d$-Electron System on Kagome Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Waquar Ahmed, Steffen Schaeffer, Pierre Lombardo, Roland Hayn, Imam Makhfudz</p>
            <p>Electrons of $d$-symmetry interacting with a localized non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin order on a kagome lattice are considered. Even in the absence of an external magnetic field, spin-orbit coupling or relativistic effects, the spin texture produces a non-trivial intrinsic Berry curvature. This opens the route for a quantum anomalous Hall effect in the $d$-system. For spin orders with an out-of-plane component, the scalar spin chirality is finite, and the integration of the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone may yield integer Hall conductivities in units of $e^2/h$. This canted configuration gives rise to the maximal possible Chern number, $C=\pm 5$ when the Fermi level is within nontrivial gap. The effect is best understood for -- but not limited to -- isotropic $d$-electron hopping and degenerate $d$-levels. In this case, analytic expressions are available and point to a topological origin for the manifestation of the maximal $C$. Numerical calculations show that these findings are robust to some anisotropy in the hopping integrals and to moderate splittings of the $d$ levels. The $C=\pm 5$ plateau can be split into Chern peaks with smaller integers by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transition between Hall plateaus of opposite $C$ can be driven by flipping the out-of-plane component of the spin order, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information.</p>

            <p>DNA origami nanostructures provide programmable control over nanoscale geometry but remain challenging to image due to their low atomic number. Here, we systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids. Using Weber contrast as a quantitative metric, we compared different operating modes of (scanning) transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, in order to find optimum imaging conditions. STEM was consistently found to deliver the highest contrast, with optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector. As expected, the contrast was higher for the thicker three-dimensional nanotubes as compared to DNA 6-helix bundles (6HBs) due to the larger projected thickness of the former. The contrast was effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate. Notably, 3D molds preserved their designated dimensions upon staining and also largely retained their structural integrity upon complexation with palladium, which also improved the visibility of the structures. These results establish STEM as the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami even of unstained samples and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging conditions that promote reliable structural visualization.</p>

We then demonstrate that this mechanism quantitatively captures the bistability phase boundary observed in the experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev.

            <p>For nanoscale single-layer graphene-based devices, valley-dependent topological physics may be exploited in device design. To demonstrate the point, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of single-layer graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is presented with respect to configurational fluctuations. Last, a proof-of-concept electron energy band-stop filter is illustrated, highlighting the potential of the foregoing confinement and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale single-layer graphene devices.</p>

In this respect, lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals represent a unique system, for which the interaction with optical phonons is particularly strong, giving rise to a ladder of multiple exciton states which can be optically excited with femtosecond pulses. We establish a new regime of coherent exciton-polaron dynamics with exceptionally long coherence times (T2 ~300 ps) in an ensemble of CsPbI3 nanocrystals embedded in a glass matrix. Using transient two-pulse photon echo at 2 K temperature, we observe quantum beats between the exciton-polaron states. Within a four-level model, we directly quantify the exciton-phonon coupling strength through the Huang-Rhys factors of 0.05-0.1 and 0.02-0.04 for low-energy optical phonons with energies of 3.2 and 5.1 meV, respectively. The pronounced size dependence of both coupling strengths and phonon lifetimes offers a path to tune the optical transitions between polaron states and to tailor the coherent optical dynamics in perovskite semiconductors for solid-state quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. We use this method to detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit coupled to the microwave-excited electrons. To elucidate the origin of the observed response, the result is compared with an independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of the many-electron system rather than the vertical displacement of the individually excited electrons, as was explicate earlier. A theoretical analysis of the expected response due to the vertical displacement is given.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Díaz, J. Rodríguez-Fernández, J. Rubio-Zuazo</p>
            <p>Magnetic anisotropy in disordered rare-earth-transition metals (RE-TM) compounds arises from RE atoms occupying asymmetric environments within the TM lattice. However, the underlying mechanism that promotes such environments remains not fully understood. In this study, we investigate amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering, where the magnetic anisotropy evolves with thickness from in-plane to out-of-plane orientation above 40 nm. X-ray reflectivity measurements revealed the progressive formation of an additional layer between the 3 nm Si capping layer and the NdCo film with increasing film thickness. To probe the composition and distribution of Co and Nd near the surface, Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (HAXPES) was performed on films ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm in thickness using incident photon energies of 7, 19, and 13 keV. These correspond to inelastic electron mean free paths of 7.2-12.3 nm in cobalt. The cobalt atomic concentration, deduced from HAXPES at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations, was consistently below the nominal value and varied with both thickness and photon energy. This indicates segregation of RE atoms at the film surface, which becomes more pronounced with increasing thickness. Background analysis of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks supports this conclusion. The thickness of the Nd segregated layer is estimated in 2-3 nm. These findings demonstrate that incorporating neodymium into the cobalt lattice incurs an energy cost which is associated with strain due to the volume mismatch between the two elements. Reducing this strain energy promotes anisotropic atomic environments for Nd, thereby explaining the emergence of perpendicular anisotropy and its dependence on film thickness in these RE-TM compounds.</p>

The model is motivated by the physics of fracton excitations, which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full model. We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of independent transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile excitations and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces between them, resulting in a non-trivial spectrum.</p>

            <h2>Resonating-valence-bond superconductor from small Fermi surface in twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>Mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) remains one of the central problems in correlated moiré materials. The most intriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair formed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point out the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets, dubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\nu=-2-x$, there is a two-component picture: two electrons mainly localize at each AA site and form a paired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon, while additional holes doped into the AA sites form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to an intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and is topologically distinct to the conventional Fermi liquid. We develop a unified framework to describe both a renormalized FL phase and an sFL phase. We propose that the TBG superconductor emerges from the sFL phase, but is close to the transition toward the FL phase under increasing hole doping. In the superconductor, pairing of local moments is shared to the mobile carriers and a smaller superconducting gap with nodal $p_x$ symmetry is opened on the small hole pockets. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified theory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap nematic superconductivity below it.</p>

            <h2>Competitive Orders in Altermagnetic Chiral Magnons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Congzhe Yan, Jinyang Ni</p>
            <p>The magnons in altermagnets exhibit chiral splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields. Typically, this chiral splitting behavior can be well described by alternating isotropic spin exchanges (ISE) near the zero temperature. However, its finite-temperature dynamics, particularly when incorporating spin-orbit coupling effects, remains elusive. In this study, we reveal that, when including magnon-magnon interactions, long-range anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) can also induce chiral splitting of magnons at a finite temperature. Crucially, the chiral splitting induced by ASE competes with that arising from ISE, leading to a pronounced temperature-dependent modulation of the altermagnetic chiral splitting. Moreover, this competition is intimately connected to spin fluctuations, and can reverse the spin current driven by the band splitting as temperature increases. Our work uncovers the intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical behavior.</p>

            <p>Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry at a non-conformal quantum critical point in one dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Flores-Calderón, M. Zündel</p>
            <p>In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $\eta \simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.</p>

            <p>Understanding how protective oxide scales evolve over time is necessary for improving the long term resistance of superalloys. This work investigates the time-dependent oxidation behavior of an ingot-processable Co/Ni-based superalloy oxidized in air at $800~^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for $20$, $100$, and $1000~\mathrm{h}$ . Mass-gain and white-light interferometry measurements quantified oxidation kinetics, surface roughness, and spallation, while high-resolution STEM-EDX characterized oxide morphology and nanoscale elemental partitioning. Atom probe tomography captured the key transition regions between the chromia and alumina scales, and X-ray diffraction was used to identify a gradual transition from NiO and (Ni,Co)-spinel phases to a compact, dual phase chromia and alumina-rich scale. The oxidation rate evolved from near-linear to parabolic behavior with time, consistent with diffusion-controlled growth once a continuous Cr$_2$O$_3$/$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ scale formed. These observations help link kinetics, structure and chemistry, showing how an originally porous spinel layer transforms into a dense, adherent chromia + alumina scale that provides long-term protection in wrought Co/Ni-based superalloys.</p>

            <p>At continuous phase transitions, quantum many-body systems exhibit scale-invariance and complex, emergent universal behavior. Most strikingly, at a quantum critical point, correlations decay as a power law, with exponents determined by a set of universal scaling dimensions. Experimentally probing such power-law correlations is extremely challenging, owing to the complex interplay between decoherence, the vanishing energy gap, and boundary effects. Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale, we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.</p>

            <h2>Quantum thermalization must occur in translation-invariant systems at high temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saúl Pilatowsky-Cameo, Soonwon Choi</p>
            <p>Quantum thermalization describes how closed quantum systems can effectively reach thermal equilibrium, resolving the apparent incongruity between the reversibility of Schrödinger's equation and the second law of thermodynamics. Despite its ubiquity and conceptual significance, the precise conditions that give rise to quantum thermalization are still not well understood. After nearly a century of efforts, we have yet to find a complete mathematical proof that an effective statistical description naturally emerges the underlying quantum dynamics in generic settings. Here, we prove that quantum thermalization must occur in any qubit system with local interactions under three conditions: (i) high effective temperature, (ii) translation invariance, and (iii) no perfect resonances in the energy spectrum. Specifically, we show that a typical, low-complexity pure state drawn from any ensemble with large entropy and well-defined effective temperature becomes locally indistinguishable from a Gibbs state upon unitary evolution. In this setting, our rigorous results prove the widely anticipated notion that statistical physics should be understood as an emergent phenomenon, explicitly derived from the first principles of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>Understanding and optimizing the relaxation dynamics of many-body systems is essential both for foundational studies in quantum thermodynamics and for applications such as quantum simulation and quantum computing. Efficient preparation of thermal states of a many-body Hamiltonian is governed by the spectral properties of the associated Lindbladian, in particular its spectral gap, which determines the slowest relaxation rate. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for constructing Lindbladians that prepare thermal states. Our approach reveals a simple relation between the relaxation dynamics at finite and infinite temperatures. The framework is scalable to larger system sizes when implemented using tensor-network methods. We find that efficient thermalization requires that the relaxation dynamics respect the symmetries of the thermal state, which reduces the number of free parameters. By applying gradient-based optimization to the Lindbladians, we enhance the spectral gap and thereby boost thermalization. When applied to both classical and quantum spin models, our method demonstrates a substantial enhancement of the spectral gap. For larger system sizes, our approach provides a variational upper bound and enables a certified lower bound on the minimum relaxation rate.</p>

            <p>We provide a universal framework for the quantum simulation of SU(N) Yang--Mills theories on fault-tolerant digital quantum computers adopting the orbifold lattice formulation. As warm-up examples, we also consider simple models, including scalar field theory and the Yang--Mills matrix model, to illustrate the universality of our formulation, which shows up in the fact that the truncated Hamiltonian can be expressed in the same simple form for any N, any dimension, and any lattice size, in stark contrast to the popular approach based on the Kogut--Susskind formulation. In all these cases, the truncated Hamiltonian can be programmed on a quantum computer using only standard tools well-established in the field of quantum computation. As a concrete application of this universal framework, we consider Hamiltonian time evolution by Suzuki--Trotter decomposition. This turns out to be a straightforward task due to the simplicity of the truncated Hamiltonian. We also provide a simple circuit structure that contains only CNOT and one-qubit gates, independent of the details of the theory investigated.</p>

            <h2>Energy injection in an epithelial cell monolayer indicated by negative viscosity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Molly McCord, Jacob Notbohm</p>
            <p>Epithelial tissues are driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by internally generated forces, causing complex patterns of motion. Even when both the forces and motion are measurable, it is not yet possible to relate the two, because the sources of energy injection and dissipation are often unclear. Here, we study how energy is transferred by developing a method to measure the effective viscosity from the shear stresses and strain rates within an epithelial cell monolayer. Interestingly, there emerged multicellular regions in which the relationship between shear stress and shear strain rate was negatively proportional, indicating a negative effective viscosity. The negative effective viscosity occurred in regions wherein cell stresses were less efficient at producing tissue deformations compared to regions of positive effective viscosity. Regions of negative effective viscosity consistently exhibited greater cell speed and vorticity, and the cells had elevated metabolic activity, reflecting an increased energy demand in these cells. Our study shows that negative effective viscosity is a useful means of quantifying the flow of energy in living matter.</p>

            <h2>Momentum coupling of classical atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Suto</p>
            <p>A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</p>

            <p>We experimentally realize a quantum clock by using a charge sensor to count charges tunneling through a double quantum dot (DQD). Individual tunneling events are used as the clock's ticks. We quantify the clock's precision while measuring the power dissipated by the DQD and, separately, the charge sensor in both direct-current and radio-frequency readout modes. This allows us to probe the thermodynamic cost of creating ticks microscopically and recording them macroscopically. Our experiment is the first to explore the interplay between the entropy produced by a microscopic clockwork and its macroscopic measurement apparatus. We show that the latter contribution not only dwarfs the former but also unlocks greatly increased precision, because the measurement record can be exploited to optimally estimate time even when the DQD is at equilibrium. Our results suggest that the entropy produced by the amplification and measurement of a clock's ticks, which has often been ignored in the literature, is the most important and fundamental thermodynamic cost of timekeeping at the quantum scale.</p>

            <p>We optimize matrix-product state-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol, which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and nonstabilizer random-structured quantum circuits, with up to 1000 qubits and 100 layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with up to hundreds of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</p>

            <p>Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Axion-mediated photon-to-photon transitions in high finesse dielectric resonators</h2>

            <p>Axions are hypothetical particles that could address both the strong charge-parity problem in quantum chromodynamics and the enigmatic nature of dark matter. However, if axions exist, their mass remains unknown, and they are expected to interact very weakly with the electromagnetic field, which explains why they have not been detected yet. This study proposes a way to substantially augment the axion-photon interaction by confining the photons within high-quality-factor dielectric resonators, increasing their intensity and lifetime, and thus the possibility of interacting with axions in the background. In view of this, we study resonant axion-mediated photonic transitions in millimeter-sized spherical dielectric resonators, based on fully analytical calculations to the first order in perturbation theory. Such resonators exhibit high lifetime Mie resonances in the microwave part of the spectrum, with a separation that can be tailored with the radius of the sphere to match the expected axion frequency, allowing axion-mediated photonic transitions when particular selection rules are fulfilled. We predict experimentally accessible axion mass regimes where such triply resonant transitions can be realized with standard dielectric resonators. We propose an experiment for probing such interactions named DARK-ROSE.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Hess, Quaid Morris</p>
            <p>This paper shows that generative diffusion processes converge to associative memory systems at vanishing noise levels and characterizes the stability, robustness, memorization, and generation dynamics of both model classes. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are shown to be universal approximators of associative memory models, with diffusion processes as their white-noise perturbations. The universal properties of associative memory that follow are used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise diminishes. Structural stability of Morse-Smale flows -- that is, the robustness of their global critical point structure -- implies the stability of both trajectories and invariant measures for diffusions in the zero-noise limit. The learning and generation landscapes of these models appear as parameterized families of gradient flows and their stochastic perturbations, and the bifurcation theory for Morse-Smale systems implies that they are generically stable except at isolated parameter values, where enumerable sets of local and global bifurcations govern transitions between stable systems in parameter space. These landscapes are thus characterized by ordered bifurcation sequences that create, destroy, or alter connections between rest points and are robust under small stochastic or deterministic perturbations. The framework is agnostic to model formulation, which we verify with examples from energy-based models, denoising diffusion models, and classical and modern Hopfield networks. We additionally derive structural stability criteria for Hopfield-type networks and find that simple cases violate them. Collectively, our geometric approach provides insight into the classification, stability, and emergence of memory and generative landscapes.</p>

Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provide a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</p>

            <h2>Chemical and Conformational Control of the Spectroscopic Properties of Multi-Layer and Multi-Defect Carbon Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arshad Mehmood, Caitlin V. Hetherington, Zain Zaidi, Benjamin G. Levine</p>
            <p>Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence (PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of complex CDs with multiple layers and multiple defects are determined by their structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing defects, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing defects, such as hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission, except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing defects. We find that not only the excitation energy but also the excitation character itself is impacted by the presence of specific defects, and the pH-dependence of the spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.</p>

            <h2>Privacy in Distributed Quantum Sensing with Gaussian Quantum Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Uesli Alushi, Roberto Di Candia</p>
            <p>We study the privacy properties of distributed quantum sensing protocols in a Gaussian quantum network, where each node encodes a parameter via a local phase shift. For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers. However, we show that optimized fully symmetric Gaussian states enable improved privacy levels while maintaining near-optimal sensing performance. We show that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision. Our results pave the way for the development of practical, private distributed quantum sensing protocols in continuous-variable quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elliott Sutton, Waldo Rosales Trujillo, Adam Kowalski, Cláudio P. Fonte, Anne Juel</p>
            <p>We develop a one-dimensional network model to predict the steady-state distribution of yield-stress fluids in branched pipe manifolds under wall-slip conditions. The model accounts for major friction losses between junctions and incorporates wall slip through a power-law relation calibrated independently via capillary rheometry. Predictions from the model are validated against both bench-scale experiments and fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, showing excellent agreement across a range of flow conditions. Our results demonstrate that wall slip strongly influences the uniformity of fluid distribution by modifying the relative resistance between outlet branches. Furthermore, we show that the problem can be inverted: measured distribution profiles can be used to estimate slip parameters, offering a practical method for slip characterisation without pressure measurement. This modelling framework is computationally inexpensive, robust, and adaptable to various network configurations, making it a valuable tool for the design and analysis of industrial manifold systems involving viscoplastic fluids.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Goswami (1), Hannes Jónsson (1) ((1) Science Institute and Faculty of Physical Sciences, University of Iceland, Reykjavík, Iceland)</p>
            <p>Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</p>

            <h2>Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hubert J. Naguszewski, Christopher D. Woodgate, David Quigley</p>
            <p>Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high-throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <p>Optomechanical sensors enable exquisitely sensitive force measurements, with emerging applications across quantum technologies, standards, fundamental science, and engineering. Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Symmetry and Geometry in Double-Scaled SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeremy van der Heijden, Erik Verlinde, Jiuci Xu</p>
            <p>The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renan da Silva Souza, Youjiang Xu, Walter Hofstetter</p>
            <p>We numerically study a gas of two-component fermions coupled to a transversely pumped optical cavity and confined to a two-dimensional static square optical lattice. In the dispersive regime, the steady state of the system is described by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian with cavity-mediated long-range interactions. Using real-space dynamical mean-field theory (RDMFT), we investigate the formation of the (superradiant) checkerboard density-wave phase both at quarter and half filling. We focus on the paramagnetic phase assuming sufficiently high temperatures such that no magnetic long-range order develops. At quarter filling, we find a reentrant homogeneous Fermi liquid to density wave phase transition with increasing temperature, which is due to the higher entropy of the ordered phase. At half filling, in addition to the Fermi liquid to Mott insulator phase transition, marked by a vanishing quasiparticle residue at the Fermi level, we identify the transition into a density-wave phase. Due to perfect Fermi surface nesting at half filling, we find that arbitrarily small long-range interactions destabilize the system towards the density-wave phase in the absence of short-range interactions. By varying short- and long-range interactions at a fixed low temperature, we obtain the full phase diagram and identify a region of coexistence between the homogeneous Fermi liquid and Mott insulating phase with the density-wave phase. In this region, we determine the thermodynamic phase transition by comparing the energies of the different RDMFT solutions.</p>

The quantum fluctuations of the surface electromagnons drive a nearby graphene monolayer into an anyonic Chern insulator, characterized by anyonic quasi-particles and a topological gap that decays polynomially with the graphene-substrate distance. Our work opens a path to controllably break time-reversal symmetry and induce exotic quantum states through cavity vacuum fluctuations.</p>

This interplay between light-engineered Higgs excitations and emergent vortex textures opens a pathway to probe nonequilibrium superconductivity with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Our results bridge quantum optics and condensed matter physics, offering new examples of quantum printing where one uses structured light to manipulate the collective modes in correlated quantum fluids.</p>

            <p>Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer promising opportunities for photonics and optoelectronics due to their narrowband emission, control over the transition dipole moment, and potential for polarized light emission. However, achieving uniform PeNPLs and effective surface passivation major challenges, especially for red-emitting iodide-based compounds. Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission. When integrated into light-emitting diodes, our PeNPL devices achieve a external quantum efficiency of 13.1%, the highest reported for strongly-confined PeNPL-based devices. Taken together, these results establish ancillary ligand-induced synthesis of uniform-monolayer PeNPLs as a decisive route to robust orientation control, positioning it as the central principle for advancing next-generation photonic and display technologies.</p>

            <p>Metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have emerged as leading candidates for next-generation quantum emitters, offering a unique combination of high photoluminescence quantum yield, tunable emission, short radiative lifetimes, and record-high single-photon purity under ambient conditions.

In this Review, we outline the physical parameters that define quantum emission in PNCs, compare their performance to other established and emerging quantum emitters, and assess the key figures of merit, including photostability, single-photon purity, and photon indistinguishability, required for practical quantum applications. We discuss underlying mechanisms affecting PNC emission behavior and highlight recent advances in improving their quantum emitting properties through synthetic and photonic engineering approaches. While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources.</p>

            <p>Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.</p>

The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</p>

However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</p>

            <p>Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences using one and two impurities, the protocol gives independent access to the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, thereby providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</p>

While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model.

            <p>Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.</p>

            <p>We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $\pi$ modes.</p>

            <h2>Electrostatic, Luminescent, and Paramagnetic Responses of Fresh BN Nanopowders Synthesized under Concentrated Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lina Sartinska</p>
            <p>This study explores the properties of nanopowders synthesized under high-temperature, non-equilibrium conditions in a high-flux optical furnace in a nitrogen flow. Boron powders served as the starting material, and the intense thermal gradients during synthesis led to incomplete chemical reactions. As a result, the surface of the resulting nanoparticles is covered with a thin layer of sassolite, followed by boron oxides, beneath which lies a boron nitride shell. The subsurface contains boron-rich nitride phases, while the core consists of elemental boron. For reference, commercial platelet-like h-BN powders from the "Chempur" company were also analyzed. Initially, all synthesized nanopowders displayed pronounced electrostatic charging, photoluminescence (PL), and paramagnetic activity, attributable to high surface defect densities and unsaturated chemical bonds. However, after two years of exposure to ambient air, these nanopowders exhibited complete loss of electrostatic charging, absence of photoluminescence (PL), and disappearance of the characteristic single EPR resonance line. Similarly, commercial h-BN nanopowder from the "Chempur" company does not exhibit a single EPR resonance line too. FTIR analysis revealed progressive surface oxidation and hydroxylation of this powder, suggesting that atmospheric moisture and oxygen effectively passivated defect states. These findings underscore the critical role of surface chemistry in governing the electrostatic, optical, and magnetic behavior of BN-based nanomaterials and highlight the importance of defect stabilization for preserving functional properties over time.</p>

            <h2>Probing Topological Stability with Nonlocal Quantum Geometric Markers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quentin Marsal, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</p>
            <p>Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Mediated interactions in mixtures of ultracold atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry Ando, Geyue Cai, Cheng Chin, Tilman Enss</p>
            <p>We describe recent theoretical and experimental developments on mediated interactions in mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms. We discuss how particle-hole excitations of a Fermi sea can induce long-range interactions between heavy impurities or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Conversely, phonon excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate induce interactions between fermionic atoms. These mediated interactions exhibit different short-range and long-range scaling regimes with distance and, if strong enough, can induce fermion superfluidity. We discuss the prospects for observing new phenomena that could arise from mediated interactions. Experimentally, we outline recent studies of the 133Cs-6Li Bose-Fermi mixture, a platform well-suited for investigating fermion-mediated interactions. A Cs Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Li Fermi gas is prepared with tunable interspecies interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, precision measurements of condensate properties reveal fermion-mediated attractions between bosons, matching theoretical predictions. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe suppression and revival of sound modes and novel many-body resonances. Altogether, we aim to highlight both instances where experiment and theory agree well, and promising prospects to engineer long-range interactions in atomic quantum gases.</p>

            <h2>Control of Extraordinary Optical Transmission in Resonant Terahertz Gratings via Lateral Depletion in an AlGaN-GaN Heterostructure</h2>

            <p>Periodic metallic gratings on substrates can support a range of electromagnetic modes, such as leaky waveguide, guided-resonant, and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity modes, which can strongly modulate optical transmission under resonant excitation. Here, we investigate how this coupling can be dynamically manipulated through charge-density control in a laterally patterned AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The structure comprises metallic stripes separated by regions containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), forming a periodically modulated interface whose electromagnetic response is governed by the charge density between the stripes. In the unbiased state, the conductive 2DEG screens the incident terahertz field and suppresses excitation of guided modes. When the 2DEG is depleted, the change in boundary conditions allows efficient coupling into substrate resonances, producing a strong modulation at particular frequencies where extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through the structure takes place. The results highlight the sensitive dependence of guided-mode-resonance (GMR) mediated EOT on inter-stripe charge distribution and demonstrate a direct interplay between carrier dynamics and resonant electromagnetic phenomena in the terahertz regime.</p>

            <p>Intense quantum fluctuations arising from geometrical frustrations in kagome-lattice magnets provide a feasible approach to exotic quantum states. Here, we document an unexpected isosymmetric first-order magnetic transition in the recently synthesized frustrated kagome-lattice antiferromagnet Nd3ScBi5, which is characterized by significant latent heat and a pronounced magnetocaloric effect, as well as discontinuous Raman shifts and negligible hysteresis. Employing the magnetocaloric effect as a detection method, in conjunction with systematical field-dependent physical properties, we uncover a distinctive 1/2 magnetization plateau phase with significant quantum fluctuations. Our study unveils Nd3ScBi5 as a prototypical model with an emerging phase of enhanced quantum fluctuations triggered by first-order magnetic transitions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the single crystals of Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$, revealing that Ni intercalation profoundly alters the physical properties of NbSe$_2$. Magnetic measurements clearly show that the system is magnetically frustrated with antiferromagnetic ordering below 23.5\,K, with an irreversibility temperature near 10\,K, and a magnetic hysteresis with a small net magnetic moment. Overall, the system can be described as an inhomogeneous antiferromagnetic phase with magnetic disorder and magnetic frustration. We found two Curie-Weiss temperatures of -80\,K for the field in the {\it ab}-plane and -137\,K for the field out of plane, which are a consequence of anisotropic interactions in spin space and favor an orientation of the spin along the {\it c}-axis. Temperature-dependent resistivity shows a complete suppression of both charge density waves and superconducting order down to 300\,mK. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 84\,K reveals a $\overline{\Gamma}$-centered electron pocket in Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$, which is absent in pristine NbSe$_2$. The electronic structure results show a shift of the van Hove singularity (VHS), which is the main cause of the suppression of the electronic orders. These results align with recent theoretical predictions that Ni intercalation with cationic disorder favors frustrated antiferromagnetic stripe states, shifts the VHS and reconstructs the Fermi surface in NbSe$_2$. Our findings position Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$ within a magnetically frustrated, non-superconducting regime, highlighting how partial intercalation and disorder drive complex magnetic order and the Fermi surface reconstruction in low-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Measurement protocol for detecting correlated topological insulators in synthetic quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixin Ma, Chao Xu, Shenghan Jiang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}\theta \hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $\theta$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) unifies the Berry curvature (its imaginary part) and the quantum metric (its real part), yet Raman studies of chiral phonons have so far accessed only the former. We perform circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on the quantum magnet K2Co(SeO3)2, where the field-odd chiral splitting and the field-even center-frequency shift collapse onto a single curve across temperature and magnetic field, revealing a common microscopic origin for both observables. Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement.</p>

            <h2>Microwave Dressed States and Vacuum Fluctuations in a Superconducting Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anoop Dhillon, A. Hamed Majedi</p>
            <p>Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.</p>

            <p>Crystalline symmetries determine the linear and nonlinear response of materials to external stimuli such as mechanical pressure and electromagnetic fields, governing phenomena such as piezoelectricity, optical activity, and multiple wave mixing with wide ranging technological applications. Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting.</p>

            <p>Ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics are the electric counterparts of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These materials undergo temperature- and electric-field-induced phase transitions that give rise to their characteristic hysteresis loops. Modeling such hysteresis loops and associated phase transitions enables both a deeper fundamental understanding and reliable property predictions for this important class of materials. To date, modeling has largely relied on classical approaches, often remaining qualitative and/or empirical. Traditional interpretation of these transitions rests on two assumptions: (i) they are activated Arrhenius-type processes and (ii) they occur well within the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate that a model can instead be built on two ''orthogonal`` assumptions: (i) the phase transitions are relaxational processes and (ii) they require a quantum mechanical treatment. Applying this model to both antiferroelectrics and ferroelectrics overcomes the limitations of traditional models and enables efficient first-principles simulations of phase transitions. Furthermore, the success of our unconventional approach highlights the significance of quantum mechanics in transitions long regarded as purely classical. We anticipate that this framework will be applicable to a broad range of phase transitions, including magnetic, elastic, multiferroic, and electronic, along with modeling of quantum tunneling, rates of chemical reactions, and others.</p>

            <p>The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.</p>

I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bahram Houchmandzadeh (LIPhy)</p>
            <p>Given an evolutionary model, such as Wright--Fisher (WF) or Moran, the n-coalescent problem consists of going backward in time to find for example the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and the topology of the tree. In the literature, this problem is tackled mostly by computing directly the random variable t, time to reach the MRCA. I show here that by shifting the focus from the random variable t to the joined variable (n,t), where n is the number of ancestors at time t, the problem is greatly simplified. Indeed, P(n,t), the probability of this variable, obeys a simpler master equation that can be solved in a straightforward way for the most general model. This probability can then be used to compute relevant information of the n-coalescent, for both random variables $t_{n}$ (random time to reach a given state n) and $n_{t}$ (random number of ancestors at a given time t). The cumulative distribution function for $t_{1}$ for example is $P(1,t)$. I give in this article the general solution for continuous time models such as Moran and discrete time ones such as WF.</p>

            <h2>Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brenden Bowen, Albert Farah, Spasen Chaykov, Nishant Agarwal</p>
            <p>Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.</p>

When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.</p>

            <p>Monolayer 2D semiconductors, such as WS2, exhibit uniquely strong light-matter interactions due to exciton resonances that enable atomically-thin optical elements. Similar to geometry-dependent plasmon and Mie resonances, these intrinsic material resonances offer coherent and tunable light scattering. Thus far, the impact of the excitons temporal dynamics on the performance of such excitonic metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide valuable insights in the role of excitonic light scattering in 2D nanophotonic devices.</p>

            <p>Spectrally selective absorbers that maximize solar absorption and minimize thermal radiation loss are crucial for efficient solar thermal energy harvesting. However, limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of conventional materials hinder the fabrication of interference-based absorbers with desired optical properties. Herein, a high-performance solar absorber with a Dallenbach-type dielectric-metal tandem structure was fabricated using an ultrathin, subquarter-wavelength thickness single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) membrane with tailored optical spectra as the absorbing layer. By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\approx 190^\circ$C ($270^\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber. This study presents a high-performance solar absorber with a simple planar structure and proposes a concept of designing dielectric with the desired optical properties by mixing various types of structure-sorted SWCNTs.</p>

            <p>Fast, volumetric imaging that integrates multiple imaging modalities is essential for probing dynamic, heterogeneous soft and biological matter. Here, we present the M3Scope, a simple yet versatile multiplane microscope that extends widefield detection with a modular multimode cube to enable dual color fluorescence, polarization-resolved, and correlative brightfield fluorescence imaging while (i) preserving simultaneous 3D acquisition at high frame rates (100 fps) and (ii) requiring minimal realignment. We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D. Taken together, these results show that the M3Scope delivers high speed volumetric imaging with flexible modality switching, providing a powerful platform for studying dynamic, heterogeneous systems across disciplines, from polymer physics to cell mechanobiology.</p>

            <p>From the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive a bulk dual of the work distribution defined by the two-point measurement on the boundary, yielding a bulk formulation of the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem. We argue that this not only provides a holographic prescription of the work distribution, but is also expected to capture some "mesoscopic" aspects of quantum gravity.</p>

            <h2>Splitting obstructions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in time-reversal symmetric topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Ferreri, Domenico Monaco, Gabriele Peluso</p>
            <p>The Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index characterizes two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric topological phases of matter. We shed some light on some features of this index by investigating projection-valued maps endowed with a fermionic time-reversal symmetry. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we establish a decomposition theorem, proving that any such projection-valued map admits a splitting into two projection-valued maps that are related to each other via time-reversal symmetry. Second, we provide a complete homotopy classification theorem for these maps, thereby clarifying their topological structure. Third, by means of the previous analysis, we connect the Fu-Kane-Mele index to the Chern number of one of the factors in the previously-mentioned decomposition, which in turn allows to exhibit how the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued topological obstruction to constructing a periodic and smooth Bloch frame for the projection-valued map, measured by the Fu-Kane-Mele index, can be concentrated in a single pseudo-periodic Kramers pair.</p>

            <h2>Parallel and GPU accelerated code for phase-field and reaction-diffusion simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven A. Silber, Mikko Karttunen</p>
            <p>We present SymPhas 2.0, a major update of the compile-time symbolic algebra simulation framework SymPhas for phase-field and reaction-diffusion models. This release introduces significant expansions and enhancements that enable the definition of a phase-field model directly from the free-energy functional via compile-time evaluated functional differentiation. It also introduces directional derivatives, symbolic summation, tensor-valued expressions, and compile-time derived finite difference stencils of arbitrary order and accuracy. Furthermore, the code has been parallelized for CPUs with MPI, and GPU computing has been added using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). For the latter, symbolic expressions are compiled into optimized CUDA kernels, allowing large-scale simulations to execute entirely on the GPU. For large systems ($32,768^2$ in 2D and $1,024^3$ in 3D with double precision), speedups up to $\sim \!\!1,000 \times$ were obtained compared to the first version of SymPhas using multi-threaded CPU execution on a single system. These developments establish SymPhas 2.0 as a flexible and scalable framework for efficient implementation of phase-field and reaction-diffusion models on GPU-based high-performance computing platforms.</p>

            <p>Ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy provides unique access to the structural dynamics of molecules, spin-valley relaxation in semiconductors, and the non-equilibrium optical response of chiral nanophotonic systems. Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (<50 ${\mu}$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation. The simplicity, sensitivity, and wide applicability of this detection scheme provide a powerful platform for broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy, opening new opportunities in biochemistry, solid-state physics, and nanophotonics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Martin-Monier, Pierre-Luc Piveteau, Fabien Sorin</p>
            <p>Soft electronics have recently gathered considerable interest thanks to their bio-mechanical compatibility. An important feature of such deformable conductors is their electrical response to strain. While development of stretchable materials with high gauge factors has attracted considerable attention, there is a growing need for stretchable conductors whose response to deformation can be accurately engineered to provide arbitrary resistance-strain relationships. The rare studies addressing this issue have focused on deterministic geometries of single rigid materials, limiting the scope of such strategies. Herein, we introduce the novel concept of periodic stretchable patterns combining multiple conductive materials to produce tailored responses. Using shortest-path algorithms, we establish a computationally efficient selection method to obtain required resistance-strain relationship. Using this algorithm, we identify and experimentally demonstrate constant resistance-strain responses up to 50% elongation using a single micro-textured material. Finally, we demonstrate counter-intuitive sinusoidal responses by integrating three materials, with interesting applications in sensing and soft robotics.</p>

            <p>The absence of odd-order Shapiro steps is a predicted signature of topological this http URL, the missing first-order Shapiro step has been reported in both putative topological superconducting systems and topologically trivial superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions. Here, we revisit this phenomenon in topologically trivial Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation. The missing first Shapiro step coincides with a sharp voltage jump during superconducting switching, yet reappears when the jump is lowered and softened by increasing microwave power, temperature, or magnetic field. It also reappears at higher microwave frequencies, consistent with qualitative results from an RSJ model incorporating the sharp jump. These observations indicate that the absence of the first Shapiro step, associated with the sharp switching jump, simply results from their location within the measurement blind region. This work identifies a common but overlooked mechanism underlying the missing first Shapiro step, offering new insights into fractional Josephson effect experiments.</p>

            <h2>Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane</p>
            <p>Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</p>

            <h2>Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiechao Feng, Daniel Evans, Ahmad K. Omar</p>
            <p>Identifying the universality class of critical active phase transitions has been the subject of recent interest and controversy. Resolving these controversies will require robust numerical investigations to determine whether active critical exponents point to novel universality classes or are consistent with established ones. Here, we conduct large-scale computer simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of the motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) of active Brownian hard spheres in three dimensions (3D), finding that the static and dynamic critical exponents all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which flows to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and likely the entire phase diagram of active Brownian hard spheres is similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Wang, Xiaodong He, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel J. Salib, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives rise to topological insulators which are robust against sufficiently weak randomness inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation into a trivial insulator. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square-lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</p>

            <h2>Engineering stacking-induced topological phase transitions in bilayer heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjyama Bordoloi, Daniel Kaplan, Sobhit Singh</p>
            <p>Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic surface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them promising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices. Traditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion via strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC often remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design strategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin Hall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in an inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that while the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant SOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial topological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a delicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron tunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the bilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an external electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of controlling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further validate this interplay, by revealing $g$-factor suppression and the emergence a zeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a robust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway for designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems using topologically trivial constituent monolayers.</p>

            <h2>Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</p>
            <p>Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results are consistent with an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.</p>

            <p>Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image and manifests itself in diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields in it remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover a universal mechanism of spin-selective chiral photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. This mechanism embodies a chiral molecular compass - a photoinduced magnetization vector that orients the photoelectron spin. It arises in photoexcited chiral molecules even under isotropic illumination, operates even in isotropic chiral media, and enables a phenomenon central to CISS: locking of the photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. It shows that chiral molecules can sustain time-odd correlations whereas achiral molecules cannot. Our findings have broad implications, from unambiguously identifying the origin of CISS effect in photoionization to harvesting correlations underlying this effect in other forms of CISS in various chiral materials.</p>

Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the intrinsic edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case probably mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for current induced torques.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating materials simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. However, despite significant advances, we identify a critical yet overlooked issue undermining their reliability: a systematic energy underprediction. This problem becomes starkly evident in large-scale thermodynamic stability assessments. By performing over 12 million calculations using nine MLIAPs for over 150,000 inorganic crystals in the Materials Project, we demonstrate that most frontier models consistently underpredict energy above hull (Ehull), a key metric for thermodynamic stability, total energy, and formation energy, despite the fact that over 90\% of test structures (DFT-relaxed) are in the training data. The mean absolute errors (MAE) for Ehull exceed ~30 meV/atom even by the best model, directly challenging claims of achieving ``DFT accuracy'' for property predictions central to materials discovery, especially related to (meta-)stability. Crucially, we trace this underprediction to insufficient handling of symmetry degrees of freedom (DOF), constituting both lattice symmetry and Wyckoff site symmetries for the space group. MLIAPs exhibit pronounced errors (MAE for Ehull $>$ ~40 meV/atom) in structures with high symmetry DOF, where subtle atomic displacements significantly impact energy landscapes. Further analysis also indicates that the MLIAPs show severe energy underprediction for a large proportion of near-hull materials. We argue for improvements on symmetry-aware models such as explicit DOF encoding or symmetry-regularized loss functions, and more robust MLIAPs for predicting crystal properties where the preservation and breaking of symmetry are pivotal.</p>

This exciton Bose solid would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases. Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.</p>

            <p>We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</p>

By varying the polarization of the drive pulse from linear to elliptical, we realize a sensitive tuning of the third harmonic yield.

            <p>Moiré superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moiré bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moiré bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31°. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moiré bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moiré bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moiré bulk systems.</p>

We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.</p>

By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for tunable chiral channels in next generation quantum optical solid-state devices.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Hall effect in metallic collinear antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir P. Golubinskii, Vladimir A. Zyuzin</p>
            <p>We propose and theoretically study minimal models of Néel ordered collinear antiferromagnets exhibiting the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity, we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. We provide explicit examples of a Néel ordered ferrimagnet and a Dzyaloshinskii weak ferromagnet. We analyze Dzyaloshinskii's invariants for the existence of spontaneous magnetization in these Néel ordered systems. As a result, we find that the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for specific directions of the Néel order, dictated by the crystal lattice symmetries. Microscopic calculations of the Berry curvature for the studied systems confirm the validity of these Dzyaloshinskii's invariants. We show that the anomalous Hall effect mechanism in these antiferromagnets arises from the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the Néel order and the spin-orbit coupling, both originating from the broken symmetries that permit the Dzyaloshinskii's invariant in the system.</p>

            <h2>Force-induced Elastic Softening and Conformational Transitions in a Polyampholyte Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rakesh Palariya, Sunil P. Singh</p>
            <p>The mechanical response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and polyampholyte (PA) chains is vital for understanding their biological functions and designing functional materials. We investigate the force-extension behavior of a PA chain with distinct charge sequences using molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on the generalized random-phase approximation (GRPA). A diblock PA chain under extensional force undergoes a continuous coil-to-stretch transition at weak electrostatic coupling, which sharpens into a globule-coil-like transition at stronger coupling. The GRPA theory quantitatively captures these behaviors, including the sharp conformational transition and its dependence on electrostatic strength. Simulations reveal pronounced hysteresis during the force-extension and relaxation processes. Additionally, the elastic modulus exhibits four regimes: an initial plateau, stress stiffening, an exponential stress-softening behavior, and a stress stiffening regime. Using the theoretical model and structural input of the PA chain, we have demonstrated that the elastic modulus in the elastic softening regime decreases exponentially, $E\sim \exp(-\alpha_0 f/\Gamma_e)$, as a function of $f$, which aligns with the simulation results. The elastic response of the PA chain is further examined across different charge sequences, where both elastic softening and sharp transitions are absent at smaller block lengths. Finally, coarse-grained models of IDPs such as LAF-1 and DDX4 exhibit similar nonlinear elasticity, highlighting the universality of these mechanisms. Our results establish a fundamental link between electrostatic correlations, charge sequence, and nonlinear elasticity, bridging molecular interactions and macroscopic mechanics.</p>

            <p>Quantum annealing, as currently implemented in hardware, cannot fairly sample all ground states. Graph minor embedding, which maps a problem to the hardware graph of quantum annealers, affects sampling all states. In this study, we demonstrate the influence of graph minor embedding on fair sampling of degenerate ground states. For two embedded models that introduce auxiliary variables, numerical simulations of Schrödinger evolution revealed that fairness varies significantly depending on the embedding, and the chain strength is related to ground-state fairness. Using perturbation theory, we found that chain strength determines the energy landscape around ground states, with flatter landscapes having higher probabilities of being obtained.</p>

            <p>Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situation inside cells. This review discusses three distinct aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets possess complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</p>

            <p>Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator. Generally, the dimension of the density operator grows exponentially ($\sim \! 2^N$) with the number of emitters, in the absence of any symmetries such as in Dicke superradiance with full or partial permutational symmetry. We present a detailed study of the superradiant peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, for one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays in free-space and emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs. For few emitters ($N\lesssim 14$) we utilize the full quantum master equation, and for mesoscopic emitter numbers ($N\lesssim 400$) we use a second- and third-order cumulant expansion of the operator averages to track the time evolution of the system.</p>

            <p>In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum-limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. If not taken into account, the error on the signal strength can be as large as a factor of about 2, which is unacceptable for quantitative experiments. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +- 20 % limited by sources of noise internal to the optomechanical element.</p>

            <h2>Thermalization in open many-body systems and KMS detailed balance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Scandi, Álvaro M. Alhambra</p>
            <p>Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point up to a small renormalization of the system Hamiltonian, but it also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit of a coarse-graining time much larger than the inverse of the smallest frequency difference. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.</p>

Compared to the conventional single-relaxation-time BGK-FLBM, the Reg-FLBM provides improved stability and a more accurate description of thermal fluctuations. The implementation is optimized for large-scale parallel simulations on GPU-accelerated architectures, enabling systematic investigation of fluctuation-driven phenomena in mesoscale and nanoscale fluid systems.</p>

This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</p>

Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.</p>

            <h2>Probing short-range gravity using quantum reflection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Boynewicz, C. A. Sackett</p>
            <p>Quantum reflection occurs when ultra-cold atoms are incident on a material surface with sufficiently low velocity. The reflecting matter wave can interfere with the incident wave to form a detectable pattern, and this pattern contains information about atom-surface interactions at micrometer scales. We discuss how such an interferometer could be used to probe for anomalous short-range forces that are predicted by some beyond-standard model theories. We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms.</p>

            <p>Tunable sources of entangled and single photons are essential for implementing entanglement-based quantum information protocols, as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping depend on photon indistinguishability. Tunable devices are fabricated from indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanomembranes placed on monolithic piezoelectric substrates. Circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators enhance emission brightness and exploit the Purcell effect; however, the inclusion of CBGs reduces strain-mediated tunability compared to planar nanomembranes. A simple and effective solution is introduced: filling the CBG trenches with a stiff dielectric (aluminum oxide) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) restores up to 95% of the tunability of planar structures. Finite element analysis (FEA) confirms that the tunability loss originates from bending in the device layers due to strain relief in the CBG geometry. Lowering the stiffness of intermediate layers between the QDs and the piezoelectric actuator, such as in bonding or reflector layers, further increases strain losses in uncoated CBGs. Coated devices maintain 98-99% strain-tuning efficiency across all simulated underlayer stiffnesses. The results demonstrate that advantageous optical cavity properties can be effectively combined with piezoelectric strain tuning, enabling scalable, bright, and tunable quantum light sources.</p>

            <p>Quasicrystals (QCs) host long-range order without translational symmetry, a regime in which the very foundations of BCS theory are not straightforwardly applicable, yet experiments on QCs and their approximant crystals (ACs) point to conventional, $s$-wave, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity. With this work we directly address this seeming contradiction from first principles. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute the superconducting properties of the recently discovered AC Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and quantitatively reproduce its bulk $T_\text{c}$. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first \emph{ab initio} determination of $T_\text{c}$ for an AC and establishes that the electron-phonon framework is predictive in these systems as well. Using the generalized quasichemical approximation for alloy modeling in the decagonal Al-Os family, we predict tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$; in particular, Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ is dynamically stable and estimated to have a $T_\text{c}$ about 30% above Al$_{13}$Os$_4$. Finally, we argue that $T_\text{c}$ obtained for ACs provides practical bounds for the $T_\text{c}$ of their parent QCs, suggesting that the quasicrystalline counterparts of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ could harbor the highest $T_\text{c}$ among QCs yet.</p>

            <p>The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</p>

            <p>Exciton condensation--an interaction-driven, macroscopically coherent paired-fermion state--offers the prospect for dissipationless energy transport in solids, akin to that in superconductivity. Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples. Our work establishes a room-temperature excitonic platform for exploring strongly correlated many-body physics and advancing near-dissipationless, coherent quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets feature antiparallel spin sublattices with $d$-, $g$-, or $i$-wave spin order, yielding nonrelativistic spin splitting without net magnetization. We show that embedding a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet in a driven optical cavity induces a finite, tunable magnetization. Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization. This work demonstrates cavity control of altermagnets for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>An indispensable step toward understanding magnetic interactions in rare-earth magnets is to determine the spatially anisotropic single-ion properties set by crystal electric field (CEF) physics. The CEF Hamiltonian yields a discrete energy spectrum governed by a set of parameters reflecting the local site symmetry of the magnetic ion. However, experimentally determining these parameters, especially for ones at low-symmetry sites remains highly challenging. In this work, we directly measure the CEF level splittings of CsErSe2 under magnetic fields using optical spectroscopy. This enables us to determine the CEF parameters and to predict the metamagnetic-like transition arising from a level-crossing in the ground state. We also identify a level-crossing in the first excited state that leads to a non-monotonic Zeeman splitting, which strongly influences the temperature and field dependence of the magnetization. Our results highlight the capacity of single-ion physics to drive rich and unanticipated phenomena in rare-earth magnetic insulators under applied magnetic field.</p>

            <p>The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, relating the electronic thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm e}$) to the electrical conductivity, is vital in numerous applications such as in the design of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). While the WF law is generally robust, violations are frequently observed, typically manifesting in a reduced Lorenz number ($L$) relative to the Sommerfeld value ($L_0$) due to inelastic scattering. Here, we report a pronounced departure from the WF law in the topological semimetal CoSi, where the electronic Lorenz number ($L_{\rm e}$) instead rises up to $\sim40\%$ above $L_0$. We demonstrate that this anomaly arises from strong bipolar diffusive transport, enabled by topological band-induced electron-hole compensation, which allows electrons and holes to flow cooperatively and additively enhance the heat current. Concurrently, we unveil that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity is anomalously large and becomes the dominant component below room temperature. As a result, if $\kappa_{\rm L}$ is assumed negligible -- as conventional in metals, the resulting $L$ from the total thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm tot}=\kappa_{\rm L}+\kappa_{\rm e}$) deviates from $L_0$ by more than a factor of three. Our work provides deeper insight into the unconventional thermal transport physics in topological semimetals.</p>

Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and a novel athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gal Shavit, Gil Refael</p>
            <p>Strongly correlated quantum materials exhibit a rich landscape of ordered phases with highly tunable properties, making them an intriguing platform for exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science. Our work provides the toolbox for controlling these excitations.</p>

            <p>The ability to rapidly manipulate domain walls (DWs) in magnetic materials is key to developing novel high-speed spintronic memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics.</p>

The variation in magnetic permeability enables tuning between repulsive and attractive interaction and a thermally unstable and measurable magnetic Casimir traps are predicted between a pair of ZnO-PS nanoparticles whose equilibrium position can be modulated over an order of magnitude with a small variation in the size of the magnetite nanoparticle. This provides an alternative magnetic Casimir-effect pathway to reversibly tune quantum electromagnetic forces at the nanoscale for assembly and enhancement of colloidal stability.</p>

            <h2>Angular Patterns of Photoluminescence in Quantum Dot Spherical Superparticles Mediated by Whispering-Gallery Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu. E. Geints</p>
            <p>Quantum dot superparticles are a specific class of metamaterials created through the self-assembly of nanometer semiconductor quantum dots into organized micro-scale structures, such as microspheres. Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle.</p>

            <h2>High and Magnetic-field-dependent Surface Carriers Mobility in 3D Topological Insulators without Bulk States</h2>

            <p>By applying the conventional two-liquid model to the magnetoresistivity tensor, we reveal a record-high carrier mobility for surface states in tetradymite topological insulators ($\sim$ 20000 cm$^2$/Vs) in both bulk crystals and thin flakes of Sn-Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S. Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neetesh Dhakar, Sunil Kumar</p>
            <p>Following the ultrafast photoexcitation of a semiconductor, it embodies competing dynamics among photocarriers, many-body transient states of highly energetic excitons, and electron-hole liquid. Here, we show that femtosecond optical pulse excitation induces transient excitonic shift current contributing to stronger THz emission from a single crystalline bulk MoS2 at low temperatures. The control of dominating excitonic shift current is elucidated from excitation density dependent experiments at varying temperatures. A strong decrease in the excitonic contribution beyond a critical fluence of 150microJ/cm^2 is observed at a very low temperature of 20K. This behavior suggests the formation of a new quantum condensate, i.e., the electron-hole liquid, in the regime when the exciton density is overwhelmingly large that the average spacing between exciton pairs is comparable to the exciton radius. Furthermore, the exciton density dependent THz emission at varying temperatures is consistent with the Varshni model and the crystal Debye temperature of 260K.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions are essential devices in superconducting electronics and quantum computing hardware. Here we predict electrical control of the supercurrent in composite superconductor-insulator-ferroelectric-insulator-superconductor (S-I-FE-I-S) Josephson junctions. Inversion symmetry broken by unequal dielectric barrier thicknesses and/or potentials converts ferroelectric polarization reversal into a substantial change of the critical current. With a WKB tunneling model we obtain non-volatile switching of the critical current with on-off efficiency up to 0.9 for physically realistic parameters. This can be achieved by optimizing the thicknesses and potential barriers of the insulating layers, as well as the thickness and dielectric constant of the ferroelectric layer. We also derive a compact linear expression for the critical current valid for small polarizations. Our results identify ferroelectric Josephson junctions as electrically programmable superconducting current switches for cryogenic memory and logic applications.</p>

Our single-shot microscopic images together with the real-time readout of the cavity photons provide access to atom-photon correlations. We use this capability to investigate order fluctuations as a function of time following a quench and to directly confirm the correspondence between optical and atomic observables.

            <p>In Szilard's engine, measurement and feedback allows to extract work from an equilibrium environment, a process otherwise forbidden by the laws of thermodynamics. Recent theoretical developments have established fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations that constrain the fluctuations in Szilard's engine. These relations rely on auxiliary experimental protocols known as backward experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the thermodynamics of Szilard's engine by implementing two distinct types of backward experiments. We verify and compare the corresponding fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations associated with each protocol. Our results reveal that the entropy production inferable from measurement may serve as a more relevant quantifier of information than the widely used mutual information.</p>

            <p>We investigate the phase diagram of a relativistic, parametrically driven O($N$)-symmetric theory coupled to a Markovian thermal bath. Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity.</p>

            <p>In a recent paper [JHEP 11 (2020) 118], S. Giombi and H. Khanchandani studied the 1/N expansion of the O(N) model in semi-infinite space within the framework of conformal field theory in anti-de Sitter space. They presented a series expansion for the O(1/N) correction to the boundary anomalous dimension in the case of the ordinary transition. Although they were unable to sum the series or simplify its form analytically, they demonstrated numerically that their result matches our earlier, simple analytic expression given in Prog. Theor. Phys. 70 (1983) 1226. In this paper, we show that their series expansion is in fact exactly equivalent to our original expression. However, since the final formula in eq. (4.57) of their paper, which is expressed in terms of two different 3F2 functions, cannot produce the correct values, we derive the correct formulae involving two 3F2 functions in the Appendices. We comment on the similarity and difference between their analysis and ours in the cases of the ordinary and special transitions, and present full details of deriving the anomalous dimension for all the cases including the extraordinary transition, which were not written in our earlier paper.</p>

            <p>Elucidating the emergence of irreversible macroscopic laws from reversible quantum many-body dynamics is a question of broad importance across all quantum science. Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes. These findings establish a microscopic framework for manipulating decoherence pathways and suggests engineered disorder as a new design principle for realizing long-lived quantum memories and sensors.</p>

            <p>Electron ptychography enables dose-efficient atomic-resolution imaging, but conventional reconstruction algorithms suffer from noise sensitivity, slow convergence, and extensive manual hyperparameter tuning for regularization, especially in three-dimensional multislice reconstructions. We introduce a deep generative prior (DGP) framework for electron ptychography that uses the implicit regularization of convolutional neural networks to address these challenges. Two DGPs parameterize the complex-valued sample and probe within an automatic-differentiation mixed-state multislice forward model. Compared to pixel-based reconstructions, DGPs offer four key advantages: (i) greater noise robustness and improved information limits at low dose; (ii) markedly faster convergence, especially at low spatial frequencies; (iii) improved depth regularization; and (iv) minimal user-specified regularization. The DGP framework promotes spatial coherence and suppresses high-frequency noise without extensive tuning, and a pre-training strategy stabilizes reconstructions. Our results establish DGP-enabled ptychography as a robust approach that reduces expertise barriers and computational cost, delivering robust, high-resolution imaging across diverse materials and biological systems.</p>

            <p>Optomechanical sensors enable exquisitely sensitive force measurements, with emerging applications across quantum technologies, standards, fundamental science, and engineering. Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration.</p>

            <h2>Mixed-state phase structure of gauge-Higgs subsystem codes under logical-preserving decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Some of lattice-gauge-theory models, in particular gauge-Higgs model (GHM), can be regarded and work as a subsystem code. This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits.</p>

            <p>Surface bubbles are an abundant source of aerosols, with important implications for climate processes. In this context, we investigate the stability and thinning dynamics of soap films under effective gravity fields. Experiments are performed using a centrifugal thin-film balance capable of generating accelerations from 0.2 up to 100 times standard gravity, combined with thin-film interferometry to obtain time-resolved thickness maps. Across all experimental conditions, the drainage dynamics are shown to be governed by capillary suction and marginal regeneration-a mechanism in which thick regions of the film are continuously replaced by thin film elements (TFEs) formed at the meniscus. We consistently recover a thickness ratio of 0.8 - 0.9 between the TFEs and the adjacent film, in agreement with previous observations under standard gravity. The measured thinning rates also follow the predicted scaling laws. We identified that gravity has three distinct effects: (i) it induces a strong stretching of the initial film, extending well beyond the linear-elastic regime; (ii) it controls the meniscus size, and thereby the amplitude of the capillary suction and the drainage rate; and (iii) it reveals an inertia-to-viscous transition in the motion of TFEs within the film. These results are supported by theoretical modeling and highlight the robustness of marginal regeneration and capillary-driven drainage under extreme gravity conditions.</p>

At any given order the semiclassical expansion resums an infinite number of Feynman diagrams. Combining our results with existing perturbative computations further yields the complete five-loop scaling dimensions in the $\epsilon$-expansion for the family of $\phi^n$ operators. Finally, in three dimensions the next-to-leading order semiclassical results supersede any other existing methodology for $n \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10)$.</p>

            <p>We present a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine from the non-poikilitic lithology of the poikilitic shergottite NWA 7721, using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and context in situ 2D micro-XRD. A single olivine crystal contains two distinct subgrain populations. Type 1 subgrains are fine (1-5 micrometers), randomly oriented, and nearly strain-free, whereas Type 2 subgrains are coarse (greater than 30 micrometers), aligned, and strongly strained. Layered DFXM data reveal slip-band features in Type 2 that are absent in Type 1. We interpret Type 1 as products of shock-induced recrystallization, whereas Type 2 preserves remnants of a highly deformed parent grain. This bimodal microstructure, not observed in other Martian meteorites including the paired NWA 1950 and ALH A77005, points to a heterogeneous response to impact influenced by pre-existing strain in the olivine grain. We propose that NWA 7721 olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress before impact. The subsequent shock wave imposed a rapid load-release cycle that mobilized dislocations and produced low-angle boundaries in Type 2, while driving recrystallization of Type 1. Grain-growth constraints limit the post-shock heating duration to approximately 2.3 s, consistent with rapid quenching. These results provide the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars in the Late Amazonian.</p>

            <p>We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.</p>

            <p>We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</p>

The counterdiabatic method offers an analytical framework for accelerating high-fidelity gates by mimicking the time evolution of a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian using fast-oscillating fields. This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms. It stresses the important role played by constraints on the optimized pulses in time and in amplitude that are crucial in determining the quality of the optimization method.</p>

            <p>Recently, Mendonça et al. [arXiv:2503.04961] investigated the Dicke-XXZ model and the Dicke-Ising model. For the latter model, their calculated quantum phase diagram contradicts claims about the existence of an intermediate phase with superradiant and antiferromagnetic order and the change in order of some phase transition lines, observed in other studies. In this comment we demonstrate that both features are indeed present in the Dicke-Ising model for the investigated parameter range in [arXiv:2503.04961].</p>

            <h2>Design boosters: from constant-time quantum chaos to $\infty$-designs and beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumik Ghosh, Arjun Mirani, Yihui Quek, Michelle Xu</p>
            <p>We study a counterintuitive property of 'conditioning' on the result of measuring a subsystem of a quantum state: such conditioning can boost design quality, at the cost of increased system size. We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.</p>

            <h2>Bootstrapping Euclidean Two-point Correlators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minjae Cho, Barak Gabai, Henry W. Lin, Jessica Yeh, Zechuan Zheng</p>
            <p>We develop a bootstrap approach to Euclidean two-point correlators, in the thermal or ground state of quantum mechanical systems. We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become "inequalities of motion" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. K. Behera, P. C. Ramamurthy</p>
            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials that exhibit a diverse range of electronic structures, including charge density waves (CDWs) that can lead to insulating, semiconducting, metallic, and even superconducting phases. While the formation of CDWs in these systems has been recognized in early research [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 156401 (2022); Nat. Phys. 11, 328 (2015)], the underlying mechanisms driving the commensurate CDW (CCDW) phase remain largely unexplored. CCDWs typically originate from factors such as perfect Fermi surface nesting and/or electron-phonon coupling, causing the divergence of the chiral electronic structure. However, in the case of layered 2D TMD materials with CCDW phases, the significance of reconstructed electronic structures resulting from periodic lattice distortions (PLD) and photoemission matrix element effects in the CCDW instability needs to be visualized. This study focuses on computationally accessible CCDW phases in 1T-Ta$S_2$, a prototypical TMD with a rich CDW phase diagram, aiming to understand the origins of CCDW phases. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to advance the application of 2D materials in next-generation electronics, quantum sensing and information science.</p>

            <p>Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</p>

            <p>Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations.

            <p>Deterministic optimization algorithms unequivocally partition a complex energy landscape in inherent structures (ISs) and their respective basins of attraction. Can these basins be defined solely through geometric principles? This question is paramount to understanding hard sphere jamming, a key model of disordered matter. We here address the issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent-like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting ISs is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs, which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class. Along the way, the physical origin of a dynamical Gardner transition is identified.</p>

            <p>TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a topological metal where ferromagnetic Tb ions with strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy interact with V kagome layers. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements show that the Tb ions adopt an Ising doublet ground state. Here, we consider whether a transverse magnetic field can drive TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ toward a quantum critical point, providing a rare example of transverse-field Ising criticality in a metallic compound. High-field magnetization measurements reveal a first-order-like spin-reorientation transition at 25.6 T. Our INS-based magnetic model finds that this is caused by an avoided crossing of an excited-state singlet with the ground-state doublet. Surprisingly, our model predicts that quantum critical and tricritical points are accessible within the range of experimentally determined model parameters and may be reached by varying the direction of an applied magnetic field.</p>

            <p>The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium.

Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath, Simon B. Jäger</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry L.F. Ip, Charlie Mathey, Laurent Mertz, Jonathan J. Wylie</p>
            <p>We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. Our approach uses a coupling between the white-noise-driven process and the coloured-noise-driven process, yielding a variance-reduced estimator through control variate techniques. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.</p>

            <p>We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method to quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological information of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament fabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles embedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through an aluminum nozzle in a custom setup comparable to commercial printers. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations from classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and non-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine the local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced non-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions, reflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. We complement the experiments with computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow inside the printing nozzle, incorporating filament melting through an enthalpy-porosity formulation and treating the air-polymer melt interface using a two-phase approach. The simulated velocity profiles agree closely with the XPTV measurements across the investigated operating conditions, supporting the experimental interpretation. Our findings demonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and rheological properties, underscoring its potential as a tool for investigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial processing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this is the first application of XPTV to polymer melt rheology. It enables measurements that are inaccessible to conventional optical methods.</p>

In this research, we present the synthesis of a new 2D dielectric, monolayer InO2, which differs in stoichiometry from its bulk form, over a large area (>300 um2) by intercalating at the epitaxial graphene (EG)/SiC interface. By adjusting the lateral size of graphene through optical lithography prior to the intercalation, we tune the thickness of InO2 where predominantly (~85%) monolayer InO2 is formed. The preference for monolayer formation of InO2 is explained using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, the band gap of InO2 is calculated to be 4.1 eV, differing from its bulk form (2.7 eV). Furthermore, MOS-based Schottky diode measurements on InO2 intercalated EG/n-SiC demonstrate that the EG/n-SiC junction transforms from ohmic to a Schottky junction upon intercalation, with a barrier height of 0.87 eV and a rectification ratio of ~10^5. These findings introduce a new addition to the 2D dielectric family, showing significant potential for monolayer InO2 to be used as a barrier in vertical electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum phenomena arising from the interplay between electron correlations and nontrivial topology. However, the microscopic mechanism governing the emergence of both the integer and fractional Chern insulator states in this system remains an open question. In this work, we systematically investigate the electrical transport properties of RMG/hBN moiré devices with controlled alignment orientations and twist angles. We demonstrate that alignment orientation strongly modulates correlated phenomena in the moiré-proximal regime, while having negligible influence on the formation of integer and fractional Chern insulators in the moiré-distant regime. Instead, the moiré periodicity, tuned by the twist angle, serves as the key parameter controlling the stability of these correlated topological states in the moiré-distant regime. Furthermore, in the moiré-proximal regime of one specific alignment, we observe anomalous Hall effect and a variety of competing phases near {\nu} = 1, including integer Chern insulator states, extended Chern insulator states, and trivial insulators, whose stability is highly sensitive to both the applied displacement electric field and magnetic field. Our results underscore the critical role of stacking-alignment and twist-angle engineering in exploring novel quantum states based on rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene moiré systems.</p>

            <p>High-mobility oxide heterostructures could be applied for high-frequency devices, transparent conductors, and spin-orbit logic devices. SrTiO$_3$ is one of the most studied oxide substrate materials for heterostructures. To date, the highest SrTiO3-based charge carrier mobility at 2 K was measured in the interfacial 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The formation mechanism and origin of the high electron mobility are not yet fully understood. This investigation presents a successful growth protocol to synthesise high mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, and a description of the underlying growth optimisation. Furthermore, indicative features of high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, including the room-temperature sheet resistance, are presented. Signs of epitaxial and crystalline growth are found in a high-mobility sample ($\mu^{10K} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{Vs}$). Outlining the growth mechanisms and comparing 40 samples, indicates that high-fluence ($F > 3\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) and low pressure ($P \approx 1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{mbar}$) are essential growth parameters for high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ having single-element cations allows higher laser fluences during growth, compared to thin films with multi-element cations such as LaAlO$_3$, without causing stoichiometric imbalances.</p>

            <p>Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded $\pi$-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials that are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) is synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, the quantum transport properties of hNPGs are studied. It is found that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). A simple model is proposed to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, it is found that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</p>

            <p>We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three- dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manabu Sato, Shingo Kobayashi, Motoaki Hirayama, Akira Furusaki</p>
            <p>The Euler class is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariant that characterizes a pair of real bands in a two-dimensional Brillouin zone. One of the symmetries that permits its definition is $C_{2z}T$, where $C_{2z}$ denotes a twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and $T$ denotes time-reversal symmetry. Here, we study three-dimensional spinless insulators characterized by the Euler class, focusing on the case where additional $C_{4z}$ or $C_{6z}$ rotational symmetry is present, and investigate the relationship between the Euler class of the occupied bands and their rotation eigenvalues. We first consider two-dimensional systems and clarify the transformation rules for the real Berry connection and curvature under point group operations, using the corresponding sewing matrices. Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we obtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation eigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to three-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class between the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that relate the difference in the Euler class to two types of representation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We further construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to support our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Moy</p>
            <p>We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between gapped phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between a gapped phase in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and a phase where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We characterize the possible patterns of symmetry fractionalization in these phases and provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits the transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K Shivanand Thakur, Vihodi Theuno, Amrita Mukherjee, Biplab Pal</p>
            <p>In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</p>

            <h2>Third-order strong-coupling impurity solver for real-frequency DMFT: Accurate spectral functions for antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Geng, Aaram J. Kim, Philipp Werner</p>
            <p>We present a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver which employs quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) for an efficient evaluation of the diagram weights. Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium DMFT studies.</p>

            <h2>On the criticality of the configuration-space statistical geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Jing Liu, Wen-Yu Su, Yong-Feng Yang, Nvsen Ma, Chen Cheng</p>
            <p>While phases and phase transitions are conventionally described by local order parameters in real space, we present a unified framework characterizing the phase transition through the geometry of configuration space defined by the statistics of pairwise distances $r_H$ between configurations. Focusing on the concrete example of Ising spins, we establish crucial analytical links between this geometry and fundamental real-space observables, i.e., the magnetization and two-point spin correlation functions. This link unveils the universal scaling law in the configuration space: the standard deviation of the normalized distances exhibits universal criticality as $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(r_H)}\sim L^{-2\beta/\nu}$, provided that the system possesses zero magnetization and satisfies $4\beta/\nu < d$. We validate this scaling with stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the transverse-field Ising model(TFIM). Furthermore, we propose configuration-space diagnostics that go beyond local real-space observables. First, the distribution probability $P(r_H)$ parameterized by the transverse field $h$ forms a one-dimensional manifold. Information-geometric analyses, particularly the Fisher information defined on this manifold, successfully pinpoint the TFIM phase transition, regardless of the measurement basis. Second, for the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Heisenberg model, a parity index derived from $P(r_H)$ successfully characterizes the symmetry-protected topological phase and its transition. Our work establishes configuration space geometry as a novel perspective on quantum criticality, revealing how macroscopic universal phenomena are encoded within its global statistical features.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Holly C. M. Baldock, David M. Huang</p>
            <p>Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--Hückel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is an intrinsic property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could help to explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamic behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with dipolar interactions when the influence of external electric fields affects the coherent tunneling properties. Here, we propose a tunable platform based on BECs where Josephson oscillations can be engineered and modulated through external electric fields. We develop a theoretical and numerical frame-work that reveals how electric fields affect intercondensate tunneling, phase dynamics, and collective excitations. By employing a coupled set of Gross-Pitaevskii equations with adiabatic elimination of excited states, we demonstrate field-induced tuning of Josephson frequencies and a transition from contact to dipole-dominated regimes. These findings corroborate theoretical predictions about the sensitivity of dipolar BECs to external fields and deepen our understanding of quantum coherence and tunneling in long-range interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.</p>

            <h2>Ge as an orbitronic platform: giant orbital Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James H. Cullen, Zhanning Wang, Dimitrie Culcer</p>
            <p>State-of-the-art developments in magnetic devices rely on manufacturing faster, more efficient memory elements. A significant development in this direction has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital angular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent ferromagnet, and has motivated the search for orbitronic materials displaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We demonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the bulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by four orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of the Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while incorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study constitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system with inversion symmetry. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an ideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the spin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our results provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic devices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.</p>

            <p>A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic order. In rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, the angular momentum that breaks TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature at the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (R6G), achieved without the introduction of a moiré superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of R6G. Our findings present crystalline R6G as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insights into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</p>

            <h2>Retardance of lab grown diamond substrates as a function of thickness: momentum-drift random walk model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thanh Tran, Phuong Vo, Thomas Sheppard, Timothy Grotjohn, Paul Quayle</p>
            <p>This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Iacovelli, Josep Cabedo, Leticia Tarruell, Alessio Celi</p>
            <p>Topological gauge theories constitute a framework for understanding strongly correlated quantum matter in terms of weakly interacting composite degrees of freedom. Their topological properties become evident when these theories are realized on a space of non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a scheme to realize a one-dimensional topological gauge theory, the chiral BF theory, on a ring geometry. We obtain such a theory by dimensionally reducing Chern-Simons theory on a disk to the so-called chiral BF theory defined on the ring. Then, we encode the theory into a Hamiltonian with a coupling between angular momentum and density, and we propose and numerically benchmark its realization in an optically-dressed Bose gas confined in a ring-shaped trap. There, the topological properties of the underlying theory manifest themselves through a magnetic flux variable that is density-dependent. We quantify such density-dependent magnetic flux in terms of the ground-state angular momentum and the chiral properties of the system through a Bogoliubov analysis. Our proposal enables the observation of the interplay between the topology of the theory and that of the space.</p>

            <p>Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions. Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing, offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time prediction tasks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumyaditya Das, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Muktish Acharyya, Bikas K. Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension (for non-equilibrium cases) of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each component following Suzuki--Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of an oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field, which provides a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes--Suzuki--Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.</p>

            <p>Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or by limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets - exemplified by experimentally feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistances of 11,704%, 2,496% and 1,892%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of the electrodes and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and zero stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and vanishing magnetic moment, combining the advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a practically versatile platform to realize the revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</p>

            <h2>Toward a Deterministic Nucleation Theory for Chirality-Controlled Nanotube Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengrong Guo</p>
            <p>The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are governed by their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). While chirality-controlled synthesis has achieved notable successes, theoretical understanding remains predominantly focused on post-nucleation growth. Two fundamental obstacles impede deeper insight: the absence of a clear description of nucleation cap topology and its connection to tube chirality, and an incomplete understanding of atomic-level mechanisms governing templated cap formation. Here we address these challenges directly. First, we develop a mathematically rigorous topological framework for carbon networks that provides both a concise definition of cap structures and a quantitative relationship between cap architecture and chirality-the vector sum rule. Second, contrary to conventional perspectives attributing chirality enrichment to edge matching during growth, we demonstrate that chirality is deterministically encoded during nucleation through selective formation of specific cap structures on catalyst surfaces. For the specific case of (12,6) nanotubes, we show that their enrichment arises from a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to catalyst facets. Our deterministic nucleation theory not only provides a coherent explanation for chirality enrichment but also elucidates its pattern in chirality space. This work establishes a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the paradigm from stochastic growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.</p>

            <p>The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents.</p>

            <p>The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.</p>

            <p>Moiré patterns arising from twisted van der Waals stacks fundamentally reshape their electronic properties, enabling band-structure engineering that has driven rapidly growing interest in this field. In studying electronic properties, however, structural disorder present in real devices often leads to twist-angle inhomogeneity and obscures angle-dependent electronic effects when measured with bulk-averaged measurements. Probes that can access local thermodynamic response of the electronic systems with high sensitivity would be highly valuable. Here, we adopt Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to locally investigate graphene-hBN superlattices. By additionally modulating the chemical potential of the system, we obtain the inverse compressibility with high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling extraction of the local thermodynamic DOS. From this information, we determine the local twist angle along the device and find that twist-angle deviations are strongly correlated with bubble-induced strain features. Furthermore, by simultaneously tracking the offsets in the contact potential difference and in the net charge, we identify which interface within the heterostructure hosts the trapped bubbles. This capability to identify local electro-chemical environments provides a practical tool for strain-based studies and future device designs utilizing nanoscale engineering in moiré systems.</p>

            <p>We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</p>

By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.</p>

            <p>Visibility graphs are spatial interpretations of time series. When derived from the time evolution of physical systems, the graphs associated with such series may exhibit properties that can reflect aspects such as ergodicity, criticality, or other dynamical behaviors. It is important to describe how the criticality of a system is manifested in the structure of the corresponding graphs or, in a particular way, in the spectra of certain matrices constructed from them. In this paper, we show how the critical behavior of an Ising spin system manifests in the spectra of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices constructed from an ensemble of time evolutions simulated via Monte Carlo (MC) Markov Chains, even for small systems and short MC steps. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees -- or its logarithm -- , which represents a kind of \emph{structural entropy} or \emph{topological complexity} here obtained from Kirchhoff's theorem, can, in an alternative way, describe the criticality of the spin system. These findings parallel those obtained from the spectra of correlation matrices, which similarly encode signatures of critical and chaotic behavior.</p>

Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields.

            <p>Stacking faults and other topological defects in ferroics can have a significant influence on the electronic and mechanical properties of the material. Here, regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$ are investigated through transmission electron microscopy, symmetry mode analysis and machine-learned force-field calculations. It is shown that the faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four in the material, owing to the $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell displacement along the b-axis. The four resulting domains emerge as four possible directions of the S$_3$ order parameter, related to NbO$_6$ octahedral tilts in the material. Force-field calculations reveal that the stacking faults are likely placed at positions where the octahedra in neighbouring domains have similar magnitudes of rotation, and that the estimated stacking fault energy is 46 mJ/m$^2$. The investigation shows that the stacking faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, and therefore could affect the ferroelectric properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsz Wai Ko, Runze Liu, Adesh Rohan Mishra, Zihan Yu, Ji Qi, Shyue Ping Ong</p>
            <p>Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.</p>

            <h2>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saori Morimoto, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai</p>
            <p>We introduce two kinds of matrix-valued dynamical processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with the additive rank 1 perturbations $\delta J$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the numerically obtained eigenvalues. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero simple eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around $\lambda_0$ are the exact eigenvalues not of the original system, but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. The complex domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$ of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Such separation of exact simple eigenvalues and a degenerated eigenvalue associated with pseudospectrum will be meaningful for numerical analysis, since the former is stable and robust, but the latter is highly sensitive and unstable with respective to perturbations. The present study will be related to the pseudospectra approaches to non-Hermitian systems developed in quantum physics</p>

            <h2>Natural gradient and parameter estimation for quantum Boltzmann machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we establish formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saori Morimoto, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai</p>
            <p>We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</p>

            <p>Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic Table, also known as "triel elements," have great potential for a new generation of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a triel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed before a triel is ready for modern ultracold quantum science experiments in optical traps. Reaching this regime typically requires atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and confined in a laser field. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we trap indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.</p>

            <h2>CaF+CaF interactions in the ground and excited electronic states: implications for collisional losses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dibyendu Sardar, Marcin Gronowski, Michał Tomza, John L. Bohn</p>
            <p>Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</p>

            <h2>Spatially Correlated Noise Induces Transitions from the Diffusive to Ballistic Regime in Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse</p>
            <p>We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated noise, characterized by a single length scale, and constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation--dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length \(\ell\) and the correlation strength \(\beta\). Intuitively, increasing \(\ell\) enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, because a larger correlation length slows viscous momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing \(\beta\) also increases the MSD, because a weaker correlation strength decelerates fluid momentum diffusion. Thus, the emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from the competition between momentum correlation and viscous dissipation. We further show that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equation, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Henriksson, Franz Herzog, Stefanos R. Kousvos, Jasper Roosmale Nepveu</p>
            <p>We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena. The computed scaling dimensions agree well with known non-perturbative results, and they lead to new predictions where such results do not yet exist. We thereby expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</p>

            <h2>Universal Frequency Correlations and Recurrence Statistics of Complex Impedance Matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadav Shaibe, Jared Erb, Thomas M. Antonsen, Steven M. Anlage</p>
            <p>Linear electromagnetic wave scattering systems can be characterized by an impedance matrix that relates the voltages and currents at the ports of the system. When the system size becomes greater than the wavelength of the fields involved, the impedance matrix becomes a complicated function of the details of the system, in which case a statistical model, such as the Random Coupling Model (RCM) becomes useful. The statistics of the elements of the RCM impedance matrix depend on the excitation frequency, the spectral density of the modes of the enclosed system volume, the average loss factor (Q^{-1}) of the system, and the properties of the coupling ports as given by their radiation impedances. In this paper, properties of the elements of impedance matrices are explored numerically and experimentally. These include the two point frequency correlation functions for the complex impedance of elements and the expected difference in frequencies between which impedance values are approximately repeated. Universal scaling arguments are then given for these quantities, hence these results are generic for all sufficiently complicated scattering systems, including acoustic and optical systems. The experimental data presented in this paper come from microwave graphs, billiards, and three-dimensional cavities with embedded tunable perturbers such as metasurfaces. The data is found to be in generally good agreement with the predictions for the two point frequency correlations and the frequency interval for successive repetitions of impedance matrix elements values.</p>

            <p>Ideal symmetry is known to break down under almost any noise. One measure of asymmetry in a periodic crystal is the relative multiplicity Z' of geometrically non-equivalent units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations. We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify (in physically meaningful Angstroms) the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetry form. Our experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction datasets show that many simulated crystals may be non-synthesisable not only due to high energy but also due to high CIA values, which are much faster to compute. On another hand, many crystals with high Z' values in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be close to more symmetric forms with Z'<=1 due to low CIA values.</p>

Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.</p>

            <p>This work analyzes anisotropic Dirac materials, such as graphene and borophene, under inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields with position-dependent profiles. Exact solutions of the Dirac--Weyl equation are obtained for singular and exponentially decaying interactions, showing how anisotropy and field shape influence the energy spectrum, Landau levels, and state localization. The analysis is further extended using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) in its perturbative form, applied to systems with bounded domains $( -\infty, x_0 ]$ or $( 0, x_0 ]$. In particular, we consider the case $( -\infty, x_0 ]$, where the field vanishes asymptotically. The first-order corrections reveal how the finite range $x_0$ modifies localization and transport, and how a critical electric field emerges at which Landau levels collapse, providing insight into the design of field-defined regions in two-dimensional nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Surface modification of TiO2 with single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective strategy for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. However, thorough characterization of SACs at the atomic scale remains challenging. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) offers unique advantages for the in-depth analysis of TiO2-supported SACs. By employing XAS, the local atomic structure, oxidation state, and electronic properties of the SACs, as well as the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, can be revealed. Herein, we present a short review on the application of XAS in studying TiO2-supported SACs. We first elucidate the key role of XAS in simultaneously probing the structure and electronic properties of monometallic SACs across different periods. Next, we discuss XAS studies of bimetallic SACs from the perspective of each constituent element and highlight the element-specific capabilities of XAS for analyzing multi-element SACs. Finally, we demonstrate how in situ XAS can effectively monitor structural and electronic property changes in SACs under real photocatalytic reaction conditions. Additionally, we provide practical suggestions for utilizing XAS more efficiently in the analysis of various SAC systems.</p>

            <p>Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.</p>

Here, we demonstrate controllable superconductivity in suspended NbSe2 thin layers, achieved through local strain and thermal modulation of the superconducting state. Our results show that suspended NbSe2 structures enable strain modulation of the critical temperature by up to approximately 0.92 K (about 12.5% of the critical temperature) and allow the realization of gate-tunable superconducting critical currents. We further demonstrate configurable hysteretic transport characteristics exhibiting multistability and negative differential resistance, providing easily reconfigurable, spatially dependent superconducting states. These phenomena are well explained by calculations of electron-phonon coupling using density functional theory, together with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau dynamics coupled to the thermal diffusion equation.

These interactions frustrate conventional magnetic order and give rise to rich collective behavior that continues to challenge both theory and experiment. While Kitaev physics has been extensively explored in the context of honeycomb magnets, direct evidence for its role in real materials remains scarce. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring low-dimensional electrical, magnetic, and correlated electronic phenomena, and provide a fertile ground for potential applications ranging from spintronics to multiferroic devices and quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate, through magneto-transmission, Faraday angle rotation, and magnetic circular dichroism measurements, that the magnetic excitation spectrum of NiI$_2$, a van der Waals multiferroic material, is more accurately captured by a Kitaev-based spin model than by the previously invoked helical spin framework.</p>

Our findings show that the Voting Ensemble model, when combined with Monte Carlo cross-validation, achieves the highest prediction accuracy. The normalized root mean squared error serves as the primary performance metric. For implementation, we utilize the Azure Machine Learning framework for its robust computational and integration capabilities. This approach offers an efficient and reliable strategy for designing and predicting the Curie temperature of ternary alloys.

The phononic transparency and opacity effects are demonstrated numerically from the frequency dependence of the transmission coefficient.

            <p>Lactose is the major component of milk powders and is normally found to be in a glassy/amorphous state. During storage, lactose is known to participate in physicochemical processes, including crystallization on the surface and reaction with proteins such as $\beta$-lactoglobulin. Lactose needs to be mobile to participate in such processes. However, there is a lack of evidence of its mobility in milk powders. In this study, we demonstrate that some of the lactose becomes mobile when milk powders are exposed to humid air $-$ an inappropriate storage condition. This mobility is evidenced by peaks in magic angle spinning $^{1}\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectra of milk powders in the range of 3.5 ppm to 4.0 ppm, which stem from lactose molecules displaying considerable rotational mobility. These signals have a longitudinal relaxation time constant T1 similar to that of mobile water according to 2D T1$-\delta(^{1}\mathrm{H})$ experiments under magic angle spinning. Furthermore, 2D $^{1}\mathrm{H}-^{13}\mathrm{C}$ HSQC magic angle spinning experiments of skim milk powder demonstrate the same fingerprint as that of lactose in the solution, confirming our observations.</p>

An antiferromagnetic transition at 293 K is unambiguously evidenced from the measurements of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. In addition, a secondary transition at $\sim$70 K is also observed, possibly associated with a Lifshitz transition. The first-principles calculations indicate robust Néel-type collinear antiferromagnetism in the V$_2$O plane. Consequently, spin splittings show up in momentum space, in relation with the real-space mirror/rotation symmetry. Interestingly, the V-$d_{yz}/d_{xz}$ electrons, which primarily contribute the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface, turns out to be fully orbital- and spin-polarized, akin to the case of a half metal. Our work lays a solid foundation on the potential applications utilizing altermagnetic properties in vanadium-based oxychalcogenides.</p>

            <h2>Density-dependent sodium-storage mechanisms in hard carbon materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexis Front, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Miguel A. Caro</p>
            <p>Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remains poorly understood. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal that increasing carbon density reduces pore size and accessibility, thereby modulating the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity ($\approx 400$ mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($<10$\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability.</p>

            <h2>Ultra-long-range spin coupling in graphene revealed by atomically resolved spin excitations</h2>

            <p>Magnetic interactions between localized spins-1/2 play a central role in quantum magnetism, spin-based quantum computing, and quantum simulation. The range and strength of these interactions are key figures of merit. Here, we probe exchange interactions in pairs and trimers of spins-1/2 introduced by chemisorption of individual hydrogen atoms on graphene. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, supported by large-scale mean-field Hubbard calculations, we demonstrate 3 meV exchange couplings at separations beyond 10 nm, surpassing all prior systems. The couplings can be ferro- or antiferromagnetic depending on the relative sublattice arrangement. Real-space mapping of spin excitation amplitudes enables characterization with atomic-resolution. Through atomic manipulation we extend this control to spin trimers, revealing collective spin excitations when pairwise exchange couplings are comparable.</p>

            <h2>Plasmon resonance in a sub-THz graphene-based detector: theory and experiment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I.M. Moiseenko, E. Titova, M. Kashchenko, D. Svintsov</p>
            <p>We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of photovoltage generation in a bilayer graphene (BLG) transistor structure exposed to subterahertz radiation. The device features a global bottom and split top gate, enabling independent control of the band gap and Fermi level, thereby enabling the formation of a tunable p-n junction in graphene. Measurements show that the photovoltage arises primarily through a thermoelectric mechanism driven by heating of the p-n junction in the middle of the channel. We also provide a theoretical justification for the excitation of two-dimensional plasmons at a record-low frequency of 0.13 THz, which manifests itself as characteristic oscillations in the measured photovoltage. These plasmonic resonances, activated by a decrease in charge carrier concentration due to opening of the band gap, lead to a local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and an increase in the carrier temperature in the junction region. The record-low frequency of plasmon resonance is enabled by the low carrier density achievable in the bilayer graphene upon electrical induction of the band gap.</p>

            <h2>Controlling the Size of Nanoparticles Using a Magnetic Field: A Sphere Packing Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yazeed Tawalbeh, Marwa Ghazi, Mauro Fernandes Pereira</p>
            <p>We present an analytical framework that predicts and controls nanoparticle size through external magnetic fields, uniting first-principles thermodynamics with a sphere packing approach. Calibrated to diamagnetic silver nanoparticles (20 nm at zero field and 5 nm at 250 mT), the model yields a closed-form relation between radius and field that reproduces the observed shift in most-probable size. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the field lowers the nucleation barrier and drives the distribution toward smaller particles. Our results are robust for radii above 3 nm (5740 atoms). Below this scale non-extensive effects likely dominate, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Information. The approach generalizes to both diamagnetic and paramagnetic systems and the limitations expected for very small or ferromagnetically ordered nanoparticles are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Challenges in predicting positron annihilation lifetimes in lead halide perovskites: correlation functionals and polymorphism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kajal Madaan, Guido Roma, Jasurbek Gulomov, Pascal Pochet, Catherine Corbel, Ilja Makkonen</p>
            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected. In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes. In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.</p>
