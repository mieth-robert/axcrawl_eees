            <h2>Scaling Properties of Avalanche Activity in the Two-Dimensional Abelian Sandpile Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anubhav Ganguly</p>
            <p>We study the scaling properties of avalanche activity in the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model. Instead of the conventional avalanche size distribution, we analyze the site activity distribution, which measures how often a site participates in avalanches when grains are added across the lattice. Using numerical simulations for system sizes up to \(L = 160\), averaged over \(10^4\) configurations, we determine the probability distribution \(P(A, L)\) of site activities. The results show that \(P(A, L)\) follows a finite-size scaling form \[ P(A, L) \sim L^{-2} F\Big(\frac{A}{L^2}\Big). \] For small values \(A \ll L^2\) the scaling function behaves as \[ F(u) \sim u^{-1/2}, \quad \text{corresponding to} \quad P(A) \sim \frac{1}{L}, \] while for large activities \(A \sim O(L^2)\) the distribution decays as \[ F(u) \sim \exp\big(-c_3 u - c_4 u^2\big). \] The crossover between these two regimes occurs at \[ A^* \sim 0.1 \, L^2, \] marking the threshold between typical and highly excitable sites. This characterization of local avalanche activity provides complementary information to the usual avalanche size statistics, highlighting how local regions serve as frequent conduits for critical dynamics. These results may help connect sandpile models to real-world self-organized critical systems where only partial local activity can be observed.</p>

            <h2>Conformal Data for the O(3) Wilson-Fisher CFT from Fuzzy Sphere Realization of Quantum Rotor Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjun Dey, Loic Herviou, Christopher Mudry, Andreas Martin Läuchli</p>
            <p>We present a model for strongly interacting fermions with internal O(3) symmetry on the fuzzy-sphere that (i) preserves the rotational symmetry of the fuzzy sphere and (ii) undergoes a quantum phase transition in the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we locate the quantum critical point via conformal perturbation theory and obtain scaling dimensions from finite-size spectra. We identify 24 primary operators and determine some of their operator product expansion coefficients through first-order conformal perturbation theory. The results are benchmarked against conformal bootstrap and large quantum-number expansions and reveal a weakly irrelevant operator that plays a role in dimerized antiferromagnets. Our work establishes the fuzzy sphere as a general framework for quantitatively accessing conformal data in non-Abelian conformal field theories (CFTs).</p>

            <h2>Emergent Network of Josephson Junctions in a Kagome Superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tycho J. Blom, Matthijs Rog, Marieke Altena, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Chuan Li, Kaveh Lahabi</p>
            <p>Materials with a Kagome lattice are intensely studied because they host novel, exotic states that combine strong correlations and electronic topology. The AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) group, in particular, is of major interest due to its combination of charge density waves, unconventional superconductivity, and indications of time-reversal symmetry breaking and electronic nematicity. Recently, critical current oscillations in an external magnetic field were observed in an unstructured flake of CsV3Sb5 at low current densities. In this work, we unequivocally show that the origin of these oscillations is a network of Josephson junctions intrinsic to the flake that emerges below its critical temperature. Under radio-frequency radiation, we observe perfectly quantized, integer Shapiro steps. The sensitivity of the step height to the contact placement indicates a rich and complex network of junctions. By performing interference studies along multiple field directions, we demonstrate that the observed interference effects are a result of geometrically small junctions and filamentary supercurrent flow. Upon microstructuring the flake, prominent features of the interference pattern are fully preserved, illustrating the localized nature of these flakes and their stability to thermal cycles. These results pave the way for determining the exact nature of superconductivity in the AV3Sb5 family.</p>

            <h2>Thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan T. McCourt, John Chiles, Chun-Chia Chen, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Tanaguchi, Francois Amet, Gleb Finkelstein</p>
            <p>The interfaces of quantum Hall insulators with superconductors have emerged as a promising platform to realise interesting physics that may be relevant for topologically protected quantum computing. However, these interfaces can host other effects which obscure the detection of the desired excitations. Here we present measurements of the thermoelectric effect at the quantum Hall-superconductor interface. We explain the heat transport by considering the formation of a hotspot at the interface, which results in a non-equilibrium distribution of electrons that can propagate across the superconductor through vortex cores. The observed thermoelectric effect results in a voltage which changes sign on quantum Hall plateaus and responds to the rearrangement of vortices in the wire. These observations highlight the complex interplay of thermal and charge phenomena at the quantum Hall -- superconductor interfaces and should be considered when interpreting transport measurements in similar systems.</p>

            <h2>Stable High-Order Vortices in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Feng Zhang, Huan-Bo Luo, Josep Batle, Bin Liu, Yongyao Li</p>
            <p>The present contribution explores phase transitions that occur in the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) under the action of gradient magnetic fields. By solving the corresponding linearized system in an exact fashion, we identify the conditions under which the GS phase transitions occur, thus transforming excited states into GS. The study of the full nonlinear system, including both density-density and spin-spin interactions, is numerically analyzed. For the case of repulsive spin-spin interactions, the results resemble the linear case, while attractive spin-spin interactions lead to the formation of mixed-states near the GS phase-transition points. Additionally, higher-order vortex solitons are found to be stable even in the nonlinear regime. These findings demonstrate that arbitrary winding numbers can be achieved as corresponding to stable GS and thus contributing to the understanding of topological properties in SOC BECs.</p>

            <h2>Raman Digital Twin of Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johnathan Kowalski, Liangbo Liang</p>
            <p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation.</p>

            <h2>Two-dimensional superconducting diode effect in topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soma Nagahama, Yuki Sato, Minoru Kawamura, Ilya Belopolski, Ryutaro Yoshimi, Atsushi Tsukazaki, Naoya Kanazawa, Kei S Takahashi, Masashi Kawasaki, Yoshinori Tokura</p>
            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by the nonreciprocity of Cooper-pair motion with respect to current direction. In three-dimensional (3D) materials, SDE results in a critical current that varies with direction, making the effect distinctly observable: the material exhibits superconductivity in one direction while behaving as a resistive metal in the opposite direction. However, in genuinely two-dimensional (2D) materials, the critical current density is theoretically zero, leaving the manifestation of SDE in the 2D limit an intriguing challenge. Here, we present the observation of SDE in a heterostructure composed of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and the iron based superconductor Fe(Se,Te) $-$a candidate for topological superconductor$-$ where superconductivity is confined to the 2D limit. The observed I-V characteristics reveal nonreciprocity in the vortex-creep regime, where finite voltages arise due to the two-dimensional nature of superconductivity. Furthermore, our 2D film demonstrates abrupt voltage jumps, influenced by both the current flow direction and the transverse magnetic field direction. This behavior resembles that of 3D materials but, in this case, is driven by the vortex-flow instability, as illustrated by voltage controlled S-shaped I-V curves. These results underscore the pivotal role of vortex dynamics in SDE and provide new insights into the interplay between symmetry breaking and two-dimensionality in topological insulator/superconductor systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum many-body analysis of a spin-2 bosons with two-body inelastic decay</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeshi Takahashi, Hiroki Saito</p>
            <p>Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of $^{87}\textrm{Rb}$ atoms with a hyperfine spin of 2 are open quantum systems, where the atoms are lost through two-body inelastic collisions. In this dissipation process, a collision channel with total spin of 4 is forbidden by angular momentum conservation, which results in magnetization of the atoms remaining in the condensate. Here, we investigate the quantum many-body properties of spin-2 bosons that undergo two-body atomic loss. We show that the system finally reaches a steady state, which is a mixture of the states with maximum total spins. In addition, we find that a non-classical steady state can be obtained by quenching the quadratic Zeeman coefficient.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum Systems: Coupling Single-Molecule Magnet Qudits with Industrial Silicon Spin Qubits</h2>

            <p>Molecular spin qudits offer an attractive platform for quantum memory, combining long coherence times with rich multi-level spin structures. Terbium bis(phthalocyaninato) (TbPc$_2$) exemplifies such systems, with demonstrated quantum control and chemical reproducibility. In hybrid quantum architectures, TbPc$_2$ can act as the primary memory element, with semiconductor qubits providing scalable readout and coupling. Here we present a step toward such a hybrid system: using an industrially manufactured silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) spin qubit to detect electronic spin transitions of an ensemble of TbPc$_2$ molecules. The readout is based on a compact and robust protocol that applies a microwave pulse while all gate voltages defining the qubit are held at a fixed operating point. This protocol, which combines simultaneous Rapid adiabatic Passage and Spin- Selective tunneling (RPSS), enables high-contrast resonance detection and avoids repeated $\pi$-pulse recalibration common in decoupling schemes. By demonstrating ensemble detection, we establish a foundation for integrating molecular quantum memories with industrial qubit platforms and mark an important step toward single-molecule hybrid quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Manipulating the metal-insulator transitions in correlated vanadium dioxide through bandwidth and band-filling control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaohui Yao, Jiahui Ji, Xuanchi Zhou</p>
            <p>The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in correlated oxide systems opens up a new paradigm to trigger the abruption in multiple physical functionalities, enabling the possibility in unlocking exotic quantum states beyond conventional phase diagram. Nevertheless, the critical challenge for practical device implementation lies in achieving the precise control over the MIT behavior of correlated system across a broad temperature range, ensuring the operational adaptability in diverse environments. Herein, correlated vanadium dioxide (VO2) serves as a model system to demonstrate effective modulations on the MIT functionality through bandwidth and band-filling control. Leveraging the lattice mismatching between RuO2 buffer layer and TiO2 substrate, the in-plane tensile strain states in VO2 films can be continuously adjusted by simply altering the thickness of buffer layer, leading to a tunable MIT property over a wide range exceeding 20 K. Beyond that, proton evolution is unveiled to drive the structural transformation of VO2, with a pronounced strain dependence, which is accompanied by hydrogenation-triggered collective carrier delocalization through hydrogen-related band filling in t2g band. The present work establishes an enticing platform for tailoring the MIT properties in correlated electron systems, paving the way for the rational design in exotic electronic phases and physical phenomena.</p>

Our study demonstrates that for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field orientations critical current density exhibits a strong pinning regime in intermediate fields across the entire temperature range. The dominant contribution to pinning originates from oxygen-to-fluorine substitutional defects, oxygen vacancies, which all act as point defects via a quasiparticle mean free path fluctuation mechanism.

            <h2>Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy on the Kagome Magnet MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riju Pal, Kakan Deb, Nitesh Kumar, Bernd Büchner, Alexey Alfonsov, Vladislav Kataev</p>
            <p>MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is the itinerant ferromagnet on the kagome lattice with high ordering temperature featuring complex electronic properties due to the nontrivial topological electronic band structure, where the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) plays a crucial role. Here, we report a detailed ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopic study of MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ aimed to elucidate and quantify the intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy that is responsible for the alignment of the Mn magnetic moments in the kagome plane. By analyzing the frequency, magnetic field, and temperature dependences of the FMR modes, we have quantified the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density that reaches the value of approximately $ 3.5\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 3$ K and reduces to about $1\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 300$ K. The revealed significantly strong magnetic anisotropy suggests a sizable contribution of the orbital magnetic moment to the spin magnetic moment of Mn, supporting the scenario of the essential role of SOC for the nontrivial electronic properties of MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heng Wu, Houssam el Mrabet Haje, Michiel Dubbelman, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, Mazhar N. Ali, Yaojia Wang</p>
            <p>Superconductivity represents a macroscopic quantum state notable for its rich manifestations of electronic coherence and collective behavior. Kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A= K, Cs, Rb) possess cascade intertwined quantum phases including superconductivity, symmetry-breaking charge orders, nematic orders and topological states, making them attractive materials for exploring exotic superconducting states. However, the superconducting properties and the Cooper pairing behaviors have not been fully explored and understood. In this work, by studying both the magnetoresistance and critical current behaviors in KV3Sb5 ring and pristine flakes, we reveal the charge 2e paring in KV3Sb5 although anomalous oscillations with smaller periodicity were observed, and report the intrinsic superconducting phase coherence in KV3Sb5 flakes. The former is demonstrated by the careful verification of the Little-Parks oscillations in differential resistance colormaps, and the latter indicates the existence of superconducting domains in KV3Sb5. Moreover, we observed a special phenomenon: the transfer of supercurrent interference patterns between the superconducting ring and the superconducting flake, which demonstrates the global critical current effect of the superconducting phase coherence. These findings provide new insights into the Cooper pairing behaviors in KV3Sb5 and highlight the importance of global effect of superconducting phase coherence in the understanding of the superconducting behaviors.</p>

            <p>Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5 experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized superconductor with increased B||.</p>

            <p>The pair-density-wave (PDW) exhibits periodic amplitude and sign modulations of the superconducting order parameter. Such a pairing state has been proposed to be sensitive to nonmagnetic scattering. In this work, we observe the nonmagnetic PDW-breaking effect in a kagome superconductor, using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe 2x2 PDW induced by the coupling between charge order and superconductivity. The global PDW is substantially suppressed upon doping the kagome lattice with dilute isovalent nonmagnetic impurities, whereas the charge order and uniform superconductivity remain robust. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that PDW is distinctly suppressed near dopants. We attribute the PDW suppression to a nonmagnetic PDW breaking effect, arising from phase sign modulation of PDW in the kagome d-orbital hosting Bogoliubov Fermi states.</p>

            <h2>Entropy Engineering-Regulated Electron-Phonon Coupling for Highly Efficient Photoluminescence in Se-doped WS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Zhang, Quan Shen, Mengmeng Zhang, Zhiming Deng, Taishen Wu, Xuying Zhong, Gang Ouyang, Dongsheng Tang, Qi Zheng, Jiansheng Dong, Weichang Zhou</p>
            <p>The limited quantum yield of strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides grown by vapor-phase methods and during transfer-based stacking poses a fundamental challenge for their optoelectronic applications. Here, we introduce the concept of "entropy engineering" as a transformative strategy to selectively enhance light-matter interactions through controlled electron-phonon coupling. We unveil how tailored entropy introduced via precise selenium doping or interfacial van der Waals proximity can significantly amplify radiative recombination from momentum-dark excitons in WS2 monolayers. Notably, we discover that slight selenium doping drastically enhances the photoluminescence (PL) of WS2 under strain. While both undoped and heavily doped WS2 suffer from strong PL quenching owing to the direct-to-indirect bandgap transition, lightly Se-doped samples exhibit an order-of-magnitude increase in emission intensity. This counterintuitive boost is traced to doping-induced structural disorder, which intensifies electron-phonon interactions and unlocks efficient phonon-assisted emission from otherwise non-radiative indirect excitons. Moreover, we demonstrate that van der Waals coupling to adjacent Se-doped layers can impart interfacial entropy and further augment PL via proximity effects. Our work highlights entropy engineering via controlled doping as a powerful strategy for activating high-efficiency light emission in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Local-Antisymmetric Flat Band and Coexisting Correlated stripe charge orders in WSe2-Modulated Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi Zhang, Shihao Zhang, Mengmeng Zhang, Lin He, Qi Zheng</p>
            <p>Insulating, atomically flat transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like WSe2 are ideal substrates for probing intrinsic graphene properties. Conventionally, their influence on graphene's band structure is assumed negligible, particularly when small moire patterns form. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the atomic registry in graphene/WSe2 heterostructures profoundly modulates the electronic structure of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). At special graphene/WSe2 twist angles, an incommensurate moire superlattice hosts three distinct atomic stacking configurations (A, B, X types). These induce position-dependent potentials that asymmetrically shift MATBG's flat bands, transforming them from hole-side to electron-side asymmetric within a single AA-stacked region. This symmetry breaking enables the unprecedented coexistence of orthogonal stripe charge orders in the correlated regime-a phenomenon previously considered mutually exclusive due to Coulomb repulsion. This band modulation arises from the synergistic effects of the graphene/WSe2 interfacial atomic registry and heterostrain within the MATBG, exhibiting multi-field tunability. Our work establishes interfacial atomic registry as a critical, previously overlooked tuning parameter for flat-band physics, opening avenues to engineer correlated quantum states in van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masafumi Udagawa, Roderich Moessner</p>
            <p>Fractional excitations provide a key to identifying sought-after topological quantum spin liquid states in realistic materials. Their single-particle dynamics already presents a challenging many-body problem on account of the coupling to their emergent gauge field. Here, we study the spinon excitations of kagome ice, realized at the $2/3$ magnetization plateau of spin ice, by combining up-to-$63$-site exact diagonalization with an analytical state graph mapping. We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging. We explicitly construct, and count, the concomitant many-body wave functions. Finally, we discuss the possible role of these flat modes in the magnetization process of kagome antiferromagnets, in particular with regard to the asymmetric termination of the kagome ice magnetisation plateau.</p>

            <p>The structures of the superconducting spin valve (SSV) Fe/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Pb/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Fe (where Si$_3$N$_4$ is a dielectric insulating layer of controlled thickness) were investigated. The dependence of the magnitude of the SSV effect on the thicknesses of the superconducting (S) and insulating (I) layers was studied. Optimization of the S and I layer thicknesses enabled a complete switching between the normal and superconducting states when the mutual orientation of the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic (F) layers changed from antiparallel to parallel. A maximal SSV effect value of 0.36\,K was achieved in an external magnetic field of 1\,kOe. These results demonstrate that SSV structures with tunable S/F interface transparency controlled by insulating interlayers are promising for achieving a significant magnitude of the effect.

            <h2>Behavior of passive polymeric tracers of different topologies in a dilute bath of active Brownian particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramanand Singh Yadav, Ralf Metzler, Rajarshi Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>Using computer simulations in two dimensions we investigate the dynamics and structure of passive polymeric tracer with different topologies immersed in a low-density active particle bath. One of the key observations is that polymer exhibit faster dynamics compared to passive colloidal particles at high activity, for the same particle density, in both linear and star polymer topologies. This enhanced motion is attributed to the accumulation of active particles, which induces prolonged and persistent movement of the polymer. Further analysis reveals that star polymers exhibit more complex and intriguing behavior than their linear counterparts. Notably, the accumulation of active particles promotes the pairing of arms in star polymers. For instance, a three-armed star polymer adopts a conformation similar to a linear polymer with two-arms due to this pairing as a result, at high activity, the dynamics of both the polymers converge. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a linear polymer with the same total number of beads as the star polymer. Interestingly, at high activity -- where arm pairing in the star polymer is significant -- the star polymer demonstrates faster dynamics than the linear polymer, despite having the identical number of beads. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interactions between active and passive components of varying topologies in dilute systems and highlight their potential for innovative applications ranging from materials science to biomedicine.</p>

            <h2>One-dimensional topological superconductors with nonsymmorphic symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Tymczyszyn, Edward McCann</p>
            <p>We present example four-band Hermitian tight-binding Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians and Kramer's degenerate Hamiltonians in one dimension. Starting from a generalized Rice-Mele model, we incorporate superconducting terms to obtain a four-band BdG Hamiltonian with intrinsic charge-conjugation symmetry, and constrain it using symmorphic or nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetries. In position space we find that each form of time-reversal symmetry, when applied to random BdG matrices, results in a unique block diagonalization of the Hamiltonian when translational symmetry is also enforced. We provide representative models in all relevant symmorphic symmetry classes, including the non-superconducting CII class. For nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetry, we identify a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index with two phases supporting Majorana zero modes and two without, and study disorder effects in the presence of topological solitons. We further generalize a winding-number method, previously applied only to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants without Kramer's degeneracy, to compute indices for both the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ model and a non-superconducting AII model with nonsymmorphic chiral symmetry and Kramer's degeneracy. We propose topolectric circuit implementations of the charge-density-wave and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ models which agree with the topological calculations. Finally, we show that, in one dimension, nonsymmorphic unitary symmetries do not produce new topological classifications beyond $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices.</p>

            <p>Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport, and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnet superconductor hybrids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, Tero T. Heikkilä, F. Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We study the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in superconducting altermagnets and superconductor altermagnet hybrids by computing the alternating spin current and edge the spin density in the presence of an alternating electric field. We show that while in the normal state the effect is not sensitive to the field frequency, in the superconducting state, there is a strong effect for frequencies on the scale of $\Delta_0$ or lower. We contrast the effect to the spin accumulation induced by the spin-Hall effect, by showing that for the altermagnet spin-splitter effect the out-of-phase spin density does not diverge in the adiabatic limit. This difference is attributed to the absence of any equilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnets. In fact, the out-of-phase component vanishes below the gap excitation frequency $2\Delta_0$, because below this frequency the absence of dissipation and the behavior of the system under time-reversal directly determine the relative phase between the charge current, spin current, and spin accumulation. The nonequilibrium effect can be tuned by external parameters like temperature. In fact, it has a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, taking its largest value for temperatures around $0.8T_{c}$. The value at this temperature can be significantly larger than the normal state spin density or the low temperature spin density. Thus, besides using the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect to identify altermagnets, its tunability makes it also suitable for applications.</p>

            <p>Dodecagonal oxide quasicrystals (OQCs) have so far been limited to a few elemental systems, with no general formation mechanism established. Here, we demonstrate a versatile approach to OQC formation via a host-atom-induced transformation of a metal-oxide honeycomb (HC) network. Adsorption of Ba, Sr, or Eu onto the HC layer triggers its reorganization into a dodecagonal tiling, as revealed by low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. Full conversion occurs when 73% of the honeycomb rings are occupied. Kelvin probe and UV photoelectron spectroscopy show a linear decrease in work function with increasing host coverage, followed by a sharp increase upon quasicrystal formation due to reduced host dipoles. This transformation mechanism enables the fabrication of structurally precise OQCs, including a new Eu-Ti-O phase that extends the field to lanthanide quasicrystals, forming a 2D grid of localized magnetic moments. The method offers a general route to explore lattice-matched substrates for epitaxial growth and may be adapted to other 2D honeycomb materials - such as graphene, hexagonal ice, and silica - paving the way for engineered aperiodic systems beyond transition metal oxides.</p>

            <h2>A minimal and universal representation of fermionic wavefunctions (fermions = bosons + one)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Fu</p>
            <p>Representing fermionic wavefunctions efficiently is a central problem in quantum physics, chemistry and materials science. In this work, we introduce a universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space. Building on this lifting, we obtain a \emph{parity-graded representation} of fermionic wavefunctions, expressed in terms of symmetric feature variables that encode particle configuration and antisymmetric feature variables that encode exchange statistics. This representation is both exact and minimal: the number of required features scales as $D\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\sim N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network solvers for many-electron systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Partha Sarathi Banerjee, Rahul Marathe, Sankalpa Ghosh</p>
            <p>A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra- and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.</p>

            <h2>Nonanaliticities and ergodicity breaking in noninteracting many-body dynamics via stochastic resetting and global measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Soldner, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto</p>
            <p>Stochastic resetting generates nonequilibrium steady states by interspersing unitary quantum dynamics with resets at random times. When the state to which the system is reset is chosen conditionally on the outcome of a global and spatially resolved measurement, the steady state can feature collective behavior similar to what is typically observed at phase transitions. Here we investigate such conditional reset protocol in a system of noninteracting spins, where the reset state is chosen as a magnetization eigenstate, that is selected (conditioned) on the outcome of a previous magnetization measurement. The stationary states that emerge from this protocol are characterized by the density of spins in a given magnetization eigenstate, which is the analogue of the order parameter. The resulting stationary phase diagram features multiple nonanalytic points. They are of first-order type for half-integer spin, while multicritical behavior, signalled by both first and second-order discontinuities, is found for integer spin. We also show that the associated dynamics is nonergodic, i.e., which stationary state the system ultimately assumes is determined be the initial state. Interestingly, the mechanism underlying these phenomena does not rely on interactions, but the emergent nonlinear behavior is solely a consequence of correlations induced by the measurement.</p>

            <h2>Efficient and accurate tensor network algorithm for Anderson impurity problems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijie Sun, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo</p>
            <p>The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics to study strongly correlated effects. However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic density-functional theory study of the effects of strain on the structural and electronic properties in vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), with particular emphasis on its effect on the relative stability of the metallic rutile and the insulating monoclinic M1 phases.

Our calculations confirm the dominant role of $c$ axis strain, i.e., along the direction of the V-V dimerization in the M1 phase. Our analysis suggests that this effect stems primarily from the weakening of the lattice stiffness, with the hopping along the $c$ axis playing a minor role. We also confirm that, in strain scenarios that deform the basal plane, the $c$ axis strain still has a dominant effect on the phase stability.</p>

            <p>The $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain is a paradigmatic quantum system hosting exotic excitations such as spinons and solitons, and forming random singlet state in the presence of quenched disorder. Realizing and distinguishing these excitations in a single material remains a significant challenge. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a high-quality single crystal of copper benzoate, we identify and characterize all three excitation types by tuning the magnetic field at ultra-low temperatures. At a low field of 0.2 T, a temperature-independent spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) over more than a decade confirms the presence of spinons. Below 0.4 K, an additional relaxation channel emerges, characterized by $1/T_1 \propto T$ and a spectral weight growing as $-\ln(T/T_0)$, signaling a random-singlet ground state induced by weak quenched disorder. At fields above 0.5 T, a field-induced spin gap $\Delta \propto H^{2/3}$ observed in both $1/T_1$ and the Knight shift signifies soliton excitations. Our results establish copper benzoate as a unique experimental platform for studying one-dimensional quantum integrability and the interplay of disorder and correlations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Navdeep Rana, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>We extensively study the phenomenology of one dimensional Nonreciprocal Cahn Hilliard model for varying nonreciprocity $(\alpha)$ and different boundary conditions. At small $\alpha$, a perturbed uniform state evolves to a defect laden configuration that lacks global polar order. Defects are the sources and sinks of travelling waves and nonreciprocity selects defects with a unique wave number that increases monotonically with $\alpha_c$. A critical threshold $\alpha_c$ marks the onset of a transition to states with finite global polar order. For periodic boundaries, above $\alpha_c$, the system shows travelling waves that are completely ordered. In contrast, travelling waves are incompatible with Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries. Instead, for $\alpha \gtrsim \alpha_c$, we find fluctuating domains that show intermittent polar order and at large $\alpha$, the system partitions into two domains with opposite polar order.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent work that mapped the low-temperature properties of a class of frustrated spin $S=1$ kagome antiferromagnets with competing exchange and single-ion anisotropies to the fully-packed limit (with each vertex touched by exactly one dimer or nontrivial loop) of a system of dimers and nontrivial (length $s > 2$) loops on the honeycomb lattice, we study this fully-packed dimer-loop model on the three-dimensional bipartite cubic and diamond lattices as a function of $w$, the relative fugacity of dimers. We find that the $w \rightarrow 0$ O($1$) loop-model limit is separated from the $w \rightarrow \infty$ dimer limit by a geometric phase transition at a nonzero finite critical fugacity $w_c$: The $w>w_c$ phase has short loops with an exponentially decaying loop-size distribution, while the $w<w_c$ phase is dominated by large loops whose loop-size distribution is governed by universal properties of the critical O($1$) loop soup. This transition separates two {\em distinct} Coulomb liquid phases of the system: Both phases admit a description in terms of a fluctuating divergence-free polarization field $P_{\mu}(\mathbf{r})$ on links of the lattice and are characterized by dipolar correlations at long distances. The transition at $w_c$ is a flux confinement-deconfinement transition. Equivalently, and independent of boundary conditions, half-integer test charges $q=\pm 1/2$ are confined for $w>w_c$, but become deconfined in the small-$w$ phase. Although both phases are unstable to a nonzero fugacity for the charge $\pm 1/2$ excitations, the destruction of the $w >w_c$ Coulomb liquid is characterized by an interesting slow crossover, since test charges with $q=\pm 1/2$ are confined in this phase.</p>

            <p>Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in two-dimensional materials are highly promising candidates for quantum technologies. SPEs in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been widely investigated, but mostly in exfoliated or powder samples that require an activation process, making it difficult to compare studies and reproduce results. Here, we address this problem and propose a platform based on large-area metaloraganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown hBN, which combines reproducibility and scalability with the ability to readily host SPEs without activation. Through the creation of bubbles via electron-beam irradiation, we achieve additional functionalities, including an interference-mediated enhancement of emission by approximately 100-200\%, dedicated structures that allow the relocation of individual emitters across different systems, and the opportunity to investigate strain-induced effects. Moreover, in contrast to other gas-filled bubbles that deflate at low temperatures, our bubbles remain stable under cryogenic conditions, allowing studies as a function of temperature. To improve the control over the shape and position of bubbles, we demonstrate a~mask-based method that enables deterministic control over bubble formation. The presented hBN bubbles constitute a versatile platform for reproducible studies of hBN-based emitters, providing a reliable insight into their nature and properties.</p>

            <p>Multiferroic materials, in which electric polarization and magnetic order coexist and couple, offer rich opportunities for both fundamental discovery and technology. However, multiferroicity remains rare due to conflicting electronic requirements for ferroelectricity and magnetism. One route to circumvent this challenge is to exploit the noncollinear ordering of spin cycloids, whose symmetry permits the emergence of polar order. In this work, we introduce another pathway to multiferroic order in which strain generates polarization in materials that host nonpolar spin spirals. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we chose the spin spiral in the well-studied helimagnet Cr1/3NbS2. To detect the induced polarization, we introduce the technique of magnetoelectric birefringence (MEB), an optical probe that enables spatially-resolved and unambiguous detection of polar order. By combining MEB imaging with strain engineering, we confirm the onset of a polar vector at the magnetic transition, establishing strained Cr1/3NbS2 as a type-II multiferroic.</p>

            <p>We investigate the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition in coherently (Rabi) coupled Bose-Einstein condensates at zero and finite temperatures, exploring different routes to the transition by tuning the Rabi coupling or increasing the temperature at a fixed coupling. Using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory within the Popov approximation, we map out the finite-temperature phase diagram of a three-dimensional homogeneous condensate and identify the critical line through the softening of the spin gap. Magnetization and the spin dispersion branch reveal the progressive suppression of the ferromagnetic order with increasing temperature. In quasi-one-dimensional harmonic traps, the transition, driven by Rabi coupling, is inferred through the softening of the spin breathing mode with its minimum shifting to lower coupling values with increasing temperature. Notably, the thermally driven transition causes monotonic hardening of all the spin modes. For both coupling and temperature-driven transition, the hybridized density modes in the ferromagnetic phase acquire more density character while approaching the critical point.</p>

            <p>The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms. Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum 'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp transition at T* {\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral density S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-{\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at {\alpha} {\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T) undergoes a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin noise, with S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer match to data.</p>

            <p>We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</p>

We show theoretically, and confirm using tilt angle experiments of droplets on liquid-like surfaces, the dependence of the coefficient of droplet-on-solid kinetic friction on system parameters. We also show that a molecular kinetic-type model can describe the observed non-linear velocity-force relationship. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the relationship between droplet-on-solid friction, and wettability and liquid adhesion.</p>

            <p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.</p>

            <h2>A physics-aware deep learning model for shear band formation around collapsing pores in shocked reactive materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinlun Cheng, Bingzhe Chen, Joseph Choi, Yen T. Nguyen, Pradeep Seshadri, Mayank Verma, H. S. Udaykumar, Stephen Baek</p>
            <p>Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts. These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation tools for reactive materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeffrey Z. Song, Gilad Kishony, Erez Berg, Mark S. Rudner</p>
            <p>We introduce a variational approach for preparing low energy states of arbitrary target Hamiltonians. The protocol is defined in terms of a repeated cycle consisting of p layers of unitary gates applied to the system and ancilla "bath" qubits, followed by reset of the bath qubits. The gate parameters within each cycle are optimized such that the steady state achieved after many cycles has a low energy expectation value with respect to the target Hamiltonian, and that the energy converges toward the steady state value in as few cycles as possible. We illustrate the protocol for the transverse field Ising model, and study its systematic behaviors with respect to system size, model parameters, and noise using tensor network based classical simulations. We then experimentally demonstrate its operation on IBM's ibm_kingston quantum processor for up to 28 system qubits coupled to 14 bath sites. Classical training on small system sizes and with few unitary layers per cycle gives robust results that transfer well to larger system sizes and to noisy hardware.</p>

            <p>Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is capable of combining temperature information from different molecular simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan London, Mohammad R. Momeni</p>
            <p>Feynman path integrals (PIs) have found many uses in approximate quantum dynamics methods that are able to efficiently calculate real-time quantum correlation functions. The PIs typically take the form of discrete imaginary time slices over a closed path, where the slices form the ``beads'' of a ring polymer (RP) necklace. Some methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), use the RP to generate an effective potential for the dynamics, while others, like RP molecular dynamics (RPMD), directly utilize the RP in real-time dynamics in order to incorporate quantum effects. The standard, discretized bead forms of CMD and RPMD can require a large number of RP beads to provide accurate results for systems where quantum effects are strong, such as at low temperatures. In Paper I, we introduced the bead-Fourier (BF) CMD method, where we utilized the inclusion of a Fourier sine series to reduce the number of beads needed to converge the CMD effective potential up to eightfold. In this work, we extend RPMD to incorporate BF-PIs in the form of BF-RPMD. We study a number of different implementations of the method through the calculation of correlation functions for both linear and non-linear operators. The effectiveness of the BF-RPMD method is sensitive to both the system and form of the operators being studied, but we show that this method is able to produce results on par with standard RPMD, with at worst twofold and up to eightfold reduction in the number of beads by including two to three Fourier components.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiran Bai, Feng Xiong, Xueheng Kuang</p>
            <p>Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on quantum computers.</p>

            <p>The use of a Si pixel-based particle tracking scheme in muSR will, among others, allow measurements using a ten-fold increased stopped muons rate and samples ten times smaller than currently possible. Here we present simulation results to assess the effects of magnetic fields on two spectrometer configurations using a two-layered tracking scheme for the incoming and outgoing particles. At a low magnetic field of up to ~50 mT, the tracking and reconstruction accuracy is only minimally influenced. Beyond a magnetic field of ~80 mT the tracking capabilities diminish significantly. Operating a two-layered scheme using small magnetic fields hence does not require adaptations. Only at large magnetic fields, a tracking scheme that makes use of an accurate field map or the use of at least three layers must be employed to achieve reliable particle tracking.</p>

            <p>This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven methodology for predicting a combination of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms are compared with the deep learning (DL) model. The developed models are tested using k-fold validation. Nine different input-output feature configurations are evaluated to assess the model performance. The input-output feature comprises material properties, namely, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and molecular mass of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials obtained from literature and the strength parameter (average Von Mises Stress (VMS)) estimated from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation for joint assembly structure. A multi-output model, Autoencoder (AE), has also been developed and tested to predict various features. The ML model, namely the polynomial regression (PR), outperforms the other ML/DL models with a Mean square Error (MSE) of 0.01 for the test data. The autoencoder model with a 32-16-32 structure outperforms LR, PR, RF, and ANN with an MSE of 0.04% for the prediction of unseen data. The developed multi-output model accurately predicts all the features (single and multiple), while PR fails to accurately predict multi-output features of low importance. The developed AE model predicts the different material properties with an average error of ~0.16-3.78% with literature-reported values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Jaiswal, Ivar S. Haugerud, Hidde D. Vuijk, Christoph A. Weber</p>
            <p>Life relies on a sophisticated metabolic molecular machinery that turns over high-energy molecules to evolve complex macromolecules and assemblies. At the molecular origin of life, such machinery was absent, implying the need for simple yet robust physical mechanisms to harvest energy from the environment and perform chemical work or produce chemical power. However, the mechanisms involved in harvesting energy from a macroscopic cyclic environment to drive chemical processes on the molecular scale remain elusive. In this work, we propose a theory that describes the kinetics of chemical reactions in a system subject to a cyclic reservoir with varying properties. We compare cycles of solvent (wet-dry cycles), with cycles of a component participating in a chemical reaction (reactant cycle). We find that for both wet-dry and reactant cycles, resonance frequencies exist at which the chemical power is maximal. We identify which cycle type is more beneficial in harvesting chemical power for different molecular interactions. Our findings of harvest efficiencies around ten percent suggest that the cyclic environment could have played a key role in catalyzing the metabolic molecular machinery at the molecular origin of life.</p>

            <h2>Depth One Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz as an Approximate Gibbs Distribution Sampler</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske</p>
            <p>This study numerically investigates the thermal sampling properties of QAOA, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz which was generalized from the original Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Specifically, the ability of QAOA to sample from the Gibbs distribution, equivalently the Boltzmann distribution, defined by a classical Ising model, specifically a fully connected disordered spin glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) model. We focus on two different QAOA mixers; the standard transverse field X mixer, and the Grover mixer. At a QAOA depth of one we examine, for a single full QAOA parameter search space period, the energy landscape, the Shannon entropy landscape of the QAOA probability distribution, and the tradeoff between Boltzmann distribution sampling temperature and error rate (how close to the true Boltzmann distribution is the QAOA distribution). We find that at very high temperatures one-round Grover mixer QAOA can sample from the Boltzmann distribution more accurately than the standard X mixer QAOA at one round. Both X mixer and Grover mixer depth one QAOA can serve as approximate Boltzmann distribution samplers, and how good this approximation is depends heavily on the QAOA angle choice.</p>

            <p>Charged water drops are more widespread than commonly acknowledged. For example, raindrops typically carry charges of order Q ~ 1 pC, while routine pipetting in the laboratory produces drops with Q ~ 50 pC. Here, we show that such modest charging can spontaneously generate periodic Coulomb fissions for evaporating water drops on lubricated surfaces, with more than 60 successive cycles observed over 30 min. Interestingly, the underlying instability can be quantitatively predicted by two fissility thresholds: one marking the onset of drop elongation and another triggering fission. Each fission culminates with a fine liquid jet that disintegrates into 40-50 microdroplets, expelled within microseconds. The phenomenon spans an extraordinary range of length scales (from millimetres to microns) and time scales (hour to microseconds), with broad potential applications ranging from nanoscale fabrication to electrospray ionization.</p>

            <p>The significance of small-scale forcing of particles on the carrier two-dimensional turbulent flow has been shown [Pandey, Perlekar, and Mitra, Phys. Rev. E, 100, 013114 (2019)] to influence the spectral scaling properties of the carrier fluid. We investigate possible consequences of such two-way coupling in a turbulent suspension of inertial particles in one and two-point Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics. In particular, we find signatures of a possibly enhanced intermittency in the vorticity distributions. We characterize the changes in the (small-scale) geometry of the flow via the Okubo-Weiss parameter. Finally, we examine the scaling properties of the second-order (vorticity) structure functions and find a non-trivial form of scale-invariance at finite mass-loading. This suggests that a dual-scale forcing mechanism on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation may be an effective model to mimic the role of particle feedback in turbulence.</p>

            <h2>Uniformity Bias in Ground-State Sampling Induced by Replica Alignment in Quantum Monte Carlo for Quantum Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naoki Maruyama, Masayuki Ohzeki, Kazuyuki Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing (QA) with a transverse field often fails to sample degenerate ground states fairly, limiting applicability to problems requiring diverse optimal solutions. Although Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is widely used to simulate QA, its ability to reproduce such unfair ground-state sampling remains unclear because stochastic and coherent quantum dynamics differ fundamentally. We quantitatively evaluate how accurately QMC reproduces the sampling bias in QA by comparing the final ground-state distributions from the QMC master equation and the Schrödinger equation. We find QMC tends to produce uniform ground-state probabilities, unlike QA's biased distribution, and that this uniformity bias strengthens as annealing proceeds. Our analysis reveals that this bias originates from replica alignment -- the dominance of configurations in which all Trotter replicas coincide -- caused by the energetic suppression and entropic reduction of kink configurations (replica mismatches). These findings clarify a fundamental limitation of discrete-time QMC in faithfully simulating QA dynamics, highlighting the importance of replica correlations and transition rules in achieving realistic ground-state sampling.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-Squeezing-Induced Algebraic Non-Hermitian Skin Effects and Ultra Spectral Sensitivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing.</p>

            <p>Quantized neural network training optimizes a discrete, non-differentiable objective. The straight-through estimator (STE) enables backpropagation through surrogate gradients and is widely used. While previous studies have primarily focused on the properties of surrogate gradients and their convergence, the influence of quantization hyperparameters, such as bit width and quantization range, on learning dynamics remains largely unexplored. We theoretically show that in the high-dimensional limit, STE dynamics converge to a deterministic ordinary differential equation. This reveals that STE training exhibits a plateau followed by a sharp drop in generalization error, with plateau length depending on the quantization range. A fixed-point analysis quantifies the asymptotic deviation from the unquantized linear model. We also extend analytical techniques for stochastic gradient descent to nonlinear transformations of weights and inputs.</p>

            <p>Recently a new meteoritic mineral, Zolenskyite (Fe0.99Mn0.04Ca0.01Cr1.99S3.98), was discovered from the Indarch meteorite. Zolenskyite was structurally indexed as the monoclinic C2/m CrNb2Se4 - Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 12.84(1) Å, b = 3.44(1) Å, c = 5.94(1) Å and \b{eta} = 117(1)°. Zolenskyite was reported as high-pressure phase formed from Daubréelite at high pressures and temperatures in highly shocked regions of the EH parent asteroid. Although this discovery provides valuable information about the origin of meteoritic mineral assemblages, the results and conclusions raise controversies with those reported in previous articles where the synthetic FeCr2S4 was described. In this review, an alternative analysis of the supplementary X-ray data from Zolenskyite was made and yields to the monoclinic I2/m Cr3S4 type structure of synthetic FeCr2S4, with unit cell parameters a = 5.940 Å, b = 3.440 Å, c = 11.441 Å and \b{eta} = 90.55°, in agreement with previous results in the literature and differ from those reported above. Regarding the genesis of Zolenskyite and according to solid-state laboratory synthesis, the transformation of cubic FeCr2S4 phase (ideal composition of Daubréelite) to monoclinic FeCr2S4 (ideal composition of Zolenskyite) requires a process whose replication in Shock metamorphism stages is not well established and remains an open issue to address, together with another open issue related to the real composition of meteoritic minerals, with minor and trace metals, which is often overlooked when compared with synthetic ideal compositions. Whatever the results to be obtained by addressing the above open issues, they will shed more light on the genesis of Zolenskyite. In this context, it is worth to promote an open debate about the hypothesis of artificial origin.</p>

            <p>We consider the description of a Fermi gas of free electrons given by the Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation, and aim at providing a precise mathematical understanding of the Fermi ground state and its first-order approximation of excited states on the Fermi sphere. In order to achieve that, using the framework of hydrodynamic limits in collisional kinetic theory, we identify the low-temperature regimes in which charge-density fluctuations concentrate on the Fermi sphere. In three spatial dimensions or higher, we also characterize the thermodynamic equilibra and energy spectra of fluctuations. This allows us to derive the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations describing how charge densities flow and propagate in metals, thereby providing a precise description of plasma oscillations in conductors. The two-dimensional case is fundamentally different and is handled in a companion article. Remarkably, our results establish that excited electrons and their energy can be distributed on the Fermi sphere anisotropically, which deviates from the common intuitive assumption that electrons and their energy should be distributed uniformly in all directions. The hydrodynamic regimes featured in this work are akin to the acoustic limit of the classical Boltzmann equation. However, we emphasize that our derivation holds for arbitrarily fast rates of convergence of the Knudsen number, which significantly extends the applicability of the known proofs of the classical acoustic limit. This suggest that low-temperature limits of Fermi gases provide a promising avenue of research toward a complete understanding of the compressible Euler limit.</p>

            <p>Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) operating at ultralow temperatures serve as promising acoustic platforms for implementing microwave-optical transduction and radio frequency (RF) front-ends in aerospace communications because of the exceptional electromechanical coupling (k^2) and frequency scalability. However, the properties of LWRs at cryogenic temperatures have not been well understood yet. Herein, we experimentally investigate the temperature dependence of the quality factor and resonant frequency in higher order antisymmetric LWRs down to millikelvin temperatures. The high-frequency A1 and A3 mode resonators with spurious-free responses are comprehensively designed, fabricated, and characterized. The quality factors of A1 modes gradually increase upon cryogenic cooling and shows 4 times higher than the room temperature value, while A3 mode resonators exhibit a non-monotonic temperature dependence. Our findings provide new insights into loss mechanisms of cryogenic LWRs, paving the way to strong-coupling quantum acoustodynamics and next-generation satellite wireless communications.</p>

In this work, we investigate intensity correlation functions arising from the interference of resonance fluorescence from a quantum emitter with a coherent laser field. We show that the observed bunching behavior results from a subtle interplay between quantum interference and the normalization of the correlation functions. We show that by adjusting the mixing ratio and phase one can achieve full tunability of the second-order correlation, ranging from anti-bunching to bunching. We further extend our analysis to third-order correlation functions, both experimentally and theoretically, to provide new insights into the interpretation of higher-order correlations and offer practical tools for shaping quantum optical fields.</p>

            <p>Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.</p>

            <p>Diamonds containing color centers have recently gathered significant attention for photonic quantum technologies, including quantum sensing, photonic quantum computers, and quantum networks. Among the various color centers, tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are particularly promising due to the high emission efficiency from the zero-phonon line and due to their long spin coherence times. However, the extraction of photons from diamond remains a key challenge. Here we demonstrate high photon extraction from a single SnV center incorporated in a diamond nanopillar with tapered sidewalls and a multi-cone structure. A sharp emission peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $6\,$nm was observed at a wavelength of $619\,$nm. Furthermore, the second-order correlation function exhibited an antibunching dip well below $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.5$, indicating single-photon emission. Remarkably, the emitter achieved a high saturation count rate of approximately $9\,$Mcps. These results establish our nanopillar platform as a promising candidate for bright and stable quantum sources and sensors based on SnV centers in diamond.</p>

            <p>Photoluminescence (PL) is a ubiquitous proxy for material quality in optoelectronic devices, widely used for high-throughput materials discovery. However, we demonstrate that in the presence of charge-selective contacts, PL loses its predictive reliability and can exhibit strong quenching even in highly efficient photovoltaic devices under open-circuit conditions. By combining steady-state and transient PL with contactless transient surface photovoltage measurements we disentangle the intertwined processes of extraction and recombination, clarifying the physical origin of this phenomenon. This joint approach reveals extraction dynamics not captured by PL alone. A digital replica of the interface shows that Coulomb attraction and interfacial recombination are the fundamental mechanisms driving quenching after charge extraction. Based on these insights, we present a decision tree for heterojunction classification and PL interpretation applicable across diverse optoelectronic systems, including photovoltaics, photodetectors, and LEDs. Our approach supports systematic screening and optimization of half-devices, bridging the gap between accelerated materials discovery and accelerated device discovery.</p>

            <h2>Optimal parallelisation strategies for flat histogram Monte Carlo sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hubert J. Naguszewski, Christopher D. Woodgate, David Quigley</p>
            <p>Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for high throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel efficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl) structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Synchronization of Perturbed Oscillating Coherences</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi J. Zhao, Joel E. Moore, Juzar Thingna, Christopher W. Wächtler</p>
            <p>Synchronization in quantum systems has been recently studied through persistent oscillations of local observables, which stem from undamped modes of the dissipative dynamics. However, the existence of such modes requires fine-tuning the system to satisfy specific symmetry constraints. We investigate the response of spin systems that possess such oscillating modes to generic, weak perturbations. We show that even when these perturbations break the symmetry and lead to a single steady state, the phase correlations in the resulting state exhibit signatures of synchronization. Our results therefore connect the persistent oscillation notion (dynamical) and the notion based on phase correlations (steady-state) of synchronization, which so far have been regarded as distinct phenomena. Furthermore, we demonstrate that steady-state synchronization in these systems can exhibit features that are absent in the dynamical synchronization. Our work suggests robustness of synchronization and points toward a potential unifying framework of quantum synchronization.</p>

            <p>Gauge theories describe the fundamental forces of nature. However, high-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is notoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation offers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly probed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and long-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a high-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the initial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to rapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to long distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be explained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma oscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the way to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate a lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma oscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of predictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework encompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of the plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics of a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum simulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas Ebner, Berndt Müller, Andreas Schäfer, Leonhard Schmotzer, Clemens Seidl, Xiaojun Yao</p>
            <p>We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the initial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is strongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest growth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational basis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime, revealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during thermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for nonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this property generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.R. Shaginyan, A.Z. Msezane, G.S. Japaridze</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that an absolutely flat band retains the superconducting state at $T_c\to 0$. When $T_c>0$ the flat band disappears, since it must be modified by the superconducting state. Thus, a number of the results on ultra-strong coupling superconductivity in flat band considered in the article ("Evidence for Dirac flat band superconductivity enabled by quantum geometry", Nature 614, 440 (2023)) were predicted and explained many years ago. One has to take into account that at $T_c>0$ the flat band distorts, becoming tilted. As a result, the charge carriers' velocity $v_F\propto T_c$ becomes finite, rather than being extremely slow, as it is stated in the article. Thus, the statement "the charge carriers' group velocity $v_ F$ is extremely slow" is incorrect and leads the authors to the conceptional misunderstanding, confusing the reader.</p>

            <p>Understanding how light modifies long-range order in quantum materials is key to improving our ability to control functionality. However, this is challenging if the response is heterogeneous. Here we address the most common form of light-induced heterogeneity, surface melting, and measure the dynamics of orbital order in the layered manganite, La0.5Sr1.5MnO4. We isolate the surface dynamics from the bulk by measuring the orbital truncation rod as well as orbital Bragg peak. After photoexcitation, the orbital Bragg peak shows an unusual narrowing, which suggests an increase in the correlation length in the probed volume. In contrast, the correlation length at the surface decreases. These differences can be reconciled if the material is heterogeneous, and light melts a less ordered surface. By isolating the surface response, we determine that the loss of long-range order is an incoherent process, which is likely accompanied by the formation of local polarons.</p>

            <p>We report the observation of Shapiro steps in a periodically driven Josephson junction between strongly-interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. We observe quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics, the height and width of which mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations, overall providing a clear understanding of Shapiro dynamics in atomic Fermi superfluids. Our work demonstrates phase-coherent and synchronization effects in driven strongly-interacting superfluids, opening prospects for studying emergent non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems under external drives.</p>

            <h2>Charge Susceptibility and Kubo Response in Hatsugai-Kohmoto-related Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuhao Ma, Jinchao Zhao, Edwin W. Huang, Dhruv Kush, Barry Bradlyn, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>We study in depth the charge susceptibility for the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) and orbital (OHK) models. As either of these models describes a Mott insulator, the charge susceptibility takes on the form of a modified density response function with lower and upper Hubbard bands, thereby giving rise to a multi-pole structure. The particle-hole continuum consists of hot spots along the $\omega$ vs $q$ axis arising from inter-band transitions. Such transitions, which are strongly suppressed in non-interacting systems, obtain here because of the non-rigidity of the Hubbard bands. This modified density response function gives rise to a plasmon dispersion that is inversely dependent on the momentum, resulting in an additional contribution to the conventional f-sum rule. This extra contribution originates from a long-range diamagnetic contribution to the current. This results in a non-commutativity of the long-wavelength ($q\rightarrow 0$) and thermodynamic ($L\rightarrow\infty$) limits. When the correct limits are taken, we find that the Kubo response computed with either open or periodic boundary conditions yields identical results that are consistent with the continuity equation contrary to recent claims. We also show that the long wavelength pathology of the current noted previously also plagues the Anderson impurity model interpretation of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).</p>

            <h2>Multiple Majorana bound states and their resilience against disorder in planar Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pankaj Sharma, Narayan Mohanta</p>
            <p>Planar Josephson junctions are theoretically predicted to harbor zero-energy Majorana bound states (MBS) in a tunable two-dimensional geometry, at the two ends of the middle metallic channel. Here we show that three distinct topological superconducting regimes, governing the localization of the near-zero-energy MBS, appear in these planar Josephson junctions. The topologically-protected MBS appear near the narrow edges of the junction -- not only in the middle metallic channel but also in the superconducting leads which have widths similar to the values used in recent experiments. We incorporate random fluctuation in the chemical potential to investigate the influence of non-magnetic disorder on the localization of the MBS in different topological regimes and find that the MBS are quite robust against disorder because of the two-dimensional geometry. Interestingly, moderate amount of disorder reduces the splitting between the MBS pairs, possibly by minimizing the wave function overlap of the MBS. We also discuss the changes in the topological superconducting phases when the superconducting lead width is varied. Our results reveal a rich structure of the localization of topologically protected multiple MBS in experimentally-accessible planar Josephson junctions, and call for their experimental confirmation.</p>

            <p>Quantum spintronics is an emerging field focused on developing novel applications by utilizing the quantum coherence of magnetic systems. A key challenge in this context is achieving scalable long-range quantum information transmission in magnetic systems. Here, we propose a novel transmission scheme based on topological spin textures in a hybrid architecture combining a magnetic racetrack and localized spin qubits. We demonstrate this principle by employing the domain wall (DW), the most fundamental texture, to transport quantum signal between distant qubits. We introduce a measurement-free protocol that utilizes DW mobility to enable high-fidelity and tunable entanglement generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that spin qubits can function as quantum stations on the racetrack, enabling flexible state transfer among fast-moving DWs on a single track. Finally, we discuss concrete material platforms to implement the proposed scheme. Our work introduces a new hybrid quantum platform that merges topological spin textures with solid-state qubits, offering a scalable architecture for quantum information processing and opening promising directions for quantum spintronics.</p>

            <p>Among all materials, mono-crystalline diamond has one of the highest measured thermal conductivities, with values above 2000 W/m/K at room temperature. This stems from momentum-conserving `normal' phonon-phonon scattering processes dominating over momentum-dissipating `Umklapp' processes, a feature that also suggests diamond as an ideal platform to experimentally investigate phonon heat transport phenomena that violate Fourier's law. Here, we introduce dilute nitrogen-vacancy color centers as in-situ, highly precise spin defect thermometers to image temperature inhomogeneities in single-crystal diamond microstructures heated from ambient conditions. We analyze cantilevers with cross-sections in the range from about 0.2 to 2.6 $\mu$m$^2$, observing a strong reduction of the cantilevers' conductivity as the width decreases. We use first-principles simulations based on the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation and viscous heat equations to quantitatively predict the cantilevers' thermal transport properties, rationalizing how the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic phonon scattering mechanisms determines the observed non-diffusive behavior. Our temperature-imaging method paves the way for the exploration of unconventional, non-diffusive heat transport phenomena in devices and nanostructures of arbitrary geometries.</p>

            <p>The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p>

It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, current without density gradient, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a new transport effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-range colored noise. Active processes driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</p>

Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process.

            <p>The two-body contact is a fundamental quantity of a dilute Bose gas that relates the thermodynamics to the short-distance two-body correlations. For a Bose gas in an optical lattice, near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition, we show that a ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be defined from the singular part $P-P_{\rm MI}$ of the pressure ($P_{\rm MI}$ is the pressure of the Mott insulator). Its expression $C_{\rm univ}=C_{\rm DBG}(|n-n^{\rm MI}|,a^*)$ coincides with that of a dilute Bose gas provided we consider the effective ``scattering length'' $a^*$ of the quasi-particles at the quantum critical point (QCP) rather than the scattering length in vacuum, and the excess density $|n-n^{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. Close to the transition, we find that the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k} = n_{\bf k} - n^{\rm MI}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution exhibits a high-momentum tail of the form $Z_{\rm QP} C_{\rm univ}/|{\bf k}|^4$ over a broad region of the Brillouin zone, where $Z_{\rm QP}$ is the quasi-particle weight of the elementary excitations at the QCP. Our results demonstrate that the notion of contact extends to strongly correlated lattice bosons, and we argue that the contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be measured in state-of-the-art experiments on Bose gases in optical lattices and magnetic insulators.</p>

            <p>We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid state near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties (electronic contribution) of a normal-superconductor (NS) hybrid junction, where the normal region consists of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Weber, Maxime Vassaux, Lukas Laubert, Sebastian Pfaller</p>
            <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are widely used to provide insights into fracture mechanisms while maintaining chemical specificity. However, particle-based techniques such as MD are limited in terms of accessible length scales and applicable boundary conditions, which restricts the investigation of fracture phenomena in typical engineering settings. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we apply the partitioned-domain Capriccio method to couple atomistic MD samples representing silica glass with the finite element (FE) method. With this approach, we perform mode I (rectangular panel under tension, three-, and four-point bending), mode II as well as mode III (rectangular panel under in-plane or out-of-plane shear) simulations. Thereby, we investigate multiple criteria to identify the onset of crack propagation based on the virial stress, the number of pair interactions, the kinetic energy/temperature, the crack velocity, and the crack opening displacement. The approach presented provides quantitatively plausible results for the critical stress intensity factors KIc, KIIc, and KIIIc. This contribution shows that the Capriccio method is a flexible means of performing fracture simulations that take into account boundary conditions typical of experimental test setups with atomistic specificity near the crack tip. While also pointing out the current limitations of the Capriccio method, we demonstrate its potential to integrate atomistic insights into FE models with significantly larger overall dimensions.</p>

In spite of great effort, the observations of multiple TPs in a single material and multiple TP transitions in the presence of one parameter remain elusive. Here we demonstrate the presence of multiple TPs and their transitions with uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) in orthorhombic Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using $state$-$of$-$the$-$art$ $ab$-$initio$ calculations. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits a single (type-II) nodal-ring and in the presence of SOC, it hosts Weyl phase with seven Weyl points (three at $\Gamma$ and four at general positions) along with nodal arcs. On the application of UCS, it remains type-II nodal-ring $<5.5$\%, which further evolves into type-III nodal-ring for $5.5\% \leq$ UCS $<5.6$\%. Interestingly, at 5.6\% of UCS, it shows Weyl phase with four Weyl nodes even in the absence of SOC. All the above-mentioned seven Weyl points persist below $5$\% of UCS. For 5\% $\leq$ UCS $<5.6$\%, four Weyl points (at general positions) disappear and nodal-arcs remain intact in all the studied range of UCS. The TPs observed in the absence of SOC appears to arise due to the presence of strain driven topological flat band, which is typically reported to be seen in kagome and Lieb lattices.</p>

            <h2>Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the square lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko</p>
            <p>Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions are able to extract accurate information about quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>The Low-Temperature Phenomenology of Gap Inhomogeneity in the Cuprate Superconductors: High-Energy Granularity, Low-Energy Homogeneity, and Spectral Kinks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Antonio Sulangi</p>
            <p>Scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on a number of cuprate superconductors have revealed that these materials are highly inhomogeneous. However, even though this inhomogeneity is well-characterized experimentally, a theoretical understanding of the effect of an inhomogeneous superconducting $d$-wave order parameter on various observables is still not complete. Here, we focus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting order-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches tiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value of the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to study how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various measures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the length scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting coherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous. However, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length, we find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the low-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly inhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating the homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap extracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find in both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower than that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of the patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment on the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations of the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field correlation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.</p>

            <h2>Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Le Doussal</p>
            <p>We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.</p>

            <h2>Inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation and entropy production</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Van Tuan Vo, Andreas Dechant, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>Nonequilibrium current fluctuations represent one of the central topics in nonequilibrium physics. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is widely acclaimed for rigorously establishing a lower bound on current fluctuations, expressed in terms of the entropy production rate and the average current. In this study, we focus on an upper bound for the fluctuations, referred to as the inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation (iTUR). We derive a universal iTUR expression in terms of the entropy production rate for continuous-variable systems governed by overdamped Langevin equations, as well as for discrete-variable systems described by Markov jump processes. The iTUR establishes a no-go theorem prohibiting perpetual superdiffusion in systems with a finite entropy production rate and a finite spectral gap. The divergence of the variance of any current becomes possible only when the spectral gap of the symmetrized time-evolution operator closes or the entropy production rate diverges. As a relevant experimental scenario, we apply the iTUR to the phenomenon of giant diffusion, emphasizing the pivotal roles of the spectral gap and entropy production.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium Statistics of Biased Kondo Resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jong E. Han</p>
            <p>Numerical renormalization group (NRG) is formulated for nonequilibrium steady-state by converting finite-lattice many-body eigenstates into scattering states. Extension of the full-density-matrix NRG for a biased Anderson impurity model, simplified by formulating with the original orbital basis as the Hamiltonian, enables detailed studies of the sub-Kondo spectral evolution in the zero-temperature limit, confirming the double-resonance structure at bias of the Kondo energy scale $T_K$. The distribution shows distinct multi-scale spectral features at energy $\omega$ below the Kondo scale ($\omega\lesssim T_K$) and near the bias ($\omega\gtrsim V$), leading to the nonequilibrium temperature $T_{\rm loc}$ local to the Kondo dot scaling as $k_BT_{\rm loc}\approx V$ for $V\gg T_K$. The current-voltage relation in the low-temperature limit ($T\ll T_K$) deviates from the unitary limit as the bias exceeds the Kondo scale ($V/2\gtrsim T_K$) and reaches the current saturation regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunki Yamamoto, Masahiro Sato, Satoshi Fujimoto, Takeshi Mizushima</p>
            <p>Optical vortex beams are a type of topological light characterized by their inherent orbital angular momentum, leading to the propagation of a spiral-shaped wavefront. In this study, we focus on two-dimensional electrons with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions and examine how they respond to pulsed vortex beams in the terahertz frequency band. Spin-orbital interactions play a vital role in transferring the orbital angular momentum of light to electron systems and generating spatiotemporal spin textures. We show that the spatiotemporal spin polarization of electrons reflects orbital angular momentum carried by optical vortex pulses. These findings demonstrate how optical vortices facilitate ultrafast spin manipulation in spin-orbit-coupled electrons. Our results can be straightforwardly extended to the case of higher-frequency vortex beams for other two-dimensional metals with a larger Fermi energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brenna C. Bierman, Gillian Nolan, Hongrui Ma, Ying Wang, Pinshane Huang, Daniel A. Rhodes</p>
            <p>Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we demonstrate the presence of structural heterogeneity captured by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that eludes the routine characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electronic transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtained crystals diverse in stoichiometry and structure, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\lesssim{x}\lesssim1$. Using SCXRD, we found global structural diversity, identifying three new structure types: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{2.0}$/Sn$_{0.08}$TaSe$_{1.96}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.16}$TaSe$_{2.0}$ ($P6_3/mmc$), and Sn$_{1.2}$TaSe$_{1.9}$ ($Fmm2$). Using STEM, we observed local structural diversity, manifested as regions of highly variable stacking within a single crystal. In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction did not resolve all observed global structures. Raman spectroscopy was unable to distinguish between different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Electronic transport measurements showed consistent superconductivity and charge density wave behavior irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount. Our results indicate that routine approaches to characterization of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides may be inadequate for capturing the diversity of this family of materials, highlighting the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.</p>

            <h2>Exploring two dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant phases with time reversal symmetry and their transitions with topological operations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryan C. Spieler</p>
            <p>We use various topological operations to systematically study phase transitions between theories with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and time reversal symmetry in two spacetime dimensions. The phases (and accompanying CFTs) we consider come in two types - bosonic phases that are defined on unorientable manifolds and fermionic phases that are sensitive to a $\text{Pin}^-$ structure. In both cases, our analysis leads to eight phase diagrams, with the two sets of eight connected by fermionization/bosonization. Starting from a seed CFT, we obtain the CFT that governs each transition. Many of these exhibit symmetry enriched criticality. In addition to showing many symmetry enriched CFTs in their natural habitats, our work discusses the fermionic analogs of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ bosonic operations, which we have not seen discussed in the literature.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian band topology in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamalesh Bera, Debasish Mondal, Arijit Saha, Debashree Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Utilizing the established Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we theoretically investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) topological properties of this in the presence of non-reciprocal (NR) hopping on both layers and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) induced mass term incorporated only on the top layer of the tBLG system. It is well known that the hBN mass term breaks the \(C_{2}\) symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing a valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this system transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals that, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH effects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as we enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity (\(\beta\)). At the magic angle, we observe that enhancement of \(\beta\) inflates the robustness of the gapless Dirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the NH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of twist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed. To explore the topological aspects of the NH tBLG, we analyze the direct band gap in the Moiré Brillouin zone (mBZ) and compute the Chern number for the NH system. We find that the corresponding topological phase transitions are associated with corresponding direct band gap closings in the mBZ.</p>

            <p>We present an extension of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) that incorporates Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to investigate the interplay between disorder, spin-orbit interaction, and nonlocal spatial correlations in disordered two-dimensional systems. By analyzing the average density of states, momentum-resolved self-energy, and return probability, we demonstrate how Rashba SOC and nonlocal correlations jointly modify single-particle properties and spin-dependent interference. The method captures key features of the symplectic universality class, including SOC-induced delocalization signatures at finite times. We benchmark the DCA results against those obtained from the numerically exact kernel polynomial method, finding good agreement. This validates the computationally efficient, mean-field-based DCA framework as a robust tool for exploring disorder, spin-orbit coupling, and nonlocal correlation effects in low-dimensional systems, and paves the way for simulating multiorbital and strongly correlated systems that were previously inaccessible due to computational limitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Silpa Mariya, Jeremy J. Barr, P. Sunthar, J. Ravi Prakash</p>
            <p>We investigate the static and dynamic properties of dendrimers diffusing through a network of linear associative polymers using coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations. Both dendrimers and network chains are modelled as bead-spring chain polymers, with hydrodynamic interactions incorporated for the accurate prediction of dynamic properties. Linear chains form a network via the associating groups distributed along their backbones, and the dendrimers interact attractively or repulsively with the network, enabling a direct comparison of sticky and non-sticky behaviour of dendrimers. Structural analysis reveals that while non-sticky dendrimers shrink with increasing network concentration, similar to linear polymer behaviour, sticky dendrimers exhibit stretching at low concentrations due to binding interactions. Dendrimer dynamics are largely insensitive to network architecture but are strongly influenced by the strength of dendrimer-network interactions. Increasing attraction to the network leads to subdiffusive motion and non-Gaussian displacement statistics, even when dendrimers are smaller than the average mesh size. The long-time diffusivity aligns with theoretical predictions for nanoparticle transport in polymer networks. Additionally, dendrimers deform the network locally, altering the mesh size distribution depending on their stickiness. These findings offer insight into the interplay between macromolecular architecture, binding interactions, and transport in polymeric environments.</p>

The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pok Man Tam, Hao Chen, Biao Lian</p>
            <p>Quantum Hall edge states in proximity to a superconductor (SC) usually acquire a non-quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability in transport, due to non-universal SC couplings and disorders. With counter-propagating modes, we show that the situation can be the opposite in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states with SC proximity, where disordered SC-couplings can reconstruct the edge states into an infinite set of stable phases with quantized electron-to-hole conversion probability along a long edge. Each phase is dominated by a disordered SC-coupling that tunnels $\pm |q_N|$ Cooper pairs, which can take values $|q_N|=1, 4, 15$, etc. We predict that this gives rise to a quantized downstream resistance $R_d = h/(2q^2_Ne^2)$ in an FQH-SC junction, serving as a quantized electrical transport signature beyond the Hall conductance. Higher-order nonlinear transport due to irrelevant Cooper pair tunneling or vortex dissipation is further studied, which becomes dominant when the edge is in a normal phase. Our results apply to both the single-layer state (as a particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=1/3$) and the bilayer Halperin-(112) state, revealing a rich landscape of disorder-stabilized phases in FQH edge states with SC proximity, and may as well apply to fractional Chern insulators recently observed at the same filling.</p>

            <p>Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>One-dimensional integrable and quasi-integrable systems display, on macroscopic scales, a universal form of transport known as Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD). In its standard Euler-scale formulation, GHD mirrors the equations of a two-dimensional compressible fluid but ignores fluctuations and becomes numerically unwieldy as soon as integrability-breaking perturbations are introduced. We show that GHD can be efficiently simulated as a gas of semiclassical wave packets - a natural generalisation of hard-rod particles - whose trajectories are efficiently mapped onto those of point particles. This representation (i) provides a transparent route to incorporate integrability-breaking terms, and (ii) automatically embeds the exact fluctuating-hydrodynamics extension of GHD. The resulting framework enables fast, large-scale simulations of quasi-integrable systems even in the presence of complicated integrability-breaking perturbations. It also manifest the pivotal role of two-point correlations in systems confined by external potentials: we demonstrate that situations where local one-point observables appear thermalised can nevertheless sustain long-lived, far-from-equilibrium long-range correlations for arbitrarily long times, signaling that, differently from what previously stated, true thermalisation is not reached at diffusive time-scales.</p>

            <p>Square Wave Perceptrons (SWPs) form a class of neural network models with oscillating activation function that exhibit intriguing ``hardness'' properties in the high-dimensional limit at a fixed constraint density $\alpha = O(1)$. In this work, we examine two key aspects of these models. The first is related to the so-called \emph{overlap-gap property}, that is a disconnectivity feature of the geometry of the solution space of combinatorial optimization problems proven to cause the failure of a large family of solvers, and conjectured to be a symptom of algorithmic hardness. We identify, both in the storage and in the teacher-student settings, the emergence of an overlap gap at a threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{OGP}}(\delta)$, which can be made arbitrarily small by suitably increasing the frequency of oscillations $1/\delta$ of the activation. This suggests that in this small-$\delta$ regime, typical instances of the problem are hard to solve even for small values of $\alpha$. Second, in the teacher-student setup, we show that the recovery threshold of the planted signal for message-passing algorithms can be made arbitrarily large by reducing $\delta$. These properties make SWPs both a challenging benchmark for algorithms and an interesting candidate for cryptographic applications.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous diffusion and directed coalescence of condensates out of equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andriy Goychuk</p>
            <p>Phase separation into domains with distinct composition and properties has widespread implications, ranging from alloys and emulsions to biomolecular condensates in cells. In living and nonliving matter, the organization of these domains can be controlled by nonequilibrium chemical reactions, external fields, or mechanical stresses. In this context, stationary states can emerge from long-range monopolar interactions analogous to electrostatics. More generally, as discussed here, because fluxes induce dipolar force fields, externally controlled boundary motion effectively polarizes the domain even for microscopically nonpolarizable matter. The dipole-dipole interactions resulting from this translation-induced polarization cause directed coalescence of domains. This coarsening mechanism complements Ostwald ripening and coalescence due to Brownian motion or Marangoni flows, and has implications for controlling domains by electric fields or concentration gradients. Interestingly, the chemical potential gradients around a domain that nucleates material are exactly opposite to the hydrodynamic pressure gradients around an impermeable colloid that pushes the fluid, suggesting a competition between phase separation and hydrodynamics. In addition to chemical control, the motion of domains can also be driven by mechanical stresses. An example is the cell interior, where mechanical stresses are actively generated by molecular motors and opposed by passive viscoelastic stresses in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. The resulting fluid flows lead to Brownian motion with a suppressed or enhanced size scaling which modifies collision-coalescence. For active stresses with a long correlation time, the domains show superdiffusion on intermediate time scales. Together, these findings shed new light on the dynamics of domains in viscoelastic media and conserved order parameters in general.</p>

            <h2>Exact zero modes in interacting Majorana X- and Y-junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bowy M. La Rivière, Rik Mulder, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>We report the emergence of exact zero modes in junctions of two, three and four short interacting Majorana wires, equivalent to a chain with an impurity bond, Y- and X- junctions respectively. These exact zero modes are due to incommensurate short-range correlations induced by the interacting Majorana fermions, and they appear as unavoided level crossings between in-gap states upon continuously tuning the interaction. In a junction of only two chains we report exact zero modes and parity switching as soon as the coupling between the chains across a junction is positive. Remarkably, for junctions with multiple chains the in-gap states group up into sets of parity pairs -- pairs of states with opposite parity and similar energies. We demonstrate that the formation of these parity pairs are always due to the interaction of the outer edges of the junction. The behavior within each pair can be efficiently described by two coupled chains. In the Y-junction, we detect four in-gap states (two parity pairs) that show exact zero modes not only within each pair but also between them. This is attributed to an additional Majorana fermion localized at the center of junction that is protected by symmetry. Therefore, coupling between the Majorana fermions at the outer edges of the junction is mediated by that in the center. We argue that this is a generic feature of junctions with an odd number of arms. In the X-junction we detect eight in-gap states (four parity pairs) that are the result of two Majorana degrees of freedom localized at the center of the junction. However, we demonstrate that, by contrast to the Y-junction, the appearance of Majorana fermions at the center of the X-junction is not protected and the interaction across the junction can be tuned to the point where there are only Majorana fermions localized at the four outer edges of the junction, forming four in-gap states.</p>

Here, we introduce a rapid spectroscopic technique based on projection of the interacting state onto an alternate scattering channel with a low-lying dimer state. We demonstrate contact measurements on the microsecond timescale -- faster than the inverse Fermi energy. Using $^{40}$K near a broad $s$-wave Feshbach resonance, we show that the strength of the dimer-projection feature scales proportionally with the contact parameter extracted from the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Analysis of the spectra further reveals that the dimer feature provides the dominant contribution to the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, allowing the first experimental bound on this quantity. The observed deviations from universal predictions highlight the importance of multichannel effects. Our results open new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.</p>

            <h2>Efficient optimization of variational tensor-network approach to three-dimensional statistical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xia-Ze Xu, Tong-Yu Lin, Guang-Ming Zhang</p>
            <p>Variational tensor network optimization has become a powerful tool for studying classical statistical models in two dimensions. However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such a triple-layer network, which reduces the computational complexity while keeping high accuracy. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.</p>

            <h2>Topological Flat Minibands and Fractional Chern Insulators in Rashba Systems with Tunable Superlattice Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bokai Liang, Wei Qin, Zhenyu Zhang</p>
            <p>We propose a programmable platform for engineering topological flat minibands by imposing a tunable electrostatic superlattice potential on a Rashba spin-orbit-coupled thin film subject to a Zeeman field. The interplay between the superlattice potential and Zeeman coupling produces an isolated flat miniband with Chern number $\mathcal{C}=1$. Using many-body exact diagonalization, we show that this miniband supports fractional Chern insulators at filling factors $n = 1/3$ and $2/3$, both of which remain robust over broad parameter ranges. We further identify realistic material candidates and the corresponding device conditions that enable experimental realization. These results establish a versatile and experimentally accessible platform for engineering topological flat minibands and exploring correlated topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Heterogeneity in Supercooled Water and its Spectroscopic Fingerprints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Malosso, Edward Danquah Donkor, Stefano Baroni, Ali Hassanali</p>
            <p>A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nianrui Fu, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving nonabelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multidimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to nonabelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of nonabelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of nonabelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions. Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength. These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures and devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob Morgan (1), Simon Cox (1) ((1) Department of Mathematics, Aberystwyth University, UK)</p>
            <p>Aqueous foams are subject to coarsening, whereby gas from the bubbles diffuses through the liquid phase. Gas is preferentially transported from small to large bubbles, resulting in a gradual decrease of the number of bubbles and an increase in the average bubble size. Coarsening foams are expected to approach a scaling state at late times in which their statistical properties are invariant. However, a model predicting the experimentally observed bubble-size distribution in the scaling state of foams with moderate liquid content, as a function of the liquid fraction $\phi$, has not yet been developed. To this end, we propose a three-dimensional mean-field bubble growth law for foams without inter-bubble adhesion, validated against bubble-scale simulations, and use it to derive a prediction of the scaling-state bubble-size distribution for any $\phi$ from zero up to the unjamming transition $\phi_\text{c} \approx 36\%$. We verify that the derived scaling state is approached from a variety of initial conditions using mean-field simulations implementing the proposed growth law. Comparing our predicted bubble-size distribution with previous simulations and experimental results, we likewise find a large population of small bubbles when $\phi > 0$, but there are qualitative differences from prior results which we attribute to the absence of rattlers, i.e. bubbles not pressed into contact with their neighbours, in our model.</p>

            <h2>Optical Signatures of Band Flatness and Anisotropic Quantum Geometry in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pok Man Chiu</p>
            <p>We study the degree of band flatness and anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the lattice relaxation through optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth between two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of generalized optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Finally, we demonstrate that the condition of vanishing of flat band velocities and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case.</p>

            <p>Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has enabled physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented accessibility. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. An intriguing theoretical prediction of a characteristic phenomenon of BECs is anomalous tunneling, whereby low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy regime, and experimentally measure these frequencies using Oqtant. Our results reveal that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs, as well as highlight the potential of cloud-based experiments in quantum-body physics.</p>

            <h2>Bogoliubov quasi-particles in superconductors are integer-charged particles inapplicable for braiding quantum information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Fan, Wei Ku</p>
            <p>We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian, one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Talkachov, Egor Babaev</p>
            <p>We study conditions of the appearance of $U(1)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ superconducting states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) on a square lattice as a function of applied stress. Calculations show that if critical temperatures coincide at zero stress, they exhibit a linear kink and no kink otherwise for uniaxial and isotropic strain. Linear kink is absent for shear strain. We find that in general, the microscopic calculations show a complex phase diagram, for example, non-monotonic behavior of BTRS transition. Another beyond-Ginzburg-Landau theory result is that $U(1)$ critical temperature can decrease under compressional [100] uniaxial strain for small Poisson ratio materials. In the second part of the paper, we consider the effects of boundaries and finiteness of the sample on the strain-induced splitting of $T_c^{U(1)}$ and $T_c^{\mathbb{Z}_2}$ transitions. A finite sample has BTRS boundary states with persistent superconducting currents over a wide range of band filling. Overall, the BTRS dome occupies a larger band filling--temperature phase space region for a mesoscopic sample with [110] surface compared to an infinite system. Hence, the presence of boundaries helps to stabilize the BTRS phase.</p>

            <p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.</p>

            <p>The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.</p>

            <p>We analyze the leading vestigial instability due to the melting of a bidirectional pair-density-wave state in two dimensions. In a previous work by one of the authors, it was found that the interplay between pair-density-wave fluctuations with ordering momenta along the $x$ and $y$ directions can provide a strong attractive interaction for charge-$4e$ superconductivity in the $d$-wave channel. In this work, we go beyond the artificial large-$M$ mean-field theory previously adopted and compute the phase diagram by incorporating phase fluctuations of the pair-density-wave order parameters. By investigating the relevance of various topological defects, we show that the interaction in the $d$-wave channel, together with the strong anisotropy of phase fluctuations around the pair-density-wave ordering momenta, favors a vestigial charge-$4e$ superconducting order at intermediate temperatures. By contrast, a competing charge-density-wave vestigial order does not develop, due to the suppression of its stiffness.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit even-parity nonrelativistic spin splitting, odd-parity magnets (OPMs) have been proposed and emerged as a novel research frontier. In this study, we perform a comprehensive spin group symmetry analysis to establish symmetry criteria for the emergence of OPMs. We identify eight distinct symmetry-driven cases that support OPMs, enabling their realization in collinear, coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic orders. These OPMs are categorized into three types based on their spin textures for Bloch states: collinear (type-I), coplanar (type-II), and noncoplanar (type-III). For type-I OPMs, we further delineate additional symmetry requirements for $p$-wave and $f$-wave spin splitting. We identify 48 candidate materials in the Magndata database that satisfy these symmetry criteria. Additionally, we construct two theoretical models to validate the effectiveness of the established symmetry criteria. Finally, we show that OPMs can exhibit an intrinsic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and construct a theoretical model to realize this phase.</p>

            <p>Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the Néel temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.</p>

            <p>Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</p>

            <p>The field of coherent electronics aims to advance electronic functionalities by utilizing quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate a viable and versatile methodology for controlling electron dynamics optically in graphene nanoribbons. In particular, we propose to flatten the band structure of armchair graphene nanoribbons via control electrodes, arranged periodically along the extended direction of the nanoribbon. This addresses a key mechanism for dephasing in solids, which derives from the momentum dependence of the energy gap between the valence and the conduction band. We design an optimal driving field pulse to produce collective Rabi oscillations between these bands, in their flattened configuration. As an example for coherent control, we show that these optimized pulses can be used to invert the entire electronic band population by a $\pi$ pulse in a reversible fashion, and to create a superposition state via a $\pi/2$ pulse, which generates an alternating photocurrent. Our proposal consists of a platform and methodological approach to optically control the electron dynamics of graphene nanoribbons, paving the way toward novel coherent electronic and quantum information processing devices in solid-state materials.</p>

            <p>Traditional quantum speed limits formulated in density matrix space are generally unattainable for a wide class of dynamics and it is difficult to characterize the fastest possible dynamics. To address this, we present two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty relations for operators acting on Liouville space, and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. We also obtain the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal CPTP dynamics that connect the given initial and target states. To illustrate our findings, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. In another important application, we show that our results can help us understand the counter-intuitive phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics, as the minimal relaxation time scale obtained by speed limits is dictated by the eigenmodes of the Liouvillian.</p>

            <p>We investigate the efficiency of approximate counterdiabatic driving (CD) in accelerating adiabatic passage through exponentially small gaps. First, we analyze a minimal spin-glass bottleneck model that is analytically tractable and exhibits both an exponentially small gap at the transition point and a change in the ground state that involves a macroscopic rearrangement of spins. Using the variational Floquet-Krylov expansion to construct CD terms, we find that while the formation of excitations is significantly suppressed, achieving a fully adiabatic evolution remains challenging. Extending our investigation to realistic NP-hard spin-glass problems -- specifically, the $3$-regular \textsc{Max Cut} and $3$-\textsc{XORSAT} -- we find again that local CD expansions lead to negligible improvements in the final ground state fidelity. These results highlight the limited impact of local CD methods in overcoming the bottlenecks associated with first-order quantum phase transitions. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method, termed quantum brachistochrone counterdiabatic driving (QBCD), which employs the approximate full CD connecting the ground state and the first excited state at a single parameter value close to the critical point. In the minimal spin-glass model, QBCD enables exponentially faster adiabatic evolution than the local strategies. To alleviate the challenges of its experimental and classical implementation for realistic \textsc{NP}-hard problems, we exponentially reduce the non-locality of the QBCD Hamiltonian by sparsifying its matrix elements to the density of the local expansions. Despite this drastic simplification, sparsified QBCD maintains finite ground-state fidelity at driving times exponentially shorter than in local strategies and counterdiabatic optimized local driving (COLD).</p>

            <p>Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta > 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau > 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau < \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau > \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau>\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the lower bound on the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the lower bound on the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive fundamental precision limits, dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectations of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are set by quantities such as dimensions and energy bandwidth, which depend only on the initial configuration and are independent of the dynamics. Using a quantum battery model, the fundamental precision limits show that there is a trade-off between the amount of energy storage and the charging precision. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental limits, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can improve the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.</p>

            <h2>Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhian Jia</p>
            <p>We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolition readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of MHz range fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emma C. King, Moritz Linnebacher, Peter P. Orth, Matteo Rizzi, Giovanna Morigi</p>
            <p>A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d>4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0<\alpha<3d/2$. For $\alpha<d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d<\alpha<d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s>4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.</p>

Our theoretical analysis leads to the identification of a single functional of the system parameters that governs the entropy dynamics.

            <h2>Fractional stochastic model of citation dynamics with memory and volatility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keisuke Okamura</p>
            <p>Understanding the statistical laws governing citation dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in network theory and the science of science. Citation networks typically exhibit in-degree distributions well approximated by log-normal distributions yet also display power-law behaviour in the high-citation regime -- an apparent contradiction lacking a unified explanation. Here we identify a previously unrecognised phenomenon: the variance of the logarithm of citation counts per unit time follows a power law with respect to time ($t$) since publication, scaling as $t^{H}$, with $H$ constant. This discovery introduces a new challenge while simultaneously offering a crucial clue to resolving this discrepancy. We develop a stochastic model in which latent attention to publications evolves through a memory-driven process with cumulative advantage, modelled as fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H$ and volatility. We show that antipersistent fluctuations in attention ($H < 1/2$) yield log-normal citation distributions, whereas persistent attention dynamics ($H > 1/2$) favour heavy-tailed power laws, thus resolving the log-normal--power-law contradiction. Numerical simulations confirm both the $t^{H}$ law and the transition between regimes. Empirical analysis of arXiv e-prints indicates that the latent attention process is intrinsically antipersistent ($H \approx 0.13$). By linking memory effects and stochastic fluctuations in attention to broader network dynamics, our findings provide a unifying framework for understanding the evolution of collective attention in science and other attention-driven processes.</p>

            <p>While scattered light conveys most of the information we perceive, scattering may also distort that information before it reaches our detectors. The problem is acute in many applications, such as in high-resolution microscopy of biological tissue, where scattering degrades both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms. Because the strategy relies solely on the properties of scattered light and high-order nonlinear response of the fluorophores, it can be applied to any speckle-forming propagation, from biological tissue to multicore fibres, combined with any type of phenomenon that exhibits a sufficiently high order nonlinearity.</p>

For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions - the $\textit{monopoles}$ - proliferate.</p>

            <p>To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional).

            <p>Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength and nature of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with a computationally efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics. Through two illustrative examples, we conduct initial-value simulations that show that, as the stiffness of the filament is decreased, the dynamic behaviour moves from rigid motion to planar buckling, through an out-of-plane transition, eventually reaching diffusive-like behaviours for very deformable filaments.</p>

            <p>The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neil Dowling, Jacopo De Nardis, Markus Heinrich, Xhek Turkeshi, Silvia Pappalardi</p>
            <p>Unitary randomness underpins both fundamental tasks in quantum information and the modern theory of quantum chaos. On one side, a central concept is that of approximate unitary designs: circuits that look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. In a distinct setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), intensely studied as a measure of information scrambling, have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the noncommutative generalization of statistical independence. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables, while traceless observables instead require exponential resources. Indeed, local observables are precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Moreover, adding to previous literature, we show how random matrix product unitaries constitute approximate designs: we exactly compute the frame potential of the ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value with polynomial deviations and so indicating that global observables are freely independent on-average. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage and shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</p>

We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</p>

            <p>Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diyath Pannipitiya, Roland Roeder</p>
            <p>Let $Z_n(z,t)$ denote the partition function of the $q$-state Potts Model on the rooted binary Cayley tree of depth~$n$. Here, $z = {\rm e}^{-h/T}$ and $t = {\rm e}^{-J/T}$ with $h$ denoting an externally applied magnetic field, $T$ the temperature, and $J$ a coupling constant. One can interpret $z$ as a ``magnetic field-like'' variable and $t$ as a ``temperature-like'' variable. Physical values $h \in \mathbb{R}$, $T > 0$, and $J \in \mathbb{R}$ correspond to $t \in (0,\infty)$ and $z \in (0,\infty)$. For any fixed $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$ and fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we consider the complex zeros of $Z_n(z,t_0)$ and how they accumulate on the ray $(0,\infty)$ of physical values for $z$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In the ferromagnetic case ($J > 0$ or equivalently $t \in (0,1)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to at most one point on $(0,\infty)$ which we describe using explicit formulae. In the antiferromagnetic case $(J < 0$ or equivalently $t \in (1,\infty)$) these Lee-Yang zeros accumulate to finitely many points of $(0,\infty)$, which we again describe with explicit formulae. The same results hold for the unrooted Cayley tree of branching number two. These results are proved by adapting a renormalization procedure that was previously used in the case of the Ising model on the Cayley Tree by Müller-Hartmann and Zittartz (1974 and 1977), Barata and Marchetti (1997), and Barata and Goldbaum (2001). We then use methods from complex dynamics and, more specifically, the active/passive dichotomy for iteration of a marked point, along with detailed analysis of the renormalization mappings, to prove the main results.</p>

The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model.

            <h2>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atma Anand</p>
            <p>Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</p>

            <p>Higher symmetries in interacting many-body systems often give rise to new phases and unexpected dynamical behavior. Here, we theoretically investigate a variant of the Dicke model with higher-order discrete symmetry, resulting from complex-valued coupling coefficients between quantum emitters and a bosonic mode. We propose a driven-dissipative realization of this model focusing on optomechanical response of a driven atom tweezer array comprised of $n$ sub-ensembles and placed within an optical cavity, with the phase of the driving field advancing stepwise between sub-ensembles. Examining stationary points and their dynamical stability, we identify a phase diagram for $n\geq 3$ with three distinctive features: a $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_{2n}$) symmetry-breaking superradiant phase for even (odd) $n$, a normal unbroken-symmetry phase that is dynamically unstable due to non-reciprocal forces between emitters, and a first-order phase transition separating these phases. This $n$-phase Dicke model may be equivalently realized in a variety of optomechanical or opto-magnonic settings, where it can serve as a testbed for studying high-order symmetry breaking and non-reciprocal interactions in open systems.</p>

We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <h2>Coherent Optical Control of Electron Dynamics in Patterned Graphene Nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riek H. Rüstemeier, H. P. Ojeda Collado, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>The field of coherent electronics aims to advance electronic functionalities by utilizing quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate a viable and versatile methodology for controlling electron dynamics optically in graphene nanoribbons. In particular, we propose to flatten the band structure of armchair graphene nanoribbons via control electrodes, arranged periodically along the extended direction of the nanoribbon. This addresses a key mechanism for dephasing in solids, which derives from the momentum dependence of the energy gap between the valence and the conduction band. We design an optimal driving field pulse to produce collective Rabi oscillations between these bands, in their flattened configuration. As an example for coherent control, we show that these optimized pulses can be used to invert the entire electronic band population by a $\pi$ pulse in a reversible fashion, and to create a superposition state via a $\pi/2$ pulse, which generates an alternating photocurrent. Our proposal consists of a platform and methodological approach to optically control the electron dynamics of graphene nanoribbons, paving the way toward novel coherent electronic and quantum information processing devices in solid-state materials.</p>

            <h2>Theory of non-resonant Raman scattering from electrons in nodal and flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Predrag Nikolić</p>
            <p>Raman scattering is emerging as a surprising probe of electron topology in quantum materials. It has been used recently to detect and characterize a topological phase transition that accompanies the magnetic transition in Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Here we present a theory of Raman scattering from nodal electrons with Weyl and quadratic band touching spectra, which has to reach beyond the standard effective mass approximation. After reviewing and providing the details of our previous theory development, we discuss several new results. We show that the light-polarization dependence of Raman scattering is universal in the case of Weyl electrons and given by an analytic expression, while it contains symmetry-protected features in the case of quadratic band-touching nodes. We also analyze modifications of the Raman signal due to the ubiquitous tilting of the Weyl spectrum, and argue that universality is lost only in a finite frequency range that springs out of the threshold frequency for untilted nodes. Finally, we explore the frequency dependence of Raman scattering for the case of Dirac electrons coexisting with a flat band in the same region of the first Brillouin zone, which is inspired by the material V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Light-induced pseudo-magnetic fields in three-dimensional topological semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpit Raj, Swati Chaudhary, Martin Rodriguez-Vega, Maia G. Vergniory, Roni Ilan, Gregory A. Fiete</p>
            <p>In this work, we show that suitably designed spatially varying linearly polarized light provides a versatile route to generate and control pseudo-magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals through Floquet engineering. Within a high-frequency expansion, we derive an effective axial gauge potential $\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$ whose curl gives the pseudo-magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_5(\mathbf{r})$. By mapping the light profile to $\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$, we establish design principles for pseudo-magnetic field textures that mimic strain-induced gauge fields while offering key advantages like dynamic control, full reversibility, spatial selectivity, and absence of material deformation. We compare the Landau-level spectra produced by uniform real and pseudo-magnetic fields and also analyze both their linear optical conductivity and the second-order dc responses. Our results enable real-time manipulation of pseudo-magnetic fields and predict clear experimental signatures for optically engineered gauge fields in topological semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Hidden integer quantum ferroelectricity in chiral Tellurium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Luo, Sihan Deng, Muting Xie, Junyi Ji, Hongjun Xiang, Laurent Bellaiche</p>
            <p>Ferroelectricity is a cornerstone of functional materials research, enabling diverse technologies from non-volatile memory to optoelectronics. Recently, type-I integer quantum ferroelectricity (IQFE), unconstrained by symmetry, has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated; however, as it arises from ionic displacements of an integer lattice vector, the initial and final states are macroscopically indistinguishable, rendering the physical properties unchanged. Here, we propose for the first time the nontrivial counterpart (i.e., type-II IQFE) where the polarization difference between the initial and final states is quantized but the macroscopical properties differ. We further demonstrate the existence of type-II IQFE in bulk chiral tellurium. In few-layer tellurium, the total polarization remains nearly quantized, composed of a bulk-inherited quantum component and a small surface-induced contribution. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal surface-initiated, layer-by-layer switching driven by reduced energy barriers, explaining why ferroelectricity was observed experimentally in few-layer tellurium, but not in bulk tellurium yet. Interestingly, the chirality of the initial and final states in bulk tellurium is opposite, suggesting a novel way to control structural chirality with electric field in chiral photonics and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory devices.</p>

            <h2>High-Throughput Screening of Transition Metal-Based 2D Multilayer Kagome Materials via the "1 + 3" Design Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Yu Wang, En-Qi Bao, Su-Yang Shen, Jun-Hui Yuan, Jiafu Wang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials have drawn extensive research interest due to their unique electronic properties, like flat bands, magnetic frustration, and topological quantum states, which enable precise quantum state control and novel device innovation. Yet, simultaneously achieving high stability, tunability, and multifunctionality in 2D kagome systems remains a key material design challenge. In this study, we innovatively propose a new paradigm for constructing two-dimensional multi-kagome-layer materials based on the "1+3" design concept. By seamlessly integrating high-throughput screening techniques, we have successfully identified 6,379 novel 2D multilayer kagome candidates from a vast pool of candidates. These materials exhibit a rich diversity of types, encompassing 173 metals, 27 semimetals, 166 ferromagnetic semiconductors, and as many as 6,013 semiconductors. Furthermore, based on the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, we conducted a detailed analysis of the flat-band characteristics of the energy bands near the Fermi level in the predicted systems. Our findings reveal that approximately two-thirds of the systems meet the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, and notably, several systems exhibit nearly perfect flat-band characteristics. Our work provides an excellent paradigm for the design and research of 2D multilayer kagome materials</p>

            <h2>Chern insulators and topological flat bands in cavity-embedded kagome systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hikaru Goto, Ryo Okugawa, Takami Tohyama</p>
            <p>We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a low-energy effective tight-binding model.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the parametric modulation of a double quantum dot charge dipole coupled to a cavity, at the cavity frequency, achieving an amplified readout signal compared to conventional dispersive protocols. Our findings show that the observed cavity field displacement originates from dipole radiation within the cavity, rather than from a longitudinal coupling mechanism, yet exhibits the same signatures while relying on a transverse coupling. By carefully tuning the phase and amplitude of the intra-cavity field, we achieve a $\pi$-phase shift between two dipole states, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to its applications in quantum dot based qubits in cQED architectures, this protocol could serve as a new promising tool for probing exotic electronic states in mesoscopic circuits embedded in cavities.</p>

            <h2>Quantum fluctuation-induced first-order breaking of time-reversal symmetry in unconventional superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yin Shi</p>
            <p>Spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors with competing non-degenerate pairing channels is an exotic quantum phase transition that could give rise to robust topological superconductivity and unusual magnetism. It is proposed mostly in two-dimensional systems and is signaled by a nonzero relative phase between the two superconducting order parameters, hence it should particularly be prone to order-parameter phase fluctuations. Nevertheless, the existing understanding of it is still at the mean-field level. Here, we illustrate the non-negligible effects of the phase fluctuations on such quantum phase transitions using the hole-doped square-lattice $t$-$J$ model as an example. We derive the phase fluctuation-corrected free energy and show that under the quantum phase fluctuations, the time-reversal asymmetric $s+id$ phase region splits off a dome featuring a first-order border with the $d$ phase, indicating the possibility of a phase separation into the time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric phases. The phase fluctuations also narrow the range of the $s+id$ phase considerably. We further discuss the implications of our findings for recent experiments on disorder-induced first-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity and promising high-temperature topological superconductivity in twisted cuprate Josephson junctions.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Chern Insulator States with Coexisting Magnonic and Electronic Topology in 2D Honeycomb Kitaev Ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haozhou Cai, Zhiming Xu, Jian Wu, Weiyi Pan</p>
            <p>The coexistence of topological magnons and electrons in magnetic materials presents a compelling route toward developing low-dissipation, multifunctional spintronic devices. However, material systems enabling their simultaneous realization and control remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose the coexistence and concurrent tunability of magnonic and electronic Chern insulator phases in Kitaev magnets and use MnBr$_{3}$ monolayer as a prototype. We find the significant Kitaev interaction in MnBr$_{3}$ induces the magnonic Chern insulator phase, manifesting as the magnon thermal Hall effect. Concurrently, MnBr$_{3}$ exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect driven by its electronic Chern insulator phase. Crucially, we demonstrate that these dual topological phases can be simultaneously controlled by reorienting the in-plane spins with an external magnetic field. Our findings not only deepen the fundamental understanding of spin excitations in Kitaev magnets but also provide a promising platform for exploring the interplay between electronic and magnonic topology.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Materials for Quantum Magnonics</h2>

            <p>Quantum magnonics studies the quantum properties of magnons, the quanta of spin waves, and their application in quantum information processing. Progress in this field depends on identifying magnetic materials with characteristics tailored to the diverse requirements of magnonics and quantum magnonics. For single-magnon excitation, its control, hybrid coupling, and entanglement, the most critical property is the ability to support long magnon lifetimes. This perspective reviews established and emerging magnetic materials, including ferromagnetic metals, Heusler compounds, antiferromagnets, altermagnets, organic and 2D van der Waals magnets, hexaferrites, and in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG), highlighting their key characteristics. YIG remains the benchmark, with bulk crystals supporting sub-microsecond Kittel-mode lifetimes and ultra-pure spheres achieving $\sim18\,\mu$s for dipolar-exchange magnons at millikelvin temperatures. However, thin YIG films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates suffer from severe lifetime reduction due to substrate-induced losses. In contrast, YIG films on a new lattice matched, diamagnetic alternative, yttrium scandium gallium/aluminum garnet (YSGAG), overcomes these limitations and preserves low magnetic damping down to millikelvin temperatures. These advances provide a practical pathway toward ultralong-living magnons in thin films, enabling scalable quantum magnonics with coherent transport, strong magnon-photon, magnon-qubit coupling, and integrated quantum networks.</p>

            <h2>Configurational Entropy-Driven Phase Stability and Thermal Transport in Rock-Salt High-Entropy Oxides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutosh Kumar, Adrien Moll, Jitendra Kumar, Diana Dragoe, David Bérardan, Nita Dragoe</p>
            <p>High-entropy oxides (HEOs) offer a unique platform for exploring the thermodynamic interaction between configurational entropy and enthalpy in stabilizing complex solid solutions. In this study, a series of rock-salt structured oxides with varying configurational entropy, ranging from binary to multi-cation systems, to elucidate the competing roles of enthalpy and entropy in phase stabilization is investigated. Compositions including (Ni$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)O to(NiCuZnCoMg)$_{0.9}$A$_{0.1}$O (A = Li, Na, K) were synthesized and their stuctural, microstructural and thermal properties have been discussed. X-ray diffraction combined with thermal cycling confirms that even a medium configurational entropy ($\sim$ 0.95R) can induce single-phase behavior stabilized by configurational entropy ($\Delta S_{conf}$), challenging the traditional threshold of $1.5\,R$. High-resolution TEM and EDS mapping reveal nanocrytalline features and homogeneous elemental distribution respectively, while XPS analysis confirms divalent oxidation states. A strong coupling between high configurational entropy with thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) has been observed. First, a sharp decrease in $\kappa$ with increasing $\Delta S_{conf}$ is seen and then decomposed samples (while cooling) show high $\kappa$, demonstrating the role of $\Delta S_{conf}$ on $\kappa$. Furthermore, Li-doped compositions exhibit improved thermoelectric performance, with a maximum figure of merit ($zT$) of $\sim$0.15 at 1173K\, driven by low thermal conductivity and favorable carrier transport. The results highlight that configurational entropy, even at intermediate values, plays a significant role in stabilizing disordered single-phase oxides and tailoring phonon transport.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Open Systems: Emergence of Exceptional Points in Excitonic Spectra from First Principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenlin Zhang, Wei Hu, Enrico Perfetto, Gianluca Stefanucci</p>
            <p>In open quantum systems hosting excitons, dissipation mechanisms critically shape the excitonic dynamics, band-structure and topological properties. A microscopic understanding of excitons in such non-Hermitian settings demands a first-principles generalization of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Building on a recently introduced nonequilibrium Green's function formalism compatible with Lindbladian dynamics, we derive a non-Hermitian BSE from diagrammatic perturbation theory on the Keldysh contour, and obtain a microscopic excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates dissipation while preserving causality. We apply the formalism to valley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides coupled to structured photon baths. We uncover a rich landscape of exceptional points in momentum space, forming either discrete sets or continuous manifolds, depending on bath structure. The exceptional points give rise to nonanalytic valley-polarization, unusual polarization pattern in photoluminescence, and nontrivial topological signatures. Our results establish a first-principles framework for predicting and controlling excitonic behavior in open quantum materials, showing how engineered environments can be leveraged to induce and manipulate non-Hermitian and topological properties.</p>

            <p>While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.</p>

            <p>Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, yet a major gap persists between complex, data-hungry deep learning models and the practical demands of state-of-the-art scientific measurements. To fundamentally bridge this gap, we propose deep prior-based denoising, a robust deep learning model that requires no training data. We demonstrate its effectiveness by removing grid artifacts in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a long-standing and critical data analysis challenge in materials science. Our results demonstrate that deep prior-based denoising yields clearer ARPES images in a fraction of the time required by conventional, experiment-based denoising methods. This ultra-efficient approach to ARPES will enable high-speed, high-resolution three-dimensional band structure mapping in momentum space, thereby dramatically accelerating our understanding of microscopic electronic structures of materials. Beyond ARPES, deep prior-based denoising represents a versatile tool that could become a new standard in any advanced scientific measurement fields where data acquisition is limited.</p>

These diradicals comprise trityl groups meta-linked via pyridyl or phenyl groups, enabling optically bright triplet-to-triplet and singlet-to-singlet transitions. At room temperature, we observe optically detected magnetic resonance in these systems at zero magnetic field and a strong magneto-photoluminescence (10% modulation at 2 mT applied magnetic field). Distinct photoluminescence bands (at 630 nm and 700 nm) show opposite-sign spin-optical responses, arising from spin-selective intersystem crossing between triplet and singlet manifolds. These bright, all-organic diradicals offer a new set of chemically tunable materials for room temperature spin-optical interfaces, paving the way for application as quantum sensors.</p>

To realize their potential, novel experimental approaches need to be developed to characterize the combined materials and their components. Techniques using fast electrons, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), probe phenomena over an unrivaled energy range with high resolution. In addition, momentum-resolved EELS simultaneously records energy and momentum transfer to the sample and thus generates two-dimensional data sets for each beam position. This allows excitations that occur at large momentum transfer to be resolved, including those outside of the light cone and beyond the first Brillouin zone, all whilst retaining nanometer sized spatial selectivity. Such capabilities are particularly important when probing phonons, plasmons, excitons and their coupling in 2D materials and their heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) is a key technique for characterizing nonlinear viscoelasticity in a wide range of materials. Most research to date has focused on the shear stress response to an oscillatory strain input. However, for highly elastic materials such as polymer melts, the time-varying first normal stress difference $N_1(t;\omega,\gamma_0)$ can become much larger than the shear stress at sufficiently large strains, serving as a sensitive probe of the material's nonlinear characteristics. We present a Fourier-Tschebyshev framework for decomposing the higher-order spectral content of the $N_1$ material functions generated in LAOS. This new decomposition is first illustrated through analysis of the second-order and fourth-order responses of the quasilinear Upper Convected Maxwell model and the fully nonlinear Giesekus model. We then use this new framework to analyze experimental data on a viscoelastic silicone polymer and a thermoplastic polyurethane melt. Furthermore, we couple this decomposition with the recently developed Gaborheometry strain sweep technique to enable rapid and quantitative determination of the $N_1$ material function from experimental normal force data obtained in a single sweep from small to large strain amplitudes. We verify that asymptotic connections between the oscillatory shear stress and $N_1$ in the quasilinear limit are satisfied for the experimental data, ensuring self-consistency. This framework for analyzing the first normal stress difference is complementary to the established framework for analyzing the shear stresses in LAOS, and augments the content of material-specific data sets, hence more fully quantifying the important nonlinear viscoelastic properties of a wide range of soft materials.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate the existence of a frequency band exhibiting acoustic transparency in 2D and 3D dense granular suspensions, enabling the transmission of a low-frequency ballistic wave excited by a high-frequency broadband ultrasound pulse. This phenomenon is attributed to spatial correlations in the structural disorder of the medium. To support this interpretation, we use an existing model that incorporates such correlations via the structure factor. Its predictions are shown to agree well with those of the Generalized Coherent Potential Approximation (GCPA) model, which is known to apply at high volume fractions, including the close packing limit, but does not explicitly account for disorder correlation. Within the transparency band, attenuation is found to be dominated by absorption rather than scattering. Measurements of the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient reveal significant deviations from conventional models, challenging the current understanding of acoustic absorption in dense granular media.</p>

            <p>Mechanical metamaterials enable unconventional and programmable mechanical responses through structural design rather than material composition. In this work, we introduce a multistable mechanical metamaterial that exhibits a toggleable stiffness effect, where the effective shear stiffness switches discretely between stable configurations. The mechanical analysis of surrogate beam models of the unit cell reveal that this behavior originates from the rotation transmitted by the support beams to the curved beam, which governs the balance between bending and axial deformation. The stiffness ratio between the two states of the unit cell can be tuned by varying the slenderness of the support beams or by incorporating localized hinges that modulate rotational transfer. Experiments on 3D-printed prototypes validate the numerical predictions, confirming consistent stiffness toggling across different geometries. Finally, we demonstrate a monolithic soft clutch that leverages this effect to achieve programmable, stepwise stiffness modulation. This work establishes a design strategy for toggleable stiffness using multistable metamaterials, paving the way for adaptive, lightweight, and autonomous systems in soft robotics and smart structures.</p>

            <p>Platinum, to date, is the most widely applied electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It is assumed to be a proton-blocking catalyst with only surface-limited adsorption of the reaction intermediates. Here, we critically evaluate the bulk interaction of Pt with hydrogen (H), and its heavier isotope deuterium (D), by monitoring operando mass change of the Pt electrode during galvanostatic heavy/water splitting by employing an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Unexpectedly, we observe an irreversible temporal mass gain and a change in the reaction's overpotential, arising from diffusion of H/D into Pt, confirmed by atom probe tomography and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Sub-surface concentration of at least ca. 15 at. % of D in Pt was observed, diffusing down to a depth of more than 10 nm. Analytical description quantified the diffusion coefficient of D in Pt to be 3.2X10^-18 cm2Xs-1. These findings challenge the existing credence of Pt-proton interaction being limited to the surface, prompting the expansion of the catalyst design strategies to account for property-modifying bulk diffusion of H/D in the Pt matrix</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Scali, Marco Finazzi, Federico Bottegoni, Carlo Zucchetti</p>
            <p>Optical orientation has been proven as a powerful tool to inject spin-polarized electron and hole populations in III-V and group-IV semiconductors. In particular, the absorption of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge generates a spin-oriented population of electrons in the conduction band with a spin-polarization up to 50%, whereas the hole spin-polarization, opposite to the electron one, can even reach values up to 83%. In this letter, we theoretically investigate the optical injection of orbital polarization by means of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge and we show that the latter considerably exceeds 100% for holes and photon energies close to the direct Ge gap. These results suggest that Ge is a convenient platform for future development of orbitronics and opto-orbitronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chhatra Bahadur Subba, Bhanu Chettri, Amel Laref, Zeesham Abbas, Amna Parveen, Dibya Prakash Rai, Zaithanzauva Pachuau</p>
            <p>The development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for clean energy conversion remains a central challenge in materials science. Although platinum serves as the benchmark catalyst, its scarcity and high cost hinder large-scale deployment. In this study, we propose a newly predicted SnSiGeN4 MXene-family monolayer as a promising candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated its electronic, vibrational, and optical properties across multiple exchange-correlation functionals, including hybrid approaches, revealing a wide and tunable band gap. Simulated infrared and Raman spectra further confirm the dynamical stability and the presence of catalytically active sites. Guided by these findings, we studied photocatalytic reaction analyses that demonstrate that the computed overpotentials for OER, ORR, and HER are comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts and outperform Ir-based systems, positioning SnSiGeN4 as a sustainable, high-performance platform for next-generation UV-visible-light-driven photocatalysis.</p>

            <p>Rhombohedral graphene (rG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been shown to host flat bands that stabilize various strongly correlated quantum phases, including Mott insulators, integer, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases. In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to visualize the dispersion of flat bands with doping and applied displacement fields in a hBN-aligned rhombohedral trilayer graphene (rtG)/hBN moiré superlattice. In addition to the intrinsic flat bands of rtG induced by the displacement field, we observe low-energy features originating from moiré potential-induced band folding. Real-space variations of the spectroscopic features allow us to quantify the spatial structure of the moiré potential at the rtG/hBN interface. Importantly, we find that accurately capturing the moiré site-dependent spectra requires incorporating a moiré potential acting on the top graphene layer with a sign opposite to that of the bottom layer into the continuum model. Our results thus provide key experimental and theoretical insights into understanding the role of the moire superlattice in rG/hBN heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Behzad Mortezapour, Sebastian Hamer, Rainer Herges, Roberto Robles, Richard Berndt</p>
            <p>We investigated trioxatriangulenium functionalized with phenyl (phenyl-TOTA) on the (111) surfaces of Ag and Au using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). On Ag(111), the molecules form hexagonal arrays, and on Au(111), honeycomb patterns are also observed. The orientations of the phenyl moieties are resolved on both substrates. On Ag(111), the orientations are parallel within a row and they differ by approximately $60^\circ$ between adjacent molecular rows, and STM images suggest dimerization of the molecules. DFT calculations for Ag(111) reveal that van der Waals interactions dominate this system. The optimized structure matches the experimental pattern, and the simulated STM images exhibit apparent dimerization. This dimerization results from an asymmetry of the phenyl wavefunction, which reflects intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the ligand and an oxygen atom within the triangulenium platform. The orientation of the phenyl moieties is explained by the interaction of each phenyl moiety with its triangulenium platform combined with the direct long-range interaction between phenyl moieties across molecules.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor photocatalysis offers a sustainable route for converting solar energy into chemical energy, enabling the production of clean fuels and valuable chemical products. To this aim, we explore van der Waals heterostructures made up of Janus PtSSe and WXY (X, Y $=$ S, Se, Te and X $\neq$Y), in the context of photocatalytic applications. The redox capabilities of various heterostructure configurations (atom facing types and stacking orders) are evaluated by aligning the absolute band edge positions with respect to redox potentials of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. The stability of photocatalyst candidates are checked by layer binding energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The optical absorption spectra suggest good light absorption in the visible range. Further, strain engineering is applied as a way to tune band edges and evaluate the possible use of the heterostructures as photocatalysts. This study shows that van der Waals heterostructure bilayers composed of Janus PtSSe and WSeTe in specific geometric configurations can be potential materials as photocatalysts for HER, OER and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. Finally, we suggest that, although systems made up of PtSSe and WSTe cannot be used for photocatalytic applications, they can be explored for applications in thermoelectric energy conversion or infrared photovoltaics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Lopez, Sébastien Fumeron, Malte Henkel, Trifce Sandev, Esther D. Gutiérrez</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</p>

            <p>In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty -- particularly an agent's tolerance for risk -- determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a Rényi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</p>

            <h2>Interlaced dynamic XCT reconstruction with spatio-temporal implicit neural representations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathias Boulanger, Ericmoore Jossou</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the use of spatio-temporalImplicit Neural Representations (INRs) for dynamic X-ray computed tomography (XCT) reconstruction under interlaced acquisition schemes. The proposed approach combines ADMM-based optimization with INCODE, a conditioning framework incorporating prior knowledge, to enable efficient convergence. We evaluate our method under diverse acquisition scenarios, varying the severity of global undersampling, spatial complexity (quantified via spatial information), and noise levels. Across all settings, our model achieves strong performance and outperforms Time-Interlaced Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (TIMBIR), a state-of-the-art model-based iterative method. In particular, we show that the inductive bias of the INR provides good robustness to moderate noise levels, and that introducing explicit noise modeling through a weighted least squares data fidelity term significantly improves performance in more challenging regimes. The final part of this work explores extensions toward a practical reconstruction framework. We demonstrate the modularity of our approach by explicitly modeling detector non-idealities, incorporating ring artifact correction directly within the reconstruction process. Additionally, we present a proof-of-concept 4D volumetric reconstruction by jointly optimizing over batched axial slices, an approach which opens up the possibilities for massive parallelization, a critical feature for processing large-scale datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emilio Rui, Joachim Cohen, Alexandru Petrescu</p>
            <p>We present a nonperturbative tensor-network approach to the excitation spectra of superconducting circuits based on Josephson junction arrays. These arrays provide the large lumped inductances required for qubit designs, yet their intrinsically many-body nature is typically reduced to effective single-mode descriptions. Perturbative treatments attempt to include the collective array modes neglected in these approximations, but a fully nonperturbative analysis is challenging due to the many-body structure and the collective character of these modes. We overcome this difficulty using the DMRG-X algorithm, which extends tensor-network methods to excited states. Our key advance is a construction of trial states from the linearized mode structure, enabling direct computation of excitations, even in degenerate manifolds, which was previously inaccessible. Our results reveal significant deviations from, and allow us to improve upon, previous perturbative treatments in the regime of low array junction impedance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. J. R. Bezerra Jr., W. S. Dias</p>
            <p>We investigate the modulational instability of uniform wave packets governed by a discrete third-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation in finite square lattices, modeling light propagation in two-dimensional nonlinear waveguide arrays. We analyze how initially stable uniform distributions evolve into self-trapped (localized) regimes and the influence of a refractive index detuning selectively applied along the diagonal waveguides on this transition. This detuning effectively emulates the effect of on-site Hubbard-like interactions $U$ in photonic analogs of interacting particles in a one-dimensional lattice. While for $U = 0$ the system exhibits the known direct transition from stable uniform states to asymptotically localized profiles, we show that $U > 0$ induces an emergence of intermediate dynamical regimes. These regimes include coherent breathing modes that can be either confined along diagonal or off-diagonal waveguides, as well as chaotic-like propagation patterns. At higher nonlinearities, we identify distinct self-trapped regimes characterized by diagonal or off-diagonal localized modes, depending on the strength of $U$. The critical nonlinear strengths separating the existing regimes are shown in the phase diagram, underscoring the competing trends imposed by the Hubbard-like interaction on the optical field.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermiticity naturally arises in many physical systems that exchange energy with their environment. The presence of non-Hermiticity leads to many novel topological physics phenomena and device applications. In the non-Hermitian energy band theory, the foundation of these physics and applications, both energies and wavevectors can take complex values. The energy bands thus become a Riemann surface, and such an energy-band Riemann surface underlies all the important signatures of non-Hermitian topological physics phenomena. Despite a long history and recent theoretical interests, the energy-band Riemann surface has not been experimentally studied. Here we provide a photonic observation of the energy-band Riemann surface of a non-Hermitian system. This is achieved by applying a tunable imaginary gauge transformation on the platform of the photonic synthetic frequency dimension. From the measured topology of the Riemann surface, we reveal the complex-energy winding, the open-boundary-condition spectrum, the generalized Brillouin zone, and the branch points. Our findings demonstrate a unified framework in the studies of diverse effects in non-Hermitian topological physics through an experimental observation of energy-band Riemann surfaces.</p>

            <p>Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show (1) the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarized excitation, and (2) the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarized illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. Both effects are accompanied by hybridized near-fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarization, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.</p>

            <p>The storage of large-scale quantum information at finite temperature requires an autonomous and reliable quantum hard drive, also known as a self-correcting quantum memory. It is a long-standing open problem to find a self-correcting quantum memory in three dimensions. The recently introduced Layer Codes achieve the best possible scaling of code parameters and logical energy barrier in three dimensions, these are tantalizing features for the purposes of self-correction. In this work we show that a family of Layer Codes, based on good Quantum Tanner Codes, exhibit partial self-correction. Their memory time grows exponentially with linear system size, up to a length scale that is exponential in the inverse temperature. At this length scale, the memory time scales as a double exponential of inverse temperature. To establish this result we introduce a concatenated matching decoder that combines three rounds of parallelized minimum-weight perfect-matching with a decoder for good Quantum Tanner Codes. We show that our decoder corrects errors up to a constant fraction of the energy barrier, and a constant fraction of the code distance, for a family of Layer Codes. Our results position Layer Codes as the leading candidate for a partially self-correcting memory in three dimensions. While they fall short of achieving strict self-correction in the thermodynamic limit, our work highlights the potential of these local codes in three dimensions, with fast distance and logical qubit growth, fast decoders, and a long memory time over a wide range of parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanlin Sun, Filippo Radicchi, Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</p>

            <p>On-chip optical architectures that enable angle-resolved spectroscopy are essential for advancing photonic platforms towards low-volume, scalable, and cryo-compatible devices. Here, we introduce spatially resolved momentum-space imaging using arrays of 3D-printed microlenses directly integrated onto semiconductor optical microcavities. Each microlens functions as an independent optical element with a high numerical aperture (approx. 0.95), enabling parallel back focal plane imaging across, in our implementation, 64 distinct locations. This approach eliminates the need for bulky microscope objectives while maintaining broad wavevector access, even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate its versatility across various cavity systems, including dielectric planar resonators, GaAs-based polariton microcavities, and CdTe platforms supporting nonequilibrium Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons. The microlenses not only enhance collection efficiency but also enable tightly focused excitation, yielding an order of magnitude reduction in condensation thresholds compared with conventional setups.

            <p>Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.</p>

This is similar to what was used to locate the complex CFT of the 5-state Potts model in dimension $d=2$ [PRL 133 (2024) 077101]. There it was shown that a CFT is characterized by a stationarity condition for the measured effective central charge. Our strategy is to write the ground-state energy as $E_{\rm GS}(N)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] with good precision, and their sweet spot as well.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajath Radhakrishnan, Adar Sharon, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn</p>
            <p>Dynamical stabilizer codes (DSCs) have recently emerged as a powerful generalization of static stabilizer codes for quantum error correction, replacing a fixed stabilizer group with a sequence of non-commuting measurements. This dynamical structure unlocks new possibilities for fault tolerance but also introduces new challenges, as errors must now be tracked across both space and time. In this work, we provide a physical and topological understanding of DSCs by establishing a correspondence between qudit Pauli measurements and non-invertible symmetries in 4+1-dimensional 2-form gauge theories. Sequences of measurements in a DSC are mapped to a fusion of the operators implementing these non-invertible symmetries. We show that the error detectors of a DSC correspond to endable surface operators in the gauge theory, whose endpoints define line operators, and that detectable errors are precisely those surface operators that braid non-trivially with these lines. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework naturally recovers the spacetime stabilizer code associated with a DSC.</p>

            <p>We study active agents embedded in bulk or in confinement explicitly considering hydrodynamics and simulating the swimmers via an implementation inspired by the squirmer model. We develop a Dissipative Particle Dynamics scheme for the solvent. This approach allows us to properly deal not only with hydrodynamics but also with thermal fluctuations. On the other side, this approach enables us to study active agents with complex shapes, ranging from spherical colloids to polymers. To start with, we study a simple spherical colloid. We analyze the features of the velocity fields of the surrounding solvent, when the colloid is a pusher, a puller or a neutral swimmer either in bulk or confined in a cylindrical channel. Next, we characterise its dynamical behaviour by computing the mean square displacement and the long time diffusion when the active colloid is in bulk or in a channel (varying its radius) and analyze the orientation autocorrelation function in the latter case. While the three studied squirmer types are characterised by the same bulk diffusion, the cylindrical confinement considerably modulates the diffusion and the orientation autocorrelation function. Finally, we focus our attention on a more complex shape: an active polymer. We first characterise the structural features computing its radius of gyration when in bulk or in cylindrical confinement, and compare to known results obtained without hydrodynamics. Next, we characterise the dynamical behaviour of the active polymer by computing its mean square displacement and the long time diffusion. On the one hand, both diffusion and radius of gyration decrease due to the hydrodynamic interaction when the system is in bulk. On the other hand, the effect of confinement is to decrease the radius of gyration, disturbing the motion of the polymer and thus reducing its diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Terahertz Technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingda Zhang, Su Ying Quek</p>
            <p>Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first-principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with spin-triplet ground states and a zero-field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz (THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high-fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward the possibility of realising a single-photon THz emitter. This work broadens the scope of quantum defects, highlighting the opportunities for next generation THz quantum technologies - an area of growing interest given the rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.</p>

            <h2>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Preethi Gopalakrishnan, Shovan Dutta</p>
            <p>Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits forming a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining over 75000 networks of different families with tunable structural properties, we demonstrate that (i) heterogeneity in the number of neighbors is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) apart from the number of neighbors, the key determinant is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the frustration level. In fact, one can vary the magnetization throughout its range by embedding such hubs. We also discuss simple, exactly solvable networks where such tunability leads to both abrupt and continuous transitions, with quantum effects giving rise to a diverging susceptibility. Our findings can be realized on emerging platforms and pose a number of fundamental questions, strongly motivating wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena on complex networks.</p>

            <h2>Disorder operators in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through multidimensional bosonization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng</p>
            <p>Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We study the disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid with isotropic interactions scales asymptotically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$ being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then study models of the Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.</p>

            <h2>Nonmonotonic temperature behavior of magnetization and related functional properties in ordering Fe-rich Fe-Al alloys</h2>

            <p>The properties of alloys that undergo to chemical order-disorder transformations depend heavily on the degree of ordering in the crystal lattice. In particular, the ordering in a magnetic alloy like Fe-rich (x>0.5) Fe_xAl_1-x, for example, leads typically to reducing its magnetization and even to a transition from the ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) state at x<0.7. Our study was focused on the kinetics of ordering in thin Fe_xAl_1-x films of a nonstoichiometric composition (0.5<x<0.7). We demonstrate that, when the alloy is aged at a sufficiently high temperature, the formation of a chemically ordered structure is accompanied by an increase in magnetization and related functional properties, such as the anomalous Hall (AH) resistivity. We believe that these properties improve owing to the segregation of Fe and its precipitation outside the growing nuclei of the ordered B2-Fe_0.5Al_0.5 phase. The driving force for the Fe segregation we observe is associated with the squeezing out of excess Fe into the surrounding matrix by growing B2 nuclei. Simulations of the B2 nucleation process, performed using the molecular dynamics method, confirm our experimental findings. The results we report contrast to previous studies, which assumed that the growth of the B2 phase in alloys such as Fe_xAl_1-x (0.5<x<0.7) occurred through the mechanism of continuous ordering.</p>

            <h2>Effect of the Lattice-distortion on the Electronic Structure, Magnetic Anisotropy, and Hall Conductivities of the CoFeCrGa Spin Gapless Semiconductor: A First-Principles Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amar Kumar, Sujeet Chaudhary, Sharat Chandra</p>
            <p>Spin gapless semiconductors (SGSs), novel quantum materials, are notable for their tunable spin-transport properties. Considering that the SGS materials might have an invariably deformed lattice upon integration into devices, and given that the SGS nature is highly sensitive to external factors, the impact of lattice distortions on the different physical properties of CoFeCrGa SGS alloy has been investigated using density functional theory calculations. For lattice distortions, the uniform strain corresponding to $-6\% \leq \Delta V / V_0 \leq 6\% \quad (a: 5.60\text{-}5.83~\textÅ)$, and the tetragonal distortion corresponding to $0.8 \leq c/a \leq 1.2 \quad (a: 5.38\text{-}6.16~\textÅ,~c: 4.92\text{-}6.45~\textÅ)$ are modelled. All uniformly strained CoFeCrGa structures are found to display SGS character, magnetic isotropy, small anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), and small spin Hall conductivity (SHC) - closely resembling those of the ideal CoFeCrGa structure. In contrast, the tetragonally deformed structures display nearly half-metallic behavior with very high spin polarization, very large magnetic anisotropy ($ \sim 10^6~\mathrm{J/m^3}$), and very large AHC ranging from ($ -215 \text{ to } 250~\mathrm{S/cm} $) depending on the axial ratio of the distorted structure. The SHC, however, does not change significantly under tetragonal distortion and remains nearly of the same order as that of the Y-I ordered structure. In summary, these findings demonstrate that CoFeCrGa displays favorable spintronic properties even under lattice distortions, underscoring its potential for next-generation spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Zubeltzu, Fernando Bresme, Matthew Dawber, Marivi Fernandez-Serra, Emilio Artacho</p>
            <p>Recent experiments show that the relative dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of water confined to a film of nanometric thickness reaches a strikingly low value of 2.1, barely above the bulk's 1.8 value for the purely electronic response. We argue that $\epsilon$ is not a well-defined measure for dielectric properties at sub-nanometer scales due to the ambiguous definition of confinement width. Instead we propose the 2D polarizability $\alpha_{\perp}$ as the appropriate, well-defined response function whose magnitude can be directly obtained from both measurements and computations. Once the appropriate description is used, understanding the interplay between electronic and ionic contributions becomes critical, contrary to what is widely assumed. This highlights the importance of electronic degrees of freedom in interpreting the dielectric response of polar fluids under nanoconfinement conditions, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p>We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. We also present conjectures for universal scaling profiles for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau in a critical window. For free boundary conditions, the universal scaling has been proven to apply at a pseudocritical point for hierarchical spins, and we conjecture that this holds generally.</p>

            <p>We conjecture that the current fluctuations in one-dimensional driven transport systems obey an upper bound determined by the mean current and the driving force. This inequality originates from repulsive interactions between transporting particles, and the bound is approached both in near-equilibrium systems and in far-from-equilibrium systems with weak interactions. We first propose a coarse-grained model describing random particle exchanges between two reservoirs with constant rates, from which the upper bound emerges. We then rigorously prove the inequality in quantum ballistic transport systems. Finally, we demonstrate its validity in two specific diffusive systems: the exclusion process, for which the inequality can be proven, and charged-particle transport, for which numerical evidence supports the inequality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Gabriele, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco, Filomena Forte</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects in modern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations in momentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature. In this work, we investigate their interplay with high-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric materials, with an emphasis on even-order harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finite even-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotational symmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvature in systems with time-reversal invariance. This symmetry breaking can arise across various degrees of freedom and impact both spin textures and optical response via spin-orbit interactions. We also show that HHG is particularly sensitive to dynamical rotational-symmetry breaking, as even high-order components can be modulated by a time-dependent symmetry breaking. These findings underscore the potential of HHG as a tool for exploring electronic phases with broken rotational symmetry, as well as the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials, and provide novel perspectives for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical phenomena.</p>

            <p>We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$ index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain broader bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where the quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental bismuth realizing a nontrivial even spin-Chern number. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses and show their robustness in the presence of disorder within a real space marker formulation, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry is observable in realistic experimental settings of impure materials. Finally, we connect spin bounds to quantum Cramér-Rao bounds that are central to quantum metrology, showing that elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</p>

            <p>Quantum computation with electron spin qubits requires coherent and efficient manipulation of these spins, typically accomplished through the application of alternating magnetic or electric fields for electron spin resonance (ESR). In particular, electrical driving allows us to apply localized fields on the electrons, which benefits scale-up architectures. However, we have found that Electric Dipole Spin Resonance (EDSR) is insufficient for modeling the Rabi behavior in recent experimental studies. Therefore, we propose that the electron spin is being driven by a new method of electric spin qubit control which generalizes the spin dynamics by taking into account a quadrupolar contribution of the quantum dot: electric quadrupole spin resonance (EQSR). In this work, we explore the electric quadrupole driving of a quantum dot in silicon, specifically examining the cases of 5 and 13 electron occupancies.</p>

            <p>Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fréchet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.</p>

            <p>We present a scenario, in which a gapless extended phase serves as a "hub" connecting multiple symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum critical points. As a concrete example, we construct a lattice model with $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}$ symmetry for quantum spin-1/2 degrees of freedom that realizes four distinct gapful phases supporting antiferromagnetic long-range order and one extended incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. The quantum phase transition between any two of the four gapped and antiferromagnetic phases goes through either a (deconfined) quantum critical point, a quantum tricritical point, or the incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. In this phase diagram, it is possible to interpolate between four deconfined quantum critical points by passing through the extended gapless ferromagnetic phase. We identify the phases in the model and the nature of the transitions between them through a combination of analytical arguments and density matrix renormalization group studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeshi Mizushima, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>In superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, applying a magnetic field closes a trivial bulk gap and causes a topological phase transition (TPT), resulting in the emergence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of the wires. However, trivial Andreev bound states formed at the interface with metallic leads mimic the local Majorana properties, making it difficult to detect the TPT through local conductance measurements. In this work, we investigate the detection of the TPT by exploiting the static and dynamical density response of the hybrid system. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamical renormalized responses, the density response including the effect of Coulomb interactions, reveal the characteristic electronic structure and detect the TPT, which we then show to produce strong intensities of Raman scattering. Furthermore, we find that gapless plasmons emerge in the normal state, signaling the bulk Lifshitz transition. Our results thus predict that the bulk response of superconducting nanowires is a powerful spectroscopic approach to detect the bulk topological phase transition.</p>

            <p>Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to explicitly evaluate this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. In this paper, we describe the hierarchical autoregressive network (HAN) algorithm in three spatial dimensions and study its performance using the example of the Ising model. We compare HAN with three other autoregressive architectures and the classical Wolff cluster algorithm. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamic observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as entropy and free energy, in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.</p>

            <p>The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</p>

The electric polarization for the latter represents a new and distinguishable paradigm in materials science and physics because its electric polarization states embedded in the conduction electron sea are able to couple with (and controlled by) the external electric field. However, the microscopic polarization switching process and mechanism in these 2D vdW metallic materials have not been experimentally observed and remain elusive. Here, we report the first direct experimental imaging of the microscopic mechanism behind electric-field-coupled polarization switching in a metallic system. Our gate-tunable nanoscale optical imaging identifies the robust coexistence of electric polarization and appreciable carrier densities in adjacent polar domains hosting opposite electric polarizations in a 2D elemental metallic material, tetralayer graphene. We directly visualize and verify that the sliding domain wall (DW) solitons confined at the middlemost interface are responsible for the polarization switching in tetralayer graphene upon the application of electric fields and mechanical forces. Our work provides the first direct visualization of domain wall sliding-induced polarization switching in 2D elemental carbon at room temperature, significantly expanding and advancing the research of "ferroelectric metal" initially dubbed by P.

            <h2>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. I. Mukhin</p>
            <p>A theory is presented of a mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, based on the fact that 'nested' fermionic states near the Fermi surface of electrons/holes cause instability with respect to formation of the Q-balls (nontopological solitons) of coherently condensed spin/charge density wave fluctuations (SDW/CDW) with the wave-vector that matches the 'nesting' one. Simultaneously, the 'nested' fermions form superconducting condensate of Cooper/local pairs inside the Q-balls, with Q-ball SDW/CDW field being a 'pairing glue'. Thus, Q-balls possess lower total energy with respect to not condensed thermal SDW/CDW fluctuations and form a Q-balls 'gas' via first order phase transition below a temperature T$^*$. Besides, superconducting condensates inside the Q-balls induce a spectral gap on the nested parts of the Fermi surface, thus creating pseudogap phase. The Q-ball semiclassical field breaks chiral symmetry along the Matsubara time axis in Euclidean space-time possessing conserved Noether "charge" Q that makes the Q-ball volume finite. Prediction of the Q-ball scenario in cuprates is supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ in the pseudogap phase. The Q-balls of baryonic fields were originally predicted in Minkowski space-time by Sidney Coleman. In this paper it is demonstrated analytically that scattering of itinerant fermions on the Q-balls causes linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, that may explain famous 'Plankian' behavior in the 'strange metal' phase of high-Tc cuprates. Calculated diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas in the 'strange metal' phase and the phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates, with superconducting dome touching the 'strange metal' area at the optimal (holes)doping, are also in qualitative accord with experimental data.</p>

Using a microscopic model based on a modified Usadel equation incorporating those effects, we show that the size, shape, and position of these vortices can be controlled by manipulating Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the weak link, via gates, and we suggest that these vortices could be detected via scanning magnetometry techniques. We also show that the transverse triplet components of the pairing amplitudes can form a texture.</p>

            <p>Liquid electrolytes are critical components of next-generation energy storage systems, enabling fast ion transport, minimizing interfacial resistance, and ensuring electrochemical stability for long-term battery performance. However, measuring electrolyte properties and designing formulations remain experimentally and computationally expensive. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing liquid electrolyte formulation, integrating a forward predictive model with an inverse generative approach. Leveraging both computational and experimental data collected from literature and extensive molecular simulations, we train a predictive model capable of accurately estimating electrolyte properties from ionic conductivity to solvation structure. Our physics-informed architecture preserves permutation invariance and incorporates empirical dependencies on temperature and salt concentration, making it broadly applicable to property prediction tasks across molecular mixtures. Furthermore, we introduce -- to the best of our knowledge -- the first generative machine learning framework for molecular mixture design, demonstrated on electrolyte systems. This framework supports multi-condition-constrained generation, addressing the inherently multi-objective nature of materials design. As a proof of concept, we experimentally identified three liquid electrolytes with both high ionic conductivity and anion-concentrated solvation structure. This unified framework advances data-driven electrolyte design and can be readily extended to other complex chemical systems beyond electrolytes.</p>

In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.</p>

            <p>In a recent paper (Y. Ma and X. Cui, Phys. Rev.

The proposed structures are made of an outer shell of liquid (1,2) enveloping a spherical core of (2,3) liquid, which is claimed to be stable without the need of any trapping potential. I comment in the following that these structures are not actually the ground-states solutions to the system but rather local energy minima, and most likely impossible to realize in practice.</p>

            <p>Interlayer excitons in semiconducting bilayers separated by insulating hBN layers constitute a promising platform for investigation of strongly correlated bosonic phases. Here, we report an optical method for the generation and characterization of long-lived interlayer excitons. We confirm the presence of tightly bound interlayer excitons by measuring 1s and 2s intralayer excitons in each layer concurrently. Using a pump-probe technique, we find interlayer exciton lifetimes up to 8.8 $\mu$s, increasing with the thickness of the hBN. With optical access to long-lived interlayer excitons, our approach provides a new route to explore degenerate Bose--Fermi mixtures of excitons and itinerant electrons with high spatial and temporal resolution.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Modulated Symmetries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Ordered Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo M. Yoshitome, Heitor Casasola, Rodrigo Corso, Pedro R. S. Gomes</p>
            <p>We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Blom, Uwe Thiele, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>We construct dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for several cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. Only allowing for single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, only accounting for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Moreover, combining the different dynamics gives a large number of further models. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Cépas, G. Masbaum, P. Quémerais</p>
            <p>The Aubry transition is a phase transition between two types of incommensurate states, originally described as a transition by ``breaking of analyticity''. Here we present Denjoy's (anachronistic) viewpoint, who almost hundred years ago described certain mathematical properties of circle homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers. The connection between the two lies in the existence of a change of variables from the incommensurate ground state variables to new simple phase variables that rotate by a constant irrational angle. This confers a cyclic order, an essential property of models with the Aubry transition. Denjoy's description indicates that there are two types of cyclic order, distinguished by the regular or singular nature of the change of variables or, in mathematical terms, by the distinction between topological conjugacy versus semiconjugacy. This allows rephrasing the breaking of analyticity as a breaking of topological conjugacy. We illustrate this description with numerical calculations on the Frenkel-Kontorova model.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong Wu, Jia-Ji Zhu, Jian Li, Xue-Min Yang, Jiang-Shan Chen, Mu Zhou</p>
            <p>Dirac semimetals can be classified into types I, II, and III based on the topological charge of their Dirac points. If a three-dimensional (3D) system can be sliced into a family of kz-dependent normal and topological insulators, type I Dirac points separate a 2D normal insulator from a 2D first-order topological insulator, while type II (III) Dirac points separate a 2D normal (first-order) insulator from a 2D second-order topological insulator. To investigate the effects arising from the interplay of distinct Dirac points, one may wonder whether these Dirac points can coexist in a single system. Here, we propose a scheme to induce composite Dirac semimetals by a special Floquet driving that preserves time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. A general description is established to characterize Dirac semimetals in Floquet systems. The results show that Dirac semimetals hosting coexisting type I, II, and III Dirac points can be induced by delta-function or harmonic driving. Our results provide a promising new avenue for exploring novel Dirac semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. M. Beltukov, A. V. Rodina, A. Alekseev, Al. L. Efros</p>
            <p>Discontinuity of dielectric constants at the interface is a common feature of all nanostructures and semiconductor heterostructures. Near such interfaces, a charged particle creates a singular self-interaction potential which may be attributed to interaction with fictitious mirror charges. The singularity of this interaction at the interface presents an obstruction to a perturbative approach. In several limiting cases, this problem can be avoided by zeroing out the carrier wave function at the interface. In this paper, we have developed a non-perturbative theory which gives a self-consistent description of carrier propagation through an interface with a dielectric discontinuity. It is based on conservation of the current density propagating through the interface, and it is formulated in terms of general boundary conditions (GBC) for the wave function at the interface with a single phenomenological parameter W. For these GBC, we find exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation near the interface and the carrier energy spectrum including resonances. Using these results, we describe the photo effect at the semiconductor/vacuum interface and the energy spectrum of quantum wells (QWs) at the interface with the vacuum or a high-k dielectric. For a surface of liquid helium, we estimate the parameter W, and match the resulting electron spectrum with the existing experimental data and theoretical analysis.</p>

            <p>The nature of the phonon triplet in the region of OH-stretching modes in hydrogen-bonded materials is often explained by the interplay of OH-stretching modes and combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes. In order to elucidate the both contributions in KH$_2$PO$_4$ (KDP), we compare the pressure dependence of the OH-bending and stretching modes from ab initio calculation and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The ab initio calculation predicts a hardening of OH-bending modes and a softening of OH-stretching modes with pressure. At the same time, INS measurements in the region of OH-stretching modes indicate a hardening of the phonon triplet together with the bending modes. This means that this triplet in INS measurements is mainly due to combinations and overtones of OH-bending modes, while the intensity of OH-stretching modes appears to be relatively low. This conclusion may also apply to other hydrogen-bonded materials.</p>

            <p>Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--Hückel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is an intrinsic property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could help to explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wentao Yang, Zhaoru Sun</p>
            <p>Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</p>

            <p>In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile, reconfigurable storage devices. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals materials, where out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by relative in-plane sliding of adjacent layers. The intrinsic stacking order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples, thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration. This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe techniques.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic flux controlled current phase relationship in double Quantum Dot Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyan Wang, Cong Li, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>In this work, we study a Josephson junction with parallel-connected quantum dots (QDs) threaded by a magnetic flux in the central region. We discretize the superconducting (SC) electrode into three discrete energy levels and modify the tunneling coefficients to construct a finite-dimensional surrogate Hamiltonian. By directly diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we compute the physical quantities of the system. Additionally, we employ a low-energy effective model to gain deeper physical insight. Our findings reveal that when only one QD exhibits Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a phase transition between singlet and doublet states. The magnetic flux has a minor influence on the singlet state but significantly affects the doublet state. When both QDs have interactions, the system undergoes two phase transitions as the SC phase difference increases: the ground state evolves from a doublet to a singlet and finally into a triplet state at $\phi = \pi$. Increasing the magnetic flux suppresses the doublet and triplet phases, eventually stabilizing the singlet state. In this regime, enhancing the interaction strength does not induce a singlet-doublet transition but instead drives a transition between upper and lower singlet states, leading to a critical current peak as $U$ increases. Finally, we examine the case where the tunneling coefficient $\Gamma$ exceeds the SC pairing potential $\Delta$. Here, doublet states dominate, and the system only exhibits a phase transition between doublet and triplet states when $\phi_B = 0$. In the presence of a magnetic flux, the three states converge, resulting in a triple point in the ($\phi$, $\phi_B$) parameter space.</p>

            <p>We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</p>

            <p>Objective: This work aims to demonstrate a low-power, biomimetic auditory sensing concept for fully implantable cochlear implants. The approach draws inspiration from the frequency selectivity and temporal encoding of the cochlea, and uses neuromorphic spike generation to replace conventional signal processing blocks. The goal is to establish a compact, energy-efficient front-end architecture suitable for future implantable systems. Methods: An auditory sensing unit was implemented, consisting of a piezoelectric MEMS cantilever mechanically coupled to a single VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based oscillator. This configuration enables FFT-free, frequency-selective sensing and direct spike generation, forming a biomimetic auditory front end. The concept was experimentally examined using controlled mechanical excitation. Results: The sensing unit exhibited frequency-selective detection of mechanical vibrations in the nanometer to tens-of-nanometers displacement range and generated biomimetic spiking waveforms. Spike rate-encoding of the input amplitude was demonstrated, with output spiking frequencies tunable between approximately 100 Hz and 1 kHz depending on the excitation level. The waveform was finally converted to a biphasic shape suitable for cochlear implant stimulation. Significance: Temporal encoding is fundamental to natural auditory signal processing in the nervous system. By implementing this principle through neuromorphic spike encoding, the proposed approach can provide significant benefits for cochlear implants. In addition, the circuit has the potential to reduce footprint, energy consumption, and latencies compared with current commercial solutions.</p>

            <p>We explore the existence and dynamical generation of rogue waves (RWs) within a one dimensional quantum droplet bearing environment. RWs are computed by deploying a spacetime fixed point scheme to the relevant extended Gross Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). Parametric regions where the ensuing RWs are different from their counterparts in the nonlinear Schroedinger equation are identified. To corroborate the controllable generation, relevant to ultracold atom experiments, of these rogue patterns we exploit two different protocols. The first is based on interfering dam break flows emanating from Riemann initial conditions and the second refers to the gradient catastrophe of a spatially localized waveform. A multitude of possible RWs are found in this system, spanning waveforms reminiscent of the Peregrine soliton, its spatially periodic variants, namely, the Akhmediev breathers, and other higher order RW solutions of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Key elements of the shape of the corresponding eGPE RWs traced back to nonintegrability and the presence of competing interactions are discussed. Our results set the stage for probing a multitude of unexplored rogue like waveforms in such mixtures with competing interactions and should be accessible to current ultracold atom experiments.</p>

            <p>We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions.</p>

            <p>Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</p>

            <p>In this paper we show that a Brownian Gibbsian line ensemble whose top curve approximates a parabola must be given by the parabolic Airy line ensemble. More specifically, we prove that if $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} = (\mathcal{L}_1, \mathcal{L}_2, \ldots )$ is a line ensemble satisfying the Brownian Gibbs property, such that for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a constant $\mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) > 0$ with $$\mathbb{P} \Big[ \big| \mathcal{L}_1 (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2 \big| \le \varepsilon t^2 + \mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) \Big] \ge 1 - \varepsilon, \qquad \text{for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$},$$ then $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}$ is the parabolic Airy line ensemble, up to an independent affine shift. Specializing this result to the case when $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2$ is translation-invariant confirms a prediction of Okounkov and Sheffield from 2006 and Corwin-Hammond from 2014.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongliang Wang</p>
            <p>We derive the general circuit equations and system models directly from four Maxwell's equations and develop the electric-charge-based and magnetic-flux-based analysis methodologies to unify the analyses for both phase-independent circuits such as resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits and semiconductor transistor circuits, and phase-dependent circuits such as Josephson junction circuits and quantum-phase-slip (QPS) junction circuits. We invent the electric-charge-flow (ECF) diagram and the magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagram to abstract electric circuits into electric-charge-pump (ECP) networks and magnetic-flux-pump (MFP) networks, and visualize the dynamics of charge and flux distributions in electric circuits. The ECF and MFF diagrams are the graphic expressions of the system models of electric circuits, which can be directly simulated through solving general circuit equations. They are novel graphic languages for electromagnetic field-based circuit design and analysis.</p>

            <p>Signals of entanglement and nonlocality are quantitatively evaluated at zero and finite temperature in an analogue black hole realized in the flow of a quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The violation of Lorentz invariance inherent to this analog system opens the prospect to observe 3-mode quantum correlations and we study the corresponding violation of bipartite and tripartite Bell inequalities. It is shown that the long wavelength modes of the system are maximally entangled, in the sense that they realize a superposition of continuous variable versions of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states whose entanglement resists partial tracing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Juričić, Olivera Miskovic, Francisca Ramírez Carrasco</p>
            <p>We study torsional topological defects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in ($4+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the holographic interpretation, these correspond to crystalline dislocation defects associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling is fixed at the Chern-Simons point. By solving the equations of motion through an asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that the dual ($3+1$)-dimensional theory admits axially symmetric solutions. These solutions describe holographic materials with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded by a black hole in the bulk. At the same time, they feature ring-shaped defects arising from the background Riemann-Cartan geometry, characterized by nontrivial Burgers vectors. We also discuss the possible appearance of an odd-parity Abelian holographic anomaly, proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results motivate further studies of holographic defects using bulk gravitational theories and support the view that torsion provides a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexey Milekhin, Sara Murciano</p>
            <p>Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</p>

            <h2>Filtering out mislabeled training instances using black-box optimization and quantum annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Otsuka, Kento Kodama, Keisuke Morita, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
            <p>This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Asker, Mohamed Swailem, Uwe C. Täuber, Mauro Mobilia</p>
            <p>Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</p>

            <h2>Discrete time crystals in one-dimensional classical Floquet systems with nearest-neighbor interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo-Yi Li, Yu-Ran Zhang</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (PDTCs), an emergent non-equilibrium phase of matter, have been studied in two- and higher-dimensional lattices with nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions and one-dimensional (1D) lattices with long-range interactions. However, different from prethermalization that can be observed in 1D Floquet classical spin systems with NN interactions, classical PDTCs in Floquet 1D systems with only NN interactions have not been proposed before. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of disorder-free discrete time crystals (DTCs) in 1D Floquet classic spin systems with NN interactions. We show that the thermalization time first grows exponentially as the driving frequency increases and is then saturated, which depends on the energy density of the initial state. Since thermalization of the effective Hamiltonian is slow, there is no typical prethermalization and PDTCs in the Floquet system before final thermalization. The robustness of DTC order is verified by introducing imperfect spin flip operations. Our work provides an exploration of quantum characteristics, when considering the classical counterparts of quantum phenomena, and will be helpful for further investigations of both classical and quantum prethermal systems and discrete time-crystalline order</p>

            <p>We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art tensor networks are employed to simulate the Hamiltonian ramp in the analog-digital quantum simulation of the quantum phase transition to the quasi-long-range ordered phase of the two-dimensional square-lattice $XX$ model [T.I.

Using the infinite projected entangled pair state, we simulate an infinite lattice and demonstrate the KZ scaling hypothesis for the $XX$ correlations across a wide range of ramp times. We use the time-dependent variational principle algorithm to simulate a finite $8\times 8$ lattice, similar to the one in the quantum simulation, and find that adiabatic finite-size effects dominate for longer ramp times, where the correlation length's growth with increasing ramp time saturates and the excitation energy's dependence on the ramp time crosses over to a power-law decay characteristic of adiabatic transitions. This finding contradicts the quantum simulation data where the correlation length seems to obey KZ-like power laws, although with modified exponents.</p>

            <h2>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David E. Evans, Corey Jones</p>
            <p>We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the fixed point operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries on a tensor product quasi-local algebra if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an ``on-site" action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove two anomaly enforced gaplessness theorems, one for internal categorical symmetries and one for anomalous duality channels. Using the first, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exist gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Wolpert, Carlo Rovelli, Jordan Scharnhorst</p>
            <p>Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p>

Using exact diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter, by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing architectures.</p>

One of the most promising approaches is to replace aluminum with more performant materials. Within this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials are ideal candidates since they would allow to embed their unique properties into qubits. However, the realization of qubits based on vdW materials other than graphene is yet to be achieved. In this work we present a weakly anharmonic NbSe2 qubit. Our device exhibits a relaxation time T1 = 6.5 +\- 0.4 us which is roughly 2 orders of magnitude larger of other vdW qubits in addition to robustness to photon noise up to 5-10 thermal photons. Our work serves as a demonstrator of the advantage of integration of vdW materials into quantum technologies as well as serving as the first step toward the application of quantum non demolition photon detection protocols in the challenging field of dark matter search.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</p>

            <p>Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</p>

We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values.

            <p>To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for conventional air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is comparable to that of conventional dispatchable generators such as gas turbines. Furthermore, we show that a full Si-based TPV system, utilizing a 50-{\mu}m-thick air-bridge cell for enhanced photon utilization, can also achieve an LCOE that is competitive with such conventional power sources at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, despite its lower conversion efficiency relative to its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging the immense manufacturing scalability of Si, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</p>

            <p>Predicting the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of materials remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics due to the lack of a comprehensive and quantitative theory. We present a data-driven approach that combines chemistry-informed feature extraction with interpretable machine learning to predict $T_c$ and classify superconducting materials. We develop a systematic featurization scheme that integrates structural and elemental information through graphlet histograms and symmetry vectors. Using experimentally validated structural data from the 3DSC database, we construct a curated, featurized dataset and design a new kernel to incorporate histogram features into Gaussian-process (GP) regression and classification. This framework yields an interpretable $T_c$ predictor with an $ R^2$ value of 0.93 and a superconductor classifier with quantified uncertainties. Feature-significance analysis further reveals that GP $T_c$ predictor can achieve near-optimal performance only using four second-order graphlet features. In particular, we discovered a previously overlooked feature of electron affinity difference between neighboring atoms as a universally predictive descriptor. Our graphlet-histogram approach not only highlights bonding-related elemental descriptors as unexpectedly powerful predictors of superconductivity but also provides a broadly applicable framework for predictive modeling of diverse material properties.</p>

            <p>While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.</p>

            <h2>Measuring intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors using nonlinear response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-En Tseng, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>We discuss intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors, and how they may be measured using non-linear optical (terahertz) response. We consider both $s$ and $d$-wave superconductors, both with and without a phenomenological (energy dependent) damping. Intrinsic relaxation rates of interest include the Higgs mode decay rate, the quasiparticle redistribution rate ($1/T_1$) and the quasiparticle dephasing rate ($1/T_2$), where the latter two rates are zero in the pure BCS model, but non-zero in the presence of damping. Using the Anderson pseudospin formalism, we illustrate how these intrinsic relaxation rates are related to measurable quantities such as the time-dependent gap function and the non-linear current (a.k.a. third harmonic generation). Hence, we show how intrinsic relaxation rates may be experimentally extracted and discuss what one may thereby learn about the underlying damping. We also discuss the effects of polarization control (viz. non-linear response to light polarized in different directions), which offers a useful experimental knob, especially for $d$-wave superconductors, enabling selective excitation of modes in different irreducible representations (and readout of their corresponding relaxation rates).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Daniel Torres Luna, Sebastian Miles, A. Mert Bozkurt, Chun-Xiao Liu, Antonio L. R. Manesco, Anton R. Akhmerov, Michael Wimmer</p>
            <p>To observe Majorana bound states, and especially to use them as a qubit, requires careful optimization of competing quality metrics. We systematically compare Majorana quality in proximitized semiconductor nanowires and quantum dot chains. Using multi-objective optimization, we analyze the fundamental trade-offs between topological gap and localization length, two key metrics that determine MBS coherence and operational fidelity. We demonstrate that these quantities cannot be simultaneously optimized in realistic models, creating Pareto frontiers that define the achievable parameter space. Our results show that QD chains achieve both comparable quality as nanowires and a regime with a much shorter localization length, making them particularly promising for near-term quantum computing applications where device length and disorder are limiting factors.</p>

Josephson coupling of the weak links and electron density in the plaquettes are independently controlled by separate electrostatic gates. Applied magnetic flux results in an intricate pattern of switching currents associated with frustration, $f$. For depleted plaquettes, the switching current is nearly periodic in $f$, expected for a phase-only description, while occupied plaquettes yield a decreasing envelope of switching currents with increasing $f$. A model of flux dependence based on ballistic small-area junctions and diffusive large-area plaquettes yields excellent agreement with experiment.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware, physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally, we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost. Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the 4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical reservoir implementations across different material platforms.</p>

Our findings reveal that filtering isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching deuterium by separating it from protium.</p>

            <p>We systematically study the efficiency of the intrinsic superconducting diode effect of several pair-density-wave states that can emerge in two-dimensional $d$-wave metallic altermagnets. To this end, we investigate several scenarios using an effective minimal microscopic model and Ginzburg-Landau analysis in order to derive the corresponding pairing phase diagrams. In addition, we examine also whether the presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an applied external magnetic field are beneficial to this effect in these systems. As a consequence, our results add further support to the fact that altermagnetic materials indeed provide a good platform for the pursuit of finite-momentum superconductivity, which can lead to an optimization of the diode efficiency in some physically interesting situations. The latter phenomenon has been recently proposed to be key in improving the applicability of new energy-efficient quantum electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in the study of spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity arising from both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the chiral nature of dipolar interactions. In this paper, we examine how a nanowire with a crescent-shaped cross-section affects spin-wave propagation along its long axis when a bias magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the axis. Employing micromagnetic simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyze the effects of geometry and external magnetic field strength on the magnetization dynamics and spin-wave amplitude distribution. The results demonstrate that these factors modify the dispersion relation of spin waves and influence its nonreciprocity, which can vary depending on the mode type. This work advances the fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries and offers new perspectives for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dhruv C. Desai, Lauren A. Tan, Jin-Jian Zhou, Shiyu Peng, Jinsoo Park, Marco Bernardi</p>
            <p>Topological effects arising from the Berry curvature lead to intriguing transport signatures in quantum materials. Two such phenomena are the chiral anomaly and nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). A unified description of these transport regimes requires a quantitative treatment of both band topology and electron scattering. Here, we show accurate predictions of the magnetoresistance in topological semimetals and NLHE in noncentrosymmetric materials by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon ($e$-ph) scattering and Berry curvature computed from first principles. We apply our method to study magnetotransport in a prototypical Weyl semimetal, TaAs, and the NLHE in strained monolayer WSe$_2$, bilayer WTe$_2$ and bulk BaMnSb$_2$. In TaAs, we find a chiral contribution to the magnetoconductance which is positive and increases with magnetic field, consistent with experiments. We show that $e$-ph interactions can significantly modify the Berry curvature dipole and its dependence on temperature and Fermi level, highlighting the interplay of band topology and electronic interactions in nonlinear transport. The computed nonlinear Hall response in BaMnSb$_2$ is in agreement with experiments. By adding the Berry curvature to first-principles transport calculations, our work advances the quantitative analysis of a wide range of linear and nonlinear transport phenomena in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>In this work, we reveal a curious type of moiré effect that selectively modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moiré replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moiré period in the range of 25 Å to 80 Å by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moiré periods, we observe hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the moiré modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of surface states via moiré effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long Zhang, Guoying Gao</p>
            <p>Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Edge Excitations of Fractional Chern Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Han Yang, Ji-Yao Chen, Xiao-Yu Dong</p>
            <p>Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy. We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sirui Yu, Junrong Wang, Huajin Zhao, Hong Mao, Jinshuang Jin</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum transport in a hybrid ring system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) hosted in a topological superconducting nanowire, threaded by a magnetic flux. Utilizing the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance shows periodic behavior and its periodicity depends on both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian ($F = 0.5$), Poissonian ($F = 1$), and super-Poissonian ($F > 1$) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor ($F\gg1$) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise peak are degraded by thermal effects.</p>

            <p>We study the decoherence of a collection of Majorana zero modes weakly coupled to a gapless reservoir of non-interacting fermions. Using the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a Lindblad master equation for the dissipative dynamics of the Majorana zero modes. Due to the long-range coupling between Majorana zero modes mediated by the gapless reservoir, the Lindblad jump operators are non-local linear combinations of the Majorana operators. We show that, as a consequence, the dissipative dynamics can exhibit long relaxation times, i.e. a slow decay of fermion parities. A spectral analysis of the Liouvillian shows that the slow-down is suppressed as a power law of the distance between Majorana zero modes. Finally, we validate the Lindblad equation by comparison with unbiased numerical simulations of the time evolution of the full density matrix. In particular, these illustrate that non-Markovian dynamics establishes non-local correlations at small times.</p>

            <p>Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly this http URL and early experiments have already identified a wealth of emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge, and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore, rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the Néel temperature (T_N). We demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence. On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW magnetic semiconductors.</p>

            <p>Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices in twisted bilayers enable profound reconstructions of the electronic bandstructure, giving rise to correlated states with remarkable tunability. Extending this paradigm to van der Waals magnets, twisting creates spatially varying interlayer exchange interactions that stabilize emergent spin textures and the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of robust magnetic hysteresis in bilayer CrSBr upon twisting by an angle of ~ 3°. This is observed as the corresponding hysteretic evolution of the exciton energy, that directly correlates with the bilayer magnetic state, in magnetic field dependent photoluminescence measurements. A two-sublattice model captures this behavior, attributing it to the twist-induced reduction of interlayer exchange that stabilizes both parallel and antiparallel spin configurations across a broad field range. Comparison with experiment enables quantitative extraction of the effective exchange strength. Remarkably, the system exhibits coherent averaging across the moiré supercell, yielding an effective monodomain response characterized by switching into the antiferromagnetic state, rather than forming spin textures or fragmented domains. Spatially resolved measurements further uncover local variations in hysteresis loops, consistent with position-dependent modulation of the average exchange interaction. Our results establish twist engineering as a powerful route to programmable magnetic memories in two-dimensional magnets, harnessing the robustness of antiferromagnetic order.</p>

            <p>The theory of open quantum systems is one of the most essential tools for the development of quantum technologies. A particular area of interest is in the optical response of solid state systems, where dissipation is introduced phenomenologically through the relaxation time approximation and its effects are usually gauged perturbatively. Analytical exact results for driven systems under this approximation are scarce and tipically pertain only to the stationary regime. Here, we obtain the analytical solution for the current response of general single-band tight-binding system driven by a uniform electric field with generic time-dependence under the relaxation time approximation. We explore the effects of dissipation in two limiting cases: A monochromatic field, where we analytically deduce the effect of dissipation on High Harmonic Generation, and a constant electric field, where a generalization for the Esaki-Tsu equation is presented for any single-band tight-binding system. We specify the results for a simple 2D nearest neighbours tight-binding lattice to emphasize the effect of the scale competition introduced by the two different neighbours in both the monochromatic and constant field cases. Finally, we compare our exact result for the constant field to the one obtained from the usual perturbation theory calculation to probe the validity of the latter.</p>

            <p>Origami-inspired self-deployable structures offer lightweight, compact, and autonomous deployment capabilities, making them highly attractive for aerospace and defence applications, such as solar panels, antennas, and reflector systems. This paper presents finite element frameworks for simulating Miura-origami units in ABAQUS, focusing on two deployment mechanisms: elastic strain energy release and thermally activated shape-memory polymers (SMPs). Validation against experimental data for elastic deployment demonstrates that the model accurately captures fold trajectories and overall kinematics. Parametric studies reveal the influence of hinge stiffness and damping on deployment efficiency.

            <p>Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic. Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by Mølmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schrödinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.</p>

            <h2>Far-field radiation of bulk, edge and corner eigenmodes from a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger plasmonic lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Álvaro Buendía, José Luis Pura, Vincenzo Giannini, José Antonio Sánchez Gil</p>
            <p>Subwavelength arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles allow us to control the behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Here, we develop an eigenmode analysis, employing a coupled electromagnetic dipole formalism, which permits us to isolate the contribution to the far-field radiation of each array mode. Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes that all bulk $\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing array size.</p>

            <h2>Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes</h2>

            <p>Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (<10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</p>

            <p>NbRe is a non-centrosymmetric superconductor that has been proposed as a candidate for intrinsic spin-triplet pairing. However, a conclusive demonstration of triplet pairing in NbRe is yet to be found. To probe the presence of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs, we fabricated Py/NbRe/Py trilayers capped with an antiferromagnetic layer. Magnetic and electrical measurements reveal an inverse spin-valve effect, which could indicate equal-spin triplet superconductivity. The minimal sample structure and the lack of ad hoc engineered interfaces clearly associate our observation to intrinsic triplet correlations of NbRe. The availability of NbRe in thin-film form and the simplicity of the heterostructure highlight its potential as a scalable platform for superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Imran, Sikander Azam, Qaiser Rafiq, Amin Ur Rahman</p>
            <p>Perovskite oxides are promising for energy and quantum technologies, but wide-gap hosts such as NaAlO3 suffer from deep-UV absorption and limited carrier transport. Using first-principles GGA+U+SOC calculations, we investigate Eu3+-, Gd3+-, and Tb3+-doped NaAlO3 and evaluate their electronic, optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties. Rare-earth substitution is thermodynamically favorable (formation energies 1.2-1.6 eV) and induces strong f-p hybridization, reducing the pristine band gap (about 6.2 eV) to about 3.1 eV for Tb. Spin-resolved band structures reveal Gd-driven half-metallicity, Eu-induced spin-selective metallicity, and Tb-stabilized p-type semiconducting behavior. The optical spectra show a red-shifted absorption edge (about 2.0-2.2 eV), a large static dielectric response (epsilon1(0) about 95 for Eu), and plasmonic resonances near 4 eV, enabling visible-light harvesting. Elastic analysis indicates mild lattice softening with preserved ductility (Pugh ratio B/G about 1.56-1.57). Thermoelectric performance is enhanced, with Seebeck coefficients greater than 210 uV/K for Eu and Tb and ZT about 0.45 at 500 K. These results identify rare-earth-doped NaAlO3 as a multifunctional perovskite platform for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Odd-frequency Pairing in Josephson Junctions Coupled by Magnetic Textures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Sardinero, Jorge Cayao, Rubén Seoane Souto, Pablo Burset</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions coupled through magnetic textures provide a controllable platform for odd-frequency superconductivity and Majorana physics. Within a tight-binding Green function framework, induced pair correlations and spectral properties are analyzed under various magnetic and geometric conditions. When the junction is in the topologically trivial regime, even-frequency singlet pairing is dominant, whereas the topological phase is characterized by the coexistence of Majorana bound states and robust odd-frequency equal-spin triplet pairing at the interface edges. The odd-frequency polarized triplets reveal a divergent $1/\omega$ behavior when the Majorana states are decoupled, which is intrinsically connected to their self-conjugation property. The zero-frequency divergence evolves into shifted resonances and linear low-frequency behavior once hybridization occurs. A nonmagnetic interruption in the texture separates the topological superconductor into two topological segments and generates additional inner Majorana modes. When the nonmagnetic barrier is comparable to the inner Majorana states localization length, they hybridize and modify their associated odd-frequency triplet pairing, while the outer edge modes preserve their self-conjugated nature. Tuning the superconducting phase difference further controls the onset of the topological regime and the stability of localized Majorana states. The results highlight the central role of odd-frequency triplet correlations as a probe of topological superconductivity in magnetically engineered Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Philippe Ghosez</p>
            <p>Magnetic spin topological textures recently found their electrical counterparts in polar topologies emerging from the condensation of inhomogeneous polar atomic distortions. Here, we further extend the concept to other non-polar atomic degrees of freedom. Taking SrTiO$_3$ as a prototypical example, we investigate from second-principles atomistic simulations, the equilibrium domain structures and topological textures associated with the natural antiferrodistortive rotations of its oxygen octahedra. % Besides the common 90$^\circ$ antiferrodistortive domain walls (twin boundaries), we identify new metastable 180$^\circ$ domain walls oriented along the $\lbrace100\rbrace_\mathrm{pc}$ direction, when compressive epitaxial strain is applied. These domains exhibit complex antiferrodistortive Bloch- and Néel-like configurations with the later being the most favorable. We also stabilize antiferrodistortive vortex and antivortex structures which are accompanied by co-localized polarization vortices and a complex pattern of the local strain field, giving rise to a trimodal topological structures. Our results extends the concept of topological ordering to non-polar structural degrees of freedom and highlights the role of lattice-mediated couplings in stabilizing complex textures in perovskite oxides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cui-Qun Chen, Wenyuan Qiu, Zhihui Luo, Meng Wang, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.</p>

            <p>PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ artificial superlattices recently emerged as a prototypical platform for the emergence and study of polar topologies. While previous studies mainly focused on the polar textures inherent to the ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ layers, the oxygen octahedra rotations inherent to the paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ layers have attracted much little attention. Here, we highlight a biunivocal relationship between distinct polar topologies -- including $a_1/a_2$ domains, polar vortices, and skyrmions -- within the PbTiO$_3$ layers and specific patterns of oxygen octahedra rotations in the SrTiO$_3$ layers. This relationship arises from a strain-mediated coupling between the two materials and is shown to be reciprocal. Through second-principles atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that each polar texture imposes a corresponding rotation pattern, while conversely, a frozen oxygen octahedra rotation dictates the emergence of the associated polar state. This confirms the strong coupling between oxygen octahedra rotations in SrTiO$_3$ and polarization in PbTiO$_3$, highlighting their cooperative role in stabilizing complex polar textures in related superlattices.</p>

            <p>The performance of silicon nano-devices at cryogenic temperatures is critical for quantum computing technologies. Through multi-valley Monte Carlo simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible, and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering (SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for high-$\kappa$ dielectrics like $\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control, they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility. These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and design of next-generation cryogenic nano-devices.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals multiferroics have emerged as a promising platform to explore novel magnetoelectric phenomena. Recently, it has been shown that monolayer NiI$_2$ hosts robust type-II multiferroicity down to the two-dimensional limit, a giant dynamical magnetoelectric coupling at terahertz frequencies, and an electrically switchable spin polarization. These developments present the possibility of engineering ultrafast, low-energy-consumption, and electrically-tunable spintronic devices based on the collective excitations of the multiferroic order, electromagnons. However, the direct visualization of these bosonic modes in real space and within the monolayer limit remains elusive. Here, we report the atomic-scale observation of electromagnons in monolayer NiI$_2$ using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By tracking the thermal evolution of the multiferroic phase, we establish the energy scale and resolve coherent in-gap excitations of the symmetry-broken multiferroic state. Comparison with first-principles and spin-model calculations reveals that the low-energy modes originate from electromagnon excitations. Spatially resolved inelastic tunneling spectroscopy maps show a stripe-like modulation of the local spectral function at electromagnon energies, matching theoretical predictions. These results provide direct evidence of the internal structure of electromagnons and establish a methodology to probe these modes at the atomic scale, opening avenues for electrically tunable spintronics.</p>

            <p>Understanding the relationship between many-body localization and spectra in non-Hermitian many-body systems is crucial. In a one-dimensional clean, long-range interaction-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization system, we have discovered the coexistence of static and dynamic spectral real-complex phase transitions, along with many-body ergodic-localized phase transitions. The phase diagrams of these two types of transitions show similar non-monotonic boundary trends but do not overlap, highlighting properties distinct from conventional disorder-induced non-Hermitian many-body localization. We also propose a potential experimental realization of this model in cold-atom systems. Our findings provide valuable insights for further understanding the relationship between non-Hermitian many-body localization and non-Hermitian spectra in long-range interacting systems.</p>

It is shown that, in qualitative agreement with the results of the mean field, the heat bath algorithm leads to a significant decrease in the estimate of critical temperatures due to more complete accounting of fluctuations, and also makes it possible to detect phase inhomogeneous states.

            <h2>The Phase Diagram for Percolating Free Surfaces in Disordered Assemblies of Faceted Grains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. J. Priour Jr</p>
            <p>Percolation in systems made up of randomly placed impermeable grains is often examined in the context of system spanning clusters of connected solids forming above a relatively low critical grain density $\rho_{c1}$ or networks of interstitial void volumes ceasing to exist above a signficantly higher threshold $\rho_{c2}$. In this work, we interpret these percolation transitions as, respectively, the low and high density boundaries of percolating exposed surfaces which either ensheath clusters of impermeable particles or line tunnel-like voids. Moreover, we find in the thermodynamic limit exposed surfaces are either sheaths or tunnels with a second order phase transition from the former to the latter at a density threshold $\rho_{c*}$ intermediate between $\rho_{c1}$ and $\rho_{c2}$. We calculate critical inclusion densities with a new method which identifies exposed free surfaces in a geometrically exact manner with a computational cost scaling only linearly in the system volume. We obtain $\rho_{c1}$, $\rho_{c2}$, and $\rho_{c*}$ for a variety of grain geometries, including each of the Platonic solids, truncated icosahedra, and structurally disordered inclusions formed from cubes subject to a random sequence of slicing planes. In the case of the latter, we find a limiting value of $5\%$ for the critical porosity at the void percolation threshold as the number of sustained slices per cube becomes large.</p>

The distribution of probabilities of a discrete energy levels system is used to provide a microscopic definition of work, along with a microscopic definition of the uncompensated heat of Clausius involved in nonequilibrium processes. The later is related to the presence of non-conservatives forces with regards to the variation of the external parameters. This new framework is used to investigate the nonequilibrium relations in stochastic thermodynamics. A new relation is derived for the random quantity of heat associated to the nonequilibrium work protocol. We finally show that the distributions of probabilities of work, heat and uncompensated heat are non-independent each other during a nonequilibrium process.</p>

Such a model is a reasonable starting point for describing the behavior of polymers such as microtubules in gliding assay experiments. We derive sixth-order nonlinear coupled partial differential equations for the intrinsic properties of the filament, namely, its curvature and metric, and show that these equations are capable of supporting multiple different stationary solutions in a co-moving frame, i.e. that chiral active elastic filaments exhibit dynamic multi-stability in their shapes. A linear stability analysis of these solutions is carried out to determine which solutions are stable and a brief analysis of the time-dependent approach to stationary shape is considered. Finally, simulations are presented which confirm many of our predictions while also revealing additional complexity.</p>

            <p>Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its feasibility in the particular case of hematite.</p>

            <p>Excitons govern the light-matter interaction in 2D gapped materials with intrinsically large binding energies. In spite of plentiful optical measurements in the visible for semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, we still lack optical-absorption studies of the exciton structure of insulating 2D materials that requires UV light. Moreover, measurements of the momentum dispersion of excitons in the vicinity of optical limit are rare owing to low resolutions but hold the key to reveal quasiparticle interactions. To close this gap, we employ high momentum resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ($q$-EELS) to explore exciton dispersions of mono- and few-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Surprisingly, we reveal a fine structure of the first bright exciton dispersion band composed by two features (A and A$'$), visible only at small momentum, not predicted by Bethe-Salpeter calculations. Introducing an optical conductivity approximation (OCA), we extract from the experimental $q$-EELS spectra the ultraviolet (UV) optical conductivity at zero momentum, $\sigma(\omega)$, and discuss the exciton fine structure in $\sigma(\omega)$, consistent with previous photoluminescence observations. Our findings establish a general methodology to probe the fine structure of exciton dispersions, providing new insights into exciton-phonon sidebands and eventually polarons in low-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Despite competitive efficiency compared to Si solar cells and relevant stability at near room temperatures the rapid degradation at elevated temperatures remains the critical obstacle for exploitation of perovskite photovoltaics. In this work, a 4-(pyridin-4-yl)triphenylamine (TPA-Py) with pyridine anchor group was employed for inter-grain bulk modification of double-cation CsCH(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite absorbers to enhance thermal stability. Through coordination and dipole-dipole interactions, nitrogen-containing fragments (diphenylamine and pyridine) of TPA-Py passivate uncoordinated cations and improve the phase resilience of perovskite films against segregation. This resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Notable impact of self-assembled monolayer incorporated into the bulk of perovskite film manifested in huge improvement of thermal stability at 85°C (ISOS-D-2). TPA-Py modification improved extended the T80 lifetime to ~600 h compared to only 200 h for the reference under harsh heating stress in ambient conditions. In-depth analysis using photoinduced voltage transients and admittance spectroscopy after different stress periods revealed the screening of ion migration (0.45 eV) for devices with TPA-Py. This work offers an important understanding of the bulk modification of microcrystalline perovskite absorbers and guide for robust design of bulk and buried interfaces in highly efficient perovskite solar cells.</p>

            <p>The energy losses of energetic ions in materials depend on both nuclear and electronic interactions. In channeling geometries, the stopping effect of these interactions can be highly reduced, resulting in deeper ion penetration. Comprehensive, trajectory-dependent models for ion-material interactions are therefore crucial for the accurate prediction of ion range profiles. We present the implementation of a recent electron density-dependent energy-loss model in the efficient molecular dynamics-based MDRANGE code. The model captures \textit{ab initio} electron dynamics using a parametrized ion energy loss function, based on calculations for explicit trajectories using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate the efficient simulation of trajectory-dependent ion range profiles with this comprehensive model for electronic energy losses. Our results indicate that accurate trajectory-dependent ion range profiles can be simulated using well-fitted parametrizations of this model. This method offers a unique tool for validation of the fitted energy-loss functions using energetic ion ranges, which can be measured experimentally but are beyond the capability of full MD simulations due to the computational expense.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour including two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady-states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</p>

            <h2>Fractional quantum Hall states under density decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Wang, Ruihua Fan, Tianle Wang, Samuel J. Garratt, Ehud Altman</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states, the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence -- coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both classes of states undergo a decoherence induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be corrected.</p>

            <p>We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a small finite inertia.</p>

            <h2>Classical to Quantum Diffusive Transport in Atomically Thin Semiconductors Capped with High-k Dielectric</h2>

            <p>The dielectric environment surrounding semiconductors plays a crucial role in determining device performance, a role that becomes especially pronounced in atomically thin semiconductors where charge carriers are confined within a few atomic layers and strongly interact with their surroundings. High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been shown to enhance the performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials by suppressing scattering from charged impurities and phonons, but most studies to date have focused on room-temperature transistor operation. Their influence on quantum transport properties at low temperatures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how capping monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with HfO2 modifies its electronic behavior in the quantum regime. By comparing devices with and without HfO2 capping, we find that uncapped devices exhibit transport dominated by classical diffusive scattering, whereas capped devices show clear Fabry-Perot interference patterns, providing direct evidence of phase-coherent quantum transport enabled by dielectric screening. To gain further insight, we develop a tight-binding interferometer model that captures the effect of dielectric screening on conductive modes and reproduces the experimental trends. Our findings demonstrate that dielectric engineering provides a powerful route to control transport regimes in TMD devices.</p>

            <h2>Techno-economic analysis of self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic systems for grid-scale energy generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihun Lim, Sungwon Lee</p>
            <p>To facilitate the widespread adoption of renewable energy, dispatchable, zero-emission power sources are essential for grid stability. This work performs a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a self-sustainable thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system, an architecture that integrates solar charging to function as a standalone power generation asset. Using theory-based models for air-bridge InGaAs and Si diode cells, our analysis reveals that while the system is not currently competitive from a pure levelized of storage cost (LCOS) perspective due to the high capital expenditure for thermal battery materials, its primary value lies in its competitive levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The results demonstrate that the LCOE of this self-sustaining system can be competitive with conventional dispatchable generators, such as gas turbines. Furthermore, at scales exceeding the gigawatt-hour level, a Si-based system can also achieve an LCOE comparable to that of traditional gas-turbine power plants, despite having a lower conversion efficiency than its InGaAs counterpart. This highlights a practical engineering pathway for leveraging silicon's immense manufacturing scalability, offering a lower-risk route to deployment compared to III-V materials. Ultimately, this work establishes the self-sustainable TPV architecture as a compelling pathway toward providing grid-scale, on-demand, zero-emission power.</p>

            <p>From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based moiré systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Palkanoglou, Alexandros Gezerlis</p>
            <p>The gap equations lie at the core of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, a standard tool in the description of superfluidity. As a set of non-linear integral equations, the gap equations' inherent difficulties oftentimes hinder even the crudest descriptions of superfluid states. Hard-core potentials, high-density superfluids, and coupled-channel pairing are all reasons that have historically required one to provide special treatment to the gap equations to get a solution. In this paper we present a new method for solving the gap equations that holds the promise of being an efficient universal solver that requires the minimum amount of \textit{a priori} knowledge of the targeted solutions. With theoretical evidence of exotic nuclear superfluidity posing new questions to our understanding of this fundamental property of nuclear systems, the presented method can be a valuable tool when exploring new pairing states, finite-temperature properties, or the development of sophisticated descriptions of nuclear superfludity.</p>

            <p>Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) represent one of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation. From a practical implementation perspective, non-Abelian theories present significantly tougher challenges than Abelian LGTs. However, it is unknown whether this is also reflected in increased values of quantum resources relating to the complexity of simulating quantum many-body models. Here, we compare three paradigmatic measures of quantum resources -- stabilizer Rényi entropy, generalized geometric measure of entanglement, and fermionic antiflatness -- for pure-gauge theories on a ladder with Abelian $\mathbb{Z}_N$ as well as non-Abelian $D_3$ and SU(2) gauge symmetries. We find that non-Abelian symmetries are not necessarily inherently harder to simulate than Abelian ones, but rather the required quantum resources depend nontrivially on the interplay between the group structure, superselection sector, and encoding of the gauge constraints. Our findings help indicate where quantum advantage could emerge in simulations of LGTs, both in NISQ and fault-tolerant eras.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grace M. Sommers, J. Alexander Jacoby, Zack Weinstein, David A. Huse, Sarang Gopalakrishnan</p>
            <p>A quantum error-correcting code with a nonzero error threshold undergoes a mixed-state phase transition when the error rate reaches that threshold. We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random \emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher \emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.</p>

            <p>Creation of charged spinless bosons from vacuum in the rigidly rotating frame is studied in presence of the external static electromagnetic fields, being formed either in the resting, or in the general rotating or in the local-flat frames. It is shown that the description remains the same in the resting and the local-flat frames. More specifically, the case of a solenoid (magnetic flux tube) embedded into the rotating empty cylinder (rotation frame) is studied in presence or absence of a static square electric potential well $eA_0$. A supervortex of a spinless-boson field can be created from vacuum when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical value $\Omega_c$. It is shown that $\Omega_c$ is smaller provided the solenoid rests in the resting frame. Then the case is considered when the rotating frame additionally moves with acceleration $\vec{w}(\vec{r})\neq 0$. A specific case $w(r)=G/r$ for $G=const$ is treated explicitly. It is shown that for $G<0$ the charged spinless-boson vortex can be created in rapidly rotating system even in the limit when the magnetic and electric fields tend to zero.</p>

            <p>In plasmonics, nonlocal effects arise when the material response to optical excitations is strongly dependent on the spatial correlations of the excitation. It is well known that a classical free electron gas system supports local Drude volume plasmon waves. Whereas a compressible quantum electron gas system sustains hydrodynamic volume plasmons with nonlocal dispersion isotropic across all high-symmetry directions. Here, distinct from Drude and Hydrodynamic plasmon waves, we present the first observation of crystalline nonlocal volume plasmon waves. We use transmission-based momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy to measure the volume plasmon dispersion of silicon along all the fundamental symmetry axes, up to high momentum values ($q \sim 0.7$ reciprocal lattice units). We show that crystalline nonlocal plasmon waves have a prominent anisotropic dispersion with higher curvature along the light-mass ($\Gamma K$ \& $\Gamma L$) axes, compared to the heavy-mass ($\Gamma X$) axis. We unveil the origin of this phenomenon by experimentally extracting the anisotropic Fermi velocities of silicon. Our work highlights an exquisite nonlocality-induced anisotropy of volume plasmon waves, providing pathways for probing many-body quantum effects at extreme momenta.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anjun Chu, Mikhail Mamaev, Martin Koppenhöfer, Ming Yuan, Aashish A. Clerk</p>
            <p>An attractive approach for stabilizing entangled many-body spin states is to employ engineered dissipation. Most existing proposals either target relatively simple collective spin states, or require numerous independent and complex dissipative processes. Here, we show a surprisingly versatile scheme for many-body reservoir engineering that relies solely on fully collective single-excitation decay, augmented with local Hamiltonian terms. Crucially, all these ingredients are readily available in cavity QED setups. Our method is based on splitting the spin system into groups of sub-ensembles, and provides an easily tunable setup for stabilizing a broad family of pure, highly entangled states with closed-form analytic descriptions. Our results have immediate application to multi-ensemble quantum metrology, enabling Heisenberg-limited sensing of field gradients and curvatures. Notably, the generated states have robustness against common-mode phase noise, and only require simple Ramsey-style measurements. The same setup also allows the stabilization of entangled states in a 1D chain of spin ensembles with symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, and have a direct connection to the outputs of sequential unitary circuits. In particular, we present an efficient method for engineering the celebrated spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zicheng Yan (1), Jialiang Tao (2), Christian Franck (2), David L. Henann (1) ((1) Brown University, (2) University of Wisconsin-Madison)</p>
            <p>This work introduces a calibration framework for material parameter identification in isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models. The framework synergizes the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method to facilitate automated calibration. The formulation of the objective function uses experimental displacement fields measured from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) synchronized with load cell data and can accommodate data from experiments involving homogeneous or inhomogeneous deformation fields. The framework places no restrictions on the target isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model, accommodating models with coupled dependencies on deformation invariants and specialized functional forms with a number of material parameters, and assesses material stability, eliminating sets of material parameters that potentially lead to non-physical behavior for the target hyperelastic constitutive model. To minimize the objective function, a GA is deployed as the optimization tool due to its ability to navigate the intricate landscape of material parameter space. The VFM-GA framework is evaluated by applying it to a hyperelastic constitutive model for compressible elastomeric foams. The evaluation process entails a number of tests that employ both homogeneous and inhomogeneous displacement fields collected from DIC experiments on open-cell foam specimens. The results outperform manual fitting, demonstrating the framework's robust and efficient capability to handle material parameter identification for complex hyperelastic constitutive models.</p>

            <p>Arrays of hundreds or thousands of low temperature detectors have been deployed for many experiments, both bolometers for long wavelength applications and calorimeters for shorter wavelength applications. One challenge that is common to many of these arrays is the efficient use of focal plane area to achieve a large fill fraction of absorbers coupled to detectors. We are developing an integrated fabrication of soft X-ray transition edge sensors (TES) and microwave SQUID multiplexers ($\mu$MUX) with the goal of maximizing the fill fraction of the focal plane area on a scale of many thousand pixel detectors. We will utilize lithographically defined high density interconnects to circumvent limitations in existing solutions that use wirebonds or flip-chip bonds. Here we report the first demonstration of combining TES and $\mu$MUX processes into a single TES-System-on-a-Chip (TES-SoC) fabrication on a silicon wafer. The $\mu$MUX SQUIDs and TES electrothermal feedback circuits are microfabricated first and protected with passivating SiO$_2$, then the TES devices and TES-to-SQUID interconnects are fabricated, and finally the protective layer is removed before the fabrication of the microwave resonators. We show that the microwave SQUIDs are functional and have reasonable yield, and that we are able to read out the transition temperature of the connected TESs using those SQUIDs.</p>

            <p>We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and quantum simulations.</p>

            <p>Energetic electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons in metallic nanoparticles can be harnessed in nanoscale devices for photocatalysis, photovoltaics or sensing. In this work, we study the generation of such hot carriers in bimetallic Janus nanoparticles composed of Au, Ag and Cu using a recently developed atomistic modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale quantum-mechanical tight-binding models. We first analyze spherical Janus nanoparticles whose unique hot-carrier spectrum can be associated with the spectra of the two hemispheres and the interface coupling and find that under solar illumination the Ag-Au system exhibits the highest hot-carrier generation rate. For dumbbell-shaped Janus nanoparticles, we observe a significant increase in hot-carrier generation with increasing neck size. This is caused by a dramatic enhancement of the electric field in the neck region. We also study the dependence of hot-carrier generation on the light polarization and find that the largest generation rates are obtained when the electric field is perpendicular to the interface between the two metals due to the maximal dipole coupling with the electric field. The insights from our study will guide the experimental design of efficient hot-carrier devices based on bimetallic Janus nanoparticles.</p>

We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. On a system of linear size $L$, our decoder requires access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each qubit, and we prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in $L$. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</p>

            <p>Graphene, and other members of the monolayer Xene family, represent an ideal materials platform for "valleytronics", the control of valley localized charge excitations. The absence of a gap in these semi-metals, however, precludes valley excitation by circularly polarized light pulses, sharply circumscribing the possibility of a lightwave valleytronics in these materials. Here we show that combining a deep ultraviolet linearly polarized light pulse with a THz envelope can induce highly valley polarized states in graphene. This dual frequency lightform operates by (i) the deep ultraviolet pulse activating a selection rule at the M saddle points and (ii) the THz pulse displacing the M point excitation to one of the low-energy K valleys. Employing both tight-binding and state-of-the-art time dependent density functional theory, we show that such a pulse results in a near perfect valley polarized excitation in graphene, thus providing a route via the saddle point to a lightwave valleytronics in the gapless Xene family.</p>

As a result, such systems can host non-Hermitian degeneracies called Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs). In this work, we show that Newton polygons and tropical geometric approach allow identification and characterization of Liouvillian EPs. We use two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.</p>

            <p>Studies of entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems have focused largely on initial product states. Here, we investigate the far richer dynamics from initial entangled states, uncovering universal patterns across diverse systems ranging from many-body localization (MBL) to random quantum circuits. Our central finding is that the growth of entanglement entropy can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the initial entanglement in many non-ergodic systems, peaking for moderately entangled initial states. To understand this phenomenon, we introduce a conceptual framework that decomposes entanglement growth into two mechanisms: ``build'' and ``move''. The ``build'' mechanism creates new entanglement, while the ``move'' mechanism redistributes pre-existing entanglement throughout the system. We model a pure ``move'' dynamics with a random SWAP circuit, showing it uniformly distributes entanglement across all bipartitions. We find that MBL dynamics are ``move-dominated'', which naturally explains the observed non-monotonicity of the entanglement growth. This ``build-move'' framework offers a unified perspective for classifying diverse physical dynamics, deepening our understanding of entanglement propagation and information processing in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Liang Mao, Hsin-Yuan Huang, Fernando Brandao</p>
            <p>The nature of randomness and complexity growth in systems governed by unitary dynamics is a fundamental question in quantum many-body physics. This problem has motivated the study of models such as local random circuits and their convergence to Haar-random unitaries in the long-time limit. However, these models do not correspond to any family of physical time-independent Hamiltonians. In this work, we address this gap by studying the indistinguishability of time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics from truly random unitaries. On one hand, we establish a no-go result showing that for any ensemble of constant-local Hamiltonians and any evolution times, the resulting time-evolution unitary can be efficiently distinguished from Haar-random and fails to form a $2$-design or a pseudorandom unitary (PRU). On the other hand, we prove that this limitation can be overcome by increasing the locality slightly: there exist ensembles of random polylog-local Hamiltonians in one-dimension such that under constant evolution time, the resulting time-evolution unitary is indistinguishable from Haar-random, i.e. it forms both a unitary $k$-design and a PRU. Moreover, these Hamiltonians can be efficiently simulated under standard cryptographic assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Random unitaries that conserve energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Mao, Laura Cui, Thomas Schuster, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Random unitaries sampled from the Haar measure serve as fundamental models for generic quantum many-body dynamics. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, recent works have constructed polynomial-size quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries, establishing the concept of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). While PRUs have found broad implications in many-body physics, they fail to capture the energy conservation that governs physical systems. In this work, we investigate the computational complexity of generating PRUs that conserve energy under a fixed and known Hamiltonian $H$. We provide an efficient construction of energy-conserving PRUs when $H$ is local and commuting with random coefficients. Conversely, we prove that for certain translationally invariant one-dimensional $H$, there exists an efficient quantum algorithm that can distinguish truly random energy-conserving unitaries from any polynomial-size quantum circuit. This establishes that energy-conserving PRUs cannot exist for these Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we prove that determining whether energy-conserving PRUs exist for a given family of one-dimensional local Hamiltonians is an undecidable problem. Our results reveal an unexpected computational barrier that fundamentally separates the generation of generic random unitaries from those obeying the basic physical constraint of energy conservation.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Distillation of Qubit Clocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sujay Kazi, Iman Marvian</p>
            <p>We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coupling the system to a reservoir initially in an energy eigenstate, thereby modeling thermal operations supplemented by a work reservoir or battery. For qubit systems, we determine the optimal asymptotic fidelity and show that it is governed by the purity of coherence, a measure of asymmetry derived from the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) Fisher information. In particular, we find that the lowest achievable infidelity (one minus fidelity) scales as $1/N$ times the reciprocal of the purity of coherence of each input qubit, where $N$ is the number of copies, giving this quantity a clear operational meaning. We additionally study many other interesting aspects of the coherence distillation problem for qubits, including computing higher-order corrections to the lowest achievable infidelity up to $O(1/N^3)$, and expressing the optimal channel as a boundary value problem that can be solved numerically.</p>

            <h2>Average-case quantum complexity from glassiness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Zlokapa, Bobak T. Kiani, Eric R. Anschuetz</p>
            <p>Glassiness -- a phenomenon in physics characterized by a rough free-energy landscape -- implies hardness for stable classical algorithms. For example, it can obstruct constant-time Langevin dynamics and message-passing in random $k$-SAT and max-cut instances. We provide an analogous framework for average-case quantum complexity showing that a natural family of quantum algorithms (e.g., Lindbladian evolution) fails for natural Hamiltonian ensembles (e.g., random 3-local Hamiltonians). Specifically, we prove that the standard notion of quantum glassiness based on replica symmetry breaking obstructs stable quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling, which we define by a Lipschitz temperature dependence in quantum Wasserstein complexity. Our proof relies on showing that such algorithms fail to capture a structural phase transition in the Gibbs state, where glassiness causes the Gibbs state to decompose into clusters extensively separated in quantum Wasserstein distance. This yields average-case lower bounds for constant-time local Lindbladian evolution and shallow variational circuits. Unlike mixing time lower bounds, our results hold even when dynamics are initialized from the maximally mixed state. We apply these lower bounds to non-commuting, non-stoquastic Hamiltonians by showing a glass transition via the replica trick. We find that the ensemble of all 3-local Pauli strings with independent Gaussian coefficients is average-case hard, while providing analytical evidence that the general $p$-local Pauli ensemble is non-glassy for sufficiently large constant $p$, in contrast to its classical (Ising $p$-spin, always glassy) and fermionic (SYK, never glassy) counterparts.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Probe Tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sitan Chen, Jordan Cotler, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>Characterizing quantum many-body systems is a fundamental problem across physics, chemistry, and materials science. While significant progress has been made, many existing Hamiltonian learning protocols demand digital quantum control over the entire system, creating a disconnect from many real-world settings that provide access only through small, local probes. Motivated by this, we introduce and formalize the problem of quantum probe tomography, where one seeks to learn the parameters of a many-body Hamiltonian using a single local probe access to a small subsystem of a many-body thermal state undergoing time evolution. We address the identifiability problem of determining which Hamiltonians can be distinguished from probe data through a new combination of tools from algebraic geometry and smoothed analysis. Using this approach, we prove that generic Hamiltonians in various physically natural families are identifiable up to simple, unavoidable structural symmetries. Building on these insights, we design the first efficient end-to-end algorithm for probe tomography that learns Hamiltonian parameters to accuracy $\varepsilon$, with query complexity scaling polynomially in $1/\varepsilon$ and classical post-processing time scaling polylogarithmically in $1/\varepsilon$. In particular, we demonstrate that translation- and rotation-invariant nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians on square lattices in one, two, and three dimensions can be efficiently reconstructed from single-site probes of the Gibbs state, up to inversion symmetry about the probed site. Our results demonstrate that robust Hamiltonian learning remains achievable even under severely constrained experimental access.</p>

            <h2>Hardness of recognizing phases of matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Schuster, Dominik Kufel, Norman Y. Yao, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</p>

            <h2>Quenching, Fast and Slow: Breaking Kibble-Zurek Universal Scaling by Jumping along Geodesics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thi Ha Kyaw, Guillermo Romero, Gaurav Saxena</p>
            <p>A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One promising approach is to use the family of adiabatic shortcut procedures to fast-forward AQC. One caveat, however, is that it requires an additional Hamiltonian that is very challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate an alternate pathway that avoids any extra Hamiltonian in the evolution to fast-forward the adiabatic dynamics by traversing geodesics of a quantum system. We find that jumping along geodesics offers a striking mechanism to highly suppress the density of excitations in many-body systems. Particularly, for the spin-$1/2$ XY model, we analytically prove and numerically demonstrate a rate-independent defect plateau, which contrasts with well-established results for the Kibble-Zurek and anti-Kibble-Zurek mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>A Structural Theory of Quantum Metastability: Markov Properties and Area Laws</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiago Bergamaschi, Chi-Fang Chen, Umesh Vazirani</p>
            <p>Statistical mechanics assumes that a quantum many-body system at low temperature can be effectively described by its Gibbs state. However, many complex quantum systems exist only as metastable states of dissipative open system dynamics, which appear stable and robust yet deviate substantially from true thermal equilibrium. In this work, we model metastable states as approximate stationary states of a quasi-local, (KMS)-detailed-balanced master equation representing Markovian system-bath interaction, and unveil a universal structural theory: all metastable states satisfy an area law of mutual information and a Markov property. The more metastable the states are, the larger the regions to which these structural results apply. Therefore, the hallmark correlation structure and noise resilience of Gibbs states are not exclusive to true equilibrium but emerge dynamically. Behind our structural results lies a systematic framework encompassing sharp equivalences between local minima of free energy, a non-commutative Fisher information, and approximate detailed balance conditions. Our results build towards a comprehensive theory of thermal metastability and, in turn, formulate a well-defined, feasible, and repeatable target for quantum thermal simulation.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear response functions and disorder: the case of photogalvanic effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Ladovrechis, Tobias Meng</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of disorder in the form of impurity scattering on a generalized version of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is nonzero. Considering a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the self-consistent Born approximation to unravel the dependence of the associated two-point retarded Green's function on the strength of intra- and internode scattering, frequency detuning, and energy difference between the two Weyl nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the second-order current density acquires Drude-like features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the second-order response in the presence of strong internode scattering, provided the latter has a linear interdependence with the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the frequency detuning, we also find the real part of the two-point retarded Green's function to be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE"-like form, although the imaginary part of the latter function is in general finite, and the second-order current density oscillates with time due to the finite frequency detuning. We finally conclude with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.</p>

            <p>Inertial particles (IPs) in vortical fluid flow cluster strongly, forming singular structures termed caustics for their resemblance to focal surfaces in optics. Here we show that such extreme aggregation onto low-dimensional submanifolds can arise without mechanical inertia for self-propelled particles (SPPs), through a formal correspondence between the dynamics of IPs and SPPs in a generic background flow. We establish that a singular perturbation underlies caustics formation by SPPs around a single vortex, and numerical studies of SPPs in two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence reveal intense caustics in straining regions of the flow, peaking at intermediate levels of self-propulsion. Our work offers a route to singularly high local concentrations in a macroscopically dilute suspension of zero-Reynolds-number swimmers. Caustics generate burst-like encounters through large relative velocities between neighboring swimmers, with potentially significant implications for communication and sexual reproduction. An intriguing open direction is whether the active turbulence of a suspension of swimming microbes could serve to generate caustics in its own concentration</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Evelyn Tang</p>
            <p>Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</p>

            <h2>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nikolay Ebel, Tom Kennedy, Slava Rychkov</p>
            <p>Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</p>

            <p>In amorphous solids, the vibrational density of states shows an excess of modes over the Debye model, known as the boson peak, whose origin remains unclear. Studies suggest a link to quasi-localized nonphononic vibrations or 'defects,' but identifying them is challenging due to hybridization with phonons that renders methods based on localization properties, such as the participation ratio, unreliable. We introduce a practical method to separate hybridized phonons from localized vibrations and find that boson peak phonons hybridize with compact, two-dimensional defects exhibiting oscillatory pure shear deformations. These two-dimensional defects are also exposed by the procedure recently employed to identify stringlets (Nature Physics volume 18, pages 669-677 (2022)), suggesting that these may not be one-dimensional objects as speculated. Our work demonstrates the presence of localized defects at the boson peak frequency and provides a comprehensive characterization of their vibrational and geometric properties, resolving the tension between the concepts of quasi-localized quadrupolar defects and stringlets.</p>

            <p>Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</p>

Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the whole phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of spin-gap and strange-metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of over-doped regions of SC dome, presence of parallel superconducting stripes in CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and linear-T behavior of strange-metal phase above the overdoped regions of SC dome. It also explains experimental spin textures of cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement-confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we are able to give a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the whole phase diagram, thus giving the sought-after mechanism responsible for the whole phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates.</p>

The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics. Here, we focus on a noncollinear antiperovskite antiferromagnet Mn3NiN as a model system, successfully grown as a single-crystal epitaxial thin film. Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the Néel transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications.</p>

For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.</p>

            <p>The oxygen content plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and superconducting properties of the recently discovered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ superconductors. In this work, we investigate the impact of oxygen vacancies on the insulating behavior of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ across the doping range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$. At $\delta = 0.5$, we construct a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model to describe the system. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the model captures the characteristics of a bilayer Mott insulator. To explore the effects of disorder within the range $\delta = 0$ to $0.5$, we treat the system as a mixture of metallic and Mott insulating phases. By applying the dynamical cluster approximation and the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation, we identify an Anderson localization transition at a critical doping of $\delta \sim 0.2$ through the geometric average of the local density of states.

            <p>Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.</p>

            <h2>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor-Quantum Hall Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enderalp Yakaboylu, Thomas L. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall (QH) state. We show that the effective interaction gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons localized at the SC-QH interface. These fields interact with each other in the presence of a Chern-Simons term originating from the QH sector. The Chern-Simons term leads to a topological contribution to the photon mass and imparts a \emph{fractional} topological charge of $e/2$ to the interface vortices. The topological mass modifies the vortex lattice at the interface, while the topological charge leads to formation of vortex quadruplets. We predict that these effects lead to a \emph{topological} Abrikosov lattice at the interface.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihiko Hasegawa, Tomohiro Nishiyama</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty of the observable is quantified by its variance. In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes.</p>

            <p>The Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy correction at the edge of the mean-field stability regime is known to give rise to beyond mean-field structures in a wide variety of systems. In this work, we analytically derive the LHY energy for two-, three- and four-component one-dimensional bosonic short-range interacting mixtures across the mean-field stability regime. For varying intercomponent attraction in the two-component setting, quantitative deviations from the original LHY treatment emerge being imprinted in the droplet saturation density and width. On the other hand, for repulsive interactions an unseen early onset of phase-separation occurs for both homonuclear and heteronuclear mixtures. Closed LHY expressions for the fully-symmetric three- and four-component mixtures, as well as for mixtures comprised of two identical components coupled to a third independent component are provided and found to host a plethora of mixed droplet states. Our results are expected to inspire future investigations in multicomponent systems for unveiling exotic self-bound states of matter and unravel their nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zongxin Yu, Shuozhen Zhao, Michael J. Miksis, Petia M. Vlahovska</p>
            <p>The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking into account the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layers redistributes and generates destabilizing Maxwell stress on the membrane, which outweighs the stabilizing contribution from the electrical body force, leading to a net destabilizing effect. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Kang, Oskar Vafek</p>
            <p>Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.</p>

            <p>Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques.

The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dana O. Byrne, Stephanie M. Ribet, Karen C. Bustillo, Colin Ophus, Frances I. Allen</p>
            <p>Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (<20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.</p>

            <p>The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueyi Wang, Kristjan Haule</p>
            <p>We develop a variational perturbation expansion around dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) that systematically incorporates nonlocal correlations beyond the local correlations treated by DMFT. We apply this approach to investigate how the DMFT critical temperature is suppressed from its mean-field value and how the critical behavior near the finite-temperature phase transition evolves from the mean-field to the Heisenberg universality class. By identifying the symmetry breaking of paramagnetic diagrammatic expansions as a signature of the Néel transition, we accurately predict the Néel temperature of the three-dimensional cubic Hubbard model across all interaction strengths with low computational cost. Introducing a variational order parameter, our method can be applied to both paramagnetic and long-range ordered states, such as antiferromagnetic order. We compute magnetization and antiferromagnetic susceptibility, demonstrating minor corrections to DMFT solutions in the weak-coupling regime while revealing significant modifications to these properties in the intermediate correlation regime. From the analysis of critical exponents, we establish the emergence of Heisenberg critical behavior beyond the mean-field nature of DMFT.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <p>Discovery of new states of matter is a key objective in modern condensed matter physics, which often leads to revolutionary technological advancements such as superconductivity. Quantum spin nematic, a ``hidden order'' that evades conventional magnetic probes, is one such state. Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$ is a potential spin nematic material, suggested by the observation of a two-magnon Bose-Einstein condensation from above the saturation field. However, direct confirmation of the spin nematicity remains elusive. This Letter presents inelastic neutron scattering spectra from the putative spin nematic phases of Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$, revealing low-energy quadrupole waves that are absent in the neighboring conventional magnetic phases. A spin-one model quantitatively captures the full details of the spin excitation spectra across all low-temperature phases, providing direct evidence of the spin nematic orders. Additionally, we show evidence of the three-magnon continuum and two-magnon bound states in the $1/3$-magnetization plateau, revealing condensation of the two-magnon bound state as the origin of the low-field spin nematic supersolid phase.</p>

            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ FQH state predict various quasi-particle states hosted by the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau, which include $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions of the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau using zero-frequency shot noise experiments on a filter-geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information, like thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the quantum effects in transverse-field Ising spin glass models with rotationally invariant random interactions. The primary aim is to evaluate the validity of a quasi-static approximation that captures the imaginary-time dependence of the order parameters beyond the conventional static approximation. Using the replica method combined with the Suzuki--Trotter decomposition, we established a stability condition for the replica symmetric solution, which is analogous to the de Almeida--Thouless criterion. Numerical analysis of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model estimates a value of the critical transverse field, $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which agrees with previous Monte Carlo-based estimations. For the Hopfield model, it provides an estimate of $\Gamma_\mathrm{c}$, which has not been previously evaluated. For the random orthogonal model, our analysis suggests that quantum effects alter the random first-order transition scenario in the low-temperature limit. This study supports a quasi-static treatment for analyzing quantum spin glasses and may offer useful insights into the analysis of quantum optimization algorithms.</p>

            <p>We report universal bound states of microwave-shielded ultracold molecules that solely depend on the strengths of long-range dipolar interaction and microwave coupling. Under a highly elliptic microwave field, few-molecule scatterings in three dimension are shown to be governed by effective one-dimensional (1D) models, which well reproduce the tetratomic bound state and the Born-Oppenheimer potential in three-molecule sector. For hexatomic systems comprising three identical molecules, we find much deeper bound state than the tetratomic one, with binding energy exceeding twice of the latter. Strikingly, these bound states display Bose-Fermi duality as facilitated by the effective 1D scattering with a large repulsive core from angular fluctuations. For large molecule ensembles, our results suggest the formation of elongated self-bound droplets with crystalline patterns in both bosonic and fermionic molecules.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.</p>

Through experiments and analyses that isolate the effects of light absorption and heating in aluminum nitride, we provide experimental evidence of a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation. Leverage of these light-matter interactions in white ceramic wicks may achieve low-cost, low-energy desalination, reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies, and contribute to future cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</p>

            <h2>Topological Mixed States: Phases of Matter from Axiomatic Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tai-Hsuan Yang, Bowen Shi, Jong Yeon Lee</p>
            <p>For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e., a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: mixed-state bootstrap program. From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges; importantly, these data are robust under relaxation of axioms. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical-demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability: weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Reactive metals generally undergo hydrogen evolution rather than forming direct hydrides when reacting with acids. However, an alternative pathway that involves the direct insertion of atomic hydrogen into the metal lattice, analogous to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), can induce extreme localized stresses on the order of gigapascals (GPa). This mechanochemical process significantly promotes the formation of metal hydrides under high-stress conditions. Inspired by this mechanism, we synthesized at least 19 high-purity metal hydrides, including MgH2, ScH2, YH2, LaH2, LaH2.3, CeH2, SmH2, LuH2, TiH2, ZrH1.6, ZrH2, HfH1.7, HfH2, VH0.8, VH2, NbH, NbH2, Ta2H, and TaH, using bulk metal foils and sulfuric or oleic acid as hydrogen sources. Through high-pressure technique conducted at the GPa level using a diamond anvil cell (DAC), we introduce the pressure concepts Delta-Ph and Delta-Peq to elucidate the synthesis and stabilization mechanisms. Quantitative analysis across all 19 hydrides reveals that the criterion abs(Delta-Peq) greater than Delta-Pph is essential for successful acid-mediated hydride formation; conversely, when abs(Delta-Peq) less than Delta-Pph, hydrogen-induced brittle fracture occurs. This principle not only enables the synthesis of challenging hydrides such as LiH, but also explains failure mechanisms in metals like Fe. Ultimately, this work repurposes HE from a failure mechanism into a controlled tool for hydride synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Börge Göbel, Samir Lounis</p>
            <p>Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</p>

In this paper, we present a purely physical mechanism that solves this challenge, facilitating energy transfer akin to ATP hydrolysis, yet occurring between synthetic nanostructures without any biochemical interactions. This targeted energy delivery is achieved by exploiting a differentiable state-based model to balance the energy profiles that govern the structural transitions in the two nanostructures, creating a combined relaxation pathway with minimal barriers that facilitates energy delivery. We verify the effectiveness and robustness of this mechanism through Molecular Dynamics simulations, demonstrating that a bath of the high-energy structures can systematically and repeatedly drive the target structure out of equilibrium, enabling it to perform tasks. As the mechanism operates only through explicit physical forces without any biochemistry or internal state variables, our results present generic and far-reaching design principles, setting the stage for the next generation of synthetic nanomachines.</p>

            <h2>Rabi-induced localization and resonant delocalization of a binary condensate in a spin-asymmetric quasiperiodic potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swarup K. Sarkar, Sh. Mardonov, E. Ya. Sherman, Pankaj K. Mishra</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double (triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. V. Putilov, D. V. Zakharov, A. Kudlis, A. S. Mel'nikov, A. I. Buzdin</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect can affect the structure, interactions and dynamics of Abrikosov vortices in non-centrosymmetric superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid structures. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory accounting for the spin-orbit and exchange-field effects predicts a chiral distortion of the superfluid velocity, non-central interaction forces and resulting torque in a vortex-antivortex pair, and anisotropy of the Bean-Livingston barrier. These closed-form results are fully confirmed by time-dependent GL numerical simulations carried out with a fourth-order least-squares finite-difference solver, which captures equilibrium single vortex configuration in realistic mesoscopic geometries. The analysis shows that the cubic gradient term shifts vortex cores by an amount proportional to the in-plane exchange field and simultaneously generates a lateral torque that can rotate entire vortex ensembles, showing how spin-orbit coupling and the exchange field enable breakdown of the vortex-antivortex symmetry in a finite-size sample. By combining transparent analytics with quantitative numerics, the work provides the hallmarks of vortex physics in superconducting structures with an intrinsic diode effect and supplies concrete guidelines for designing non-reciprocal superconducting circuits, fluxonic logic elements, and kinetic-inductance devices.</p>

            <p>In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their unique electronic properties. We report upon the growth and electrical transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films is found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state with high mobility electrons. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. For the thinnest 5 nm film, a hole-like state emerges, presumably as the electron-like state is gapped out. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties, and our ability to tune them.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic bounds and symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adarsh Raghu, Izaak Neri</p>
            <p>We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage problems of currents with two boundaries in Markov chains. Using this method, we derive a thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation in terms of the splitting probability and the first-passage time statistics of a fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality. We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents -- those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation -- satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy production at random times and uses martingale methods to perform time-reversal of first-passage quantities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahiro Futami</p>
            <p>By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prakash Timsina, Andres Chappa, Deema Alyones, Boris Kiefer, Ludi Miao</p>
            <p>We propose a spin-ice-based heterostructure capable of encoding magnetic monopole quasiparticle positions for non-volatile information storage applications. Building upon two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases formed at the interface between 2-in-2-out spin ice and all-in-all-out antiferromagnetic pyrochlore iridate, the design introduces a 3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out fragmented barrier layer into the spin-ice matrix, defining two energetically stable monopole traps. The occupancy of these traps can be deterministically controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations reveal robust bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully reversible field-driven transitions, demonstrating the system's potential for reliable, repeatable memory operation. Crucially, the heterostructure exhibits emergent ferromagnetism linked to monopole position, enabling non-destructive readout of the memory state via spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Unlike topological carriers such as skyrmions, monopoles confined at the sub-nanometer scale offer three orders of magnitude higher information density. These results establish these monopole-trap heterostructures as a scalable platform for next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucien Jezequel, Jens H. Bardarson, Adolfo G. Grushin</p>
            <p>Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral localizer invariant. However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here, we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible to a broader physics audience.</p>

When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.</p>

            <p>Layered Cr-chalcogenides compounds offer a rich range of crystal phases with different magnetic properties some of which have been predicted only but not experimentally verified. Here we demonstrate a previously unreported crystal phase of CrS2, namely the distorted octahedral (1T$'$) structure, synthesized via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). We achieved the tuneable synthesis of either 1T$'$ or 1T phase CrS2. The structure were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), as well as scanning electron diffraction (4D-STEM). 4D-STEM reveals that 1T$'$ crystals grow from an originally nucleated kinetically favoured 1T phase which then transform into the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase. Magneto-optic Kerr imaging reveals that the 1T$'$ CrS2 crystals have soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature. Our MOCVD growth of complex phases of 2D CrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and spintronics.</p>

            <p>We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</p>

            <p>Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</p>

            <p>Accurate determination of low-density electronic states in the bandgap (in-gap states) is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic optoelectronic devices. Derivative photoelectron yield spectroscopy (PYS) is employed to estimate the density of states (DOS) of in-gap states. However, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic semiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly represent the DOS. We revealed that PYS signals originate from the single-quantum external photoelectron effect (SQEPE) of in-gap states, SQEPE of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of anions, and the biphotonic electron emission (BEE) effect via exciton fusion. Because BEE signals mask the DOS contribution, derivative PYS misestimates the DOS of in-gap states. In contrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) reliably determines the DOS by separating these components. For a tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) film, CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap and SOMO states over six orders of magnitude, clarifying why the Alq3 layer works effectively in organic light-emitting diodes. In the devices, BEE can act as carrier-generation and degradation processes, and CFS-YS can also probe it. We provide the practical guidelines of low-energy photon measurements for DOS determination, such as measurements of photon-flux dependency.</p>

            <h2>Fate of entanglement in open quantum spin liquid: Time evolution of its genuine multipartite negativity upon sudden coupling to a dissipative bosonic environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p>

            <p>Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.</p>

            <p>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.</p>

Here, we introduce a differentiable optimisation framework that treats scattering calculations, energetics, and chemical constraints as a unified refinement problem. Capability demonstrations across molecules, crystal structures, nanoparticles, and amorphous matter show that this data-driven approach resolves structural degeneracies with multi-modal inputs - suggesting its usefulness for informing, and ultimately guiding, the operation of autonomous laboratories.</p>

            <p>A class of generative models that unifies flow-based and diffusion-based methods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo and Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time stochastic processes called stochastic interpolants to bridge any two probability density functions exactly in finite time. These interpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with an additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The time-dependent density function of the interpolant is shown to satisfy a transport equation as well as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion coefficient. Upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based on probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations with an adjustable level of noise. The drift coefficients entering these models are time-dependent velocity fields characterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score. We show that minimization of these quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for generative models built upon stochastic dynamics, while likelihood control for deterministic dynamics is more stringent. We also construct estimators for the likelihood and the cross entropy of interpolant-based generative models, and we discuss connections with other methods such as score-based diffusion models, stochastic localization, probabilistic denoising, and rectifying flows. In addition, we demonstrate that stochastic interpolants recover the Schrödinger bridge between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the interpolant. Finally, algorithmic aspects are discussed and the approach is illustrated on numerical examples.</p>

            <p>Research on 2D materials has achieved significant milestones and fuelled a rapidly growing industrial sector. This progress, however, is accompanied by challenges in reproducibility, arising from the atomic thinness, fragility, and environmental sensitivity of these materials. Subtle variations in methods or materials can lead to drastically different outcomes, undermining reliability and slowing down both scientific and technological advances. At the same time, academic publishing and funding systems continue to place greater value on novelty than on efforts to improve reproducibility. This Expert Recommendation outlines concrete, actions researchers can take to improve reproducibility in 2D materials science. We introduce two tools - STEP (Standardised Template for Experimental Procedures) and ReChart (Reproducibility Charter) - designed to support rigorous documentation and transparent sharing of protocols, failure modes, and raw data. To illustrate the application of STEP, we provide three detailed examples covering key processes in 2D materials research: graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper foil, wet transfer of CVD graphene, and dry assembly of van der Waals heterostructures. We offer practical recommendations that spans the full research process and show how researchers can engage constructively with stakeholders across academia, funding, publishing, and industry to create a stronger basis for reproducibility, transparency and trust in the field.</p>

            <p>We introduce an efficient method to quantify nonstabilizerness in fermionic Gaussian states, overcoming the long-standing challenge posed by their extensive entanglement. Using a perfect sampling scheme based on an underlying determinantal point process, we compute the Stabilizer Rényi Entropies (SREs) for systems with hundreds of qubits. Benchmarking on random Gaussian states with and without particle conservation, we reveal an extensive leading behavior equal to that of Haar random states, with logarithmic subleading corrections. We support these findings with analytical calculations for a set of related quantities, the participation entropies in the computational (or Fock) basis, for which we derive an exact formula. We also investigate the time evolution of non-stabilizerness in a random unitary circuit with Gaussian gates, observing that it converges in a time that scales logarithmically with the system size. Applying the sampling algorithm to a two-dimensional free-fermionic topological model, we uncover a sharp transition in non-stabilizerness at the phase boundaries, highlighting the power of our approach in exploring different phases of quantum many-body systems, even in higher dimensions.</p>

To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</p>

            <h2>Low-temperature Gibbs states with tensor networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denise Cocchiarella, Mari Carmen Bañuls</p>
            <p>We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oscar W. Kennedy, Kevin G. Crawford, Kowsar Shahbazi, Connor D. Shelly</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</p>

            <h2>Gauging the complex SYK model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziruo Zhang, Cheng Peng</p>
            <p>Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.</p>

            <p>3D structure modeling is essential across scales, enabling applications from fluid simulation and 3D reconstruction to protein folding and molecular docking. Yet, despite shared 3D spatial patterns, current approaches remain fragmented, with models narrowly specialized for specific domains and unable to generalize across tasks or scales. We propose Uni-3DAR, a unified autoregressive framework for cross-scale 3D generation and understanding. At its core is a coarse-to-fine tokenizer based on octree data structures, which compresses diverse 3D structures into compact 1D token sequences. We further propose a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. To address the challenge of dynamically varying token positions introduced by compression, we introduce a masked next-token prediction strategy that ensures accurate positional modeling, significantly boosting model performance. Extensive experiments across multiple 3D generation and understanding tasks, including small molecules, proteins, polymers, crystals, and macroscopic 3D objects, validate its effectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to 256\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x faster.</p>

            <h2>Liouvillian Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin-Lou Ma, Zexian Guo, Yu Gao, Zlatko Papić, Lei Ying</p>
            <p>Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on the system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy environments.</p>

            <h2>Indirect Influence on Network Diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lluís Torres-Hugas, Jordi Duch, Sergio Gómez</p>
            <p>Models of network diffusion typically rely on the Laplacian matrix, capturing interactions via direct connections. Beyond direct interactions, information in many systems can also flow via indirect pathways, where influence typically diminishes over distance. In this work, we analyze diffusion dynamics incorporating such indirect connections using the $d$-path Laplacian framework. We introduce a parameter, the indirect influence, based on the change in the second smallest eigenvalue of the generalized path Laplacian, to quantify the impact of these pathways on diffusion timescales relative to direct-only models. Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive analytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural properties of random networks. Theoretical predictions align well with numerical simulations, providing a phase diagram for when indirect influence becomes significant. We also identify a structural phase transition governed by the emergence of $d$-paths and derive the critical connection probability above which they dramatically alter diffusion. This study provides a quantitative understanding of how indirect pathways shape network dynamics and reveals their collective structural onset.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Mousa, Amit Jamadagni, Eugene Dumitrescu</p>
            <p>We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</p>

            <h2>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Bera, Igor V. Gornyi, Sumilan Banerjee, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eliška Postavová, Gianluca Passarelli, Procolo Lucignano, Angelo Russomanno</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos highlighted by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The classical and quantum crossover points are different due to the noncommutativity of the infinite-time and infinite-spin-magnitude limits and the role played by entanglement in the quantum case, quantified via the two-subsystem entanglement entropy.</p>

            <p>Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</p>

            <h2>The role of entropy production and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in the asymmetric thermalization of open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Álvaro Tejero</p>
            <p>The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entropy production rate, showing that heating begins with a higher entropy production, which drives faster thermalization than cooling. The quantum TKUR links this asymmetry to heat-current fluctuations, demonstrating that larger entropy production suppresses fluctuations, making heating more stable than cooling. Our results reveal the thermodynamic basis of asymmetric thermalization and highlight uncertainty relations as key to nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <p>Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that superconductivity driven by strong quantum-critical fluctuations can emerge near relativistic Mott transitions in twisted two-dimensional materials, taking on a remarkably rich character. In twisted double-bilayer WSe$_2$, all time-reversal-even, gap-opening collective modes promote pairing, whereas time-reversal-odd modes do not. In a Dirac model of twisted bilayer graphene, the Gross-Neveu transition into inter-valley-coherent insulators gives rise to a spectrum of degenerate and nearly degenerate superconducting states. More generally, we show that the richer the Dirac structure, the more readily pairs can form. A crucial ingredient of the theory is that critical fluctuations render the electronic states strongly incoherent, allowing attractive pairing channels to overcome the bare Dirac semi-metal behavior. Finally, we demonstrate a direct relation between boson-mediated pairing and the formation of charge-carrying skyrmionic excitations in the proximate insulating state.</p>

            <p>We establish a novel mechanism for topological transitions in non-Hermitian systems that are controlled by the system size. Based on a new paradigm known as exceptional-bound (EB) band engineering, its mechanism hinges on the unique critical scaling behavior near an exceptional point, totally unrelated to the well-known non-Hermitian skin effect. Through a series of ansatz models, we analytically derive and numerically demonstrate how topological transitions depend on the system size with increasingly sophisticated topological phase boundaries. Our approach can be generically applied to design scaling-dependent bands in multi-dimensional lattices, gapped or gapless, challenging established critical and entanglement behavior. It can be experimentally demonstrated in any non-Hermitian platform with versatile couplings or multi-orbital unit cells, such as photonic crystals, as well as classical and quantum circuits. The identification of this new EB band mechanism provides new design principles for engineering band structures through scaling-dependent phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>While the superconducting transition temperature of hole-doped Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} decreases past optimal doping, superconductivity does not completely disappear even for the fully doped KFe_{2}As_{2} compound. In fact, superconductivity is robust through a Lifshitz transition where electron bands become hole-like around the zone corner at around x=0.7, thus challenging the conventional understanding of superconductivity in iron-based systems. High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the superconducting gap structure, as well as the normal state electronic structure, around optimal doping and across the Lifshitz transition. Our findings reveal a largely orbital-dependent superconducting gap structure, where the more strongly correlated d_{xy} band has a vanishing superconducting gap at higher doping, aligning with the Hund's metal behavior observed in the normal state. Notably, the superconducting gap on the d_{xy} band disappears before the Lifshitz transition, suggesting that the Fermi surface topology may play a secondary role. We discuss how these results point to orbital-selective superconducting pairing and how strong correlations via Hund's coupling may shape superconducting gap structures in iron-based and other multiorbital superconductors.</p>

We investigate a chemically encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response. The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic, providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of transport rather than its absolute magnitude.</p>

            <p>Strong coupling between two quantized excitations in a cavity has the potential to lead to hybridized states that bestow novel quantum phenomena as required for emerging applications. In particular, tunable hybrid magnon-phonon cavities with precise control knobs are in pressing demand for developing quantum functionalities in solid-state platforms. Here, using a combination of synthesis and characterization tools, we present an epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LSMO/STO) heterostructure that manifests strong couplings between the Kittel magnon and the transverse acoustic phonon. Remarkably, leveraging the magnetoelastic interaction at the epitaxial interface, we demonstrate that when the STO substrate undergoes a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at ~105 K, the Kittel magnon of the LSMO thin film splits into three bands due to anisotropic structural strains along the [100], [010], and [001] crystalline axes, hence, resulting in an array of non-degenerate, hybridized magnon-phonon modes. Moreover, we develop an analytical model that can reproduce the interfacial strain-induced magnon splitting and the strength of magnon-phonon coupling. Our work highlights structural phase transitions as a sensitive trigger for generating multistate magnon-phonon hybridization in high-quality magnetoelastic oxide heterostructures - a new route for implementing strain-mediated hybrid magnonics in phononic systems with potential applications in coherent energy and signal transduction.</p>

By decomposing each Bloch exciton wavefunction into products of single-particle electron and hole maximally localized Wannier functions, this real-space approach provides well-defined orbital- and spatial- resolved measures of both Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons at low computational cost. We apply WFDX to excitons in acene crystals, quantifying how the number of rings, the exciton spin state, and the center-of-mass momntum affect spatial localization. Additionally, we show how this real-space representation reflects structural nonsymmorphic symmetries that are hidden in standard reciprocal-space descriptions. We demonstrate how the WFDX framework can be used to efficiently interpolate exciton expansion coefficients in reciprocal-space and outline how it may facilitate evaluation of observables involving position operators, highlighting its potential as a general tool for both analyzing and computing excitonic properties in solids.</p>

Utilizing the formalism on parity-time symmetric two-level systems reveals nonlinear phenomena that are not present in Hermitian systems, such as extra terms in the conductivity, corrections to the velocity operator, photocurrent, and resonance structures with higher-order poles at one-photon transitions. These features yield qualitatively distinct harmonic generation responses like real second-order conductivities and nonzero DC limits.

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) semi-Dirac materials feature a unique anisotropic band structure characterized by quadratic dispersion along one spatial direction and linear dispersion along the other, effectively hybridizing ordinary and Dirac fermions. The anisotropy of energy dispersion can be further modulated through band tilting along either spatial direction of the wave vector. We propose a new definition of tilt parameter to characterize Lifshitz phases in 2D semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratically dispersing direction. Using linear response theory, we theoretically investigate the interband optical conductivity of 2D tilted semi-Dirac bands. Our analytical zero-temperature results reveal pronounced distinctions from Dirac and semi-Dirac systems tilting along the linearly dispersing direction. Notably, we find that spectral fixed point emerges in the optical conductivity over a specific range of the tilt parameter, a phenomenon explained by the corresponding behavior of the joint density of states. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework for identifying and characterizing 2D tilted semi-Dirac materials and establish clear spectral fingerprints that distinguish different kinds of 2D semi-Dirac bands and Dirac bands. Our predictions can guide future experimental studies of anisotropic band engineering and tilt-dependent phenomena.</p>

We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum transition in 2 dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. C. Diamantini, C. A. Trugenberger, V. M. Vinokur</p>
            <p>The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths transition but have nothing to do with disorder.</p>

            <h2>Quasiparticle Description of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy for SrCuO2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitar Pashov, Casey Eichstaedt, Swagata Acharya, Mark van Schilfgaarde</p>
            <p>SrCuO2 has long been considered a near-archetypal realization of a quasi one dimensional (1D) system of interacting electrons with short-range interactions. Within this framework, experimental observations - interpreted through the lens of the 1D Hubbard model-suggest that electron and hole excitations decay into two types of (unphysical) collective bosonic modes: spinons, which carry the spin degree of freedom, and holons, which carry the charge degree of freedom. This model, known as spin-charge separation, is most directly evidenced by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photo-induced hole decays into a continuum of these excitations. Here we present an alternative perspective grounded in first-principles, self-consistent, and parameter-free many-body perturbation theory. In this revised quasiparticle framework, ARPES can be understood as a one-body effect arising from mild disorder in a long-range antiferromagnetic ground state. the emergence of the so-called spinon branch arises naturally from spin disorder, the anomalous line widths are accurately captured, and we provide a compelling explanation for the spectral weight observed at the non-magnetic zone boundary. This reinterpretation provides a unified explanation for key experimental signatures previously attributed to spin-charge separation, including features observed in optical conductivity. Additionally, we show that SrCuO2 exhibits a nontrivial interchain coupling that significantly influences both its one-particle and two-particle spectral functions. By comparing the spectral features of SrCuO2 with those of La2CuO4, we argue that SrCuO2 shares notable similarities with the two-dimensional cuprates - both being rooted in a common CuO4 plaquette-based molecular orbital framework.</p>

            <h2>Quartic level repulsion in a quantum chaotic three-body system without symplectic symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex D. Kerin, Barbara Dietz, Joachim Brand</p>
            <p>Among the fundamental symmetry classes of quantum chaotic systems in Dyson's threefold way, the symplectic class is rarely observed in nature. Characterized by the strongest possible level repulsion in the energy spectrum, the symplectic symmetry class also implies a double (Kramers) degeneracy of levels. Studying the spectral statistics of three quantum particles (identical bosons or mass-imbalanced fermions) in a harmonic trap, we find numerical evidence for strong level repulsion in the regime of weak contact interactions. While the statistical indicators are consistent with quantum chaos in systems with symplectic symmetry, the absence of Kramers degeneracy rules out this symmetry. In the strongly-interacting unitary limit either Poissonian or stick statistics are observed (depending on commensurability of the mass ratio) indicating regular dynamics.</p>

            <p>Thermal gradient driven skyrmion dynamics offers a promising route toward green spintronics, enabling the utilization of waste heat for information transport and processing. Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate Neel skyrmions in a Co-Pt bilayer nanoracetrack and demonstrate that stochastic torques induced by a thermal gradient drive skyrmion motion toward the hotter region with a nearly vanishing Hall angle. The dynamics depends sensitively on intrinsic material parameters - the skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing damping constant, increases with stronger thermal gradients, and varies systematically with saturation magnetization, interfacial DMI strength, and uniaxial out of plane anisotropy. Importantly, we identify a specific range of material parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while the Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This comprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design framework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic systems.</p>

            <p>It is an ongoing quest to realize topologically ordered quantum states on different platforms including condensed matter systems, quantum simulators and digital quantum processors. Unlike conventional states characterized by their local order, these exotic states are characterized by their non-local entanglement. The consequences of topological order can be as profound as they are surprising, ranging from the emergence of fractionalized anyonic excitations to potentially providing a scalable platform for quantum error correction. This deep connection to quantum computing naturally motivates the realization and study of topologically ordered quantum states on quantum processors. However, due to the non-local nature of these states, their study presents a challenge for near-term quantum devices. This Perspective aims to review the recent progress towards the experimental realization of topologically ordered quantum states, their potential applications, and promising directions of future research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edward McCann</p>
            <p>By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.</p>

            <p>The design of strain-stable, or even strain-enhanced thermal transport materials is critical for stable operation of high-performance electronic devices. However, most nanomaterials suffer from strain-induced degradation, with even minor tensile strains markedly reducing thermal conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that screw-dislocated graphites (SDGs), recently identified as topological semimetals, display an unusual increase in cross-plane thermal conductivity under both tensile and compressive strains, revealed by high-accuracy machine-learning-potential-driven non-equilibrium molecular dynamics. Notably, SDGs exhibit over 100% enhancement under tensile strains up to 80% along the dislocation axis, arising from strain-induced increase in dislocation interface tilt angle that elongates the effective heat transfer paths. Their thermal conductivity surpasses multilayer graphene by an order of magnitude. An analytical model is further derived linking thermal conductivity to dislocation number and strain, offering a predictive framework for designing strain-tunable screwdislocated structures. These findings highlight SDGs as a promising platform for high-performance electronic and wearable devices with tunable thermal properties.</p>

            <p>In complex oxides, charge carriers often couple strongly with lattice vibrations to form polarons-entangled electron-phonon quasiparticles whose transport properties remain difficult to characterize. Experimental access to intrinsic polaronic transport requires ultraclean samples, while theoretical descriptions demand methods beyond low-order perturbation theory. Here, we combine the growth of high-quality oxygen-vacancy-doped anatase TiO2 films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with a first-principles electron-phonon diagrammatic Monte Carlo (FEP-DMC) framework recently developed for accurate polaron predictions. Our films exhibit record-high electron mobility for anatase TiO2, in excellent agreement with FEP-DMC calculations conducted prior to experiment, which predict a room-temperature mobility of 45 +/- 15 cm2V-1s-1 and a mobility-temperature scaling of mobility proportional to T^(-1.9 +/- 0.077). Microscopic analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the role of oxygen vacancies in modulating transport at lower temperatures. FEP-DMC further provides quantitative insight into polaron formation energy, phonon cloud distribution, lattice distortion around the polaron, and the polaronic contribution to mobility. Together, these results establish a predictive theory-experiment workflow to characterize polarons and provide a microscopic understanding of large-polaron transport in anatase TiO2, with broader implications for complex oxides and other polaronic materials.</p>

            <h2>Data as Commodity: a Game-Theoretic Principle for Information Pricing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pasquale Casaburi, Giovanni Piccioli, Pierpaolo Vivo</p>
            <p>Data is the central commodity of the digital economy. Unlike physical goods, it is non-rival, replicable at near-zero cost, and traded under heterogeneous licensing rules. These properties defy standard supply--demand theory and call for new pricing principles. We propose a game-theoretic approach in which the value of a data string emerges from strategic competition among N players betting on an underlying stochastic process, each holding partial information about past outcomes. A better-informed player faces a choice: exploit their informational advantage, or sell part of their dataset to less-informed competitors. By analytically computing the Nash equilibrium of the game, we determine the price range where the trade is beneficial to both buyer and seller. We uncover a rich landscape of market effects that diverge from textbook economics: first, prospective sellers and buyers can compete or jointly exploit the less informed competitors depending on the quality of data they hold. In a symbiotic regime, the seller can even share data for free while still improving her payoffs, showing that losing exclusivity does not necessarily reduce profit. Moreover, rivalry between well-informed players can paradoxically benefit uninformed ones, demonstrating that information abundance does not always translate to higher payoffs. We also show that the number of players influences the competition between informed parties: trades impossible in small markets become feasible in larger ones. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for the pricing of intangible goods in dynamically interacting digital markets, which are in need of robust valuation principles.</p>

            <h2>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Léo Touzo, Pierre Le Doussal</p>
            <p>We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</p>

            <h2>Electrical and thermal magnetotransport and the Wiedemann-Franz law in semimetals with electron-electron scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keigo Takahashi, Hiroyasu Matsuura, Hideaki Maebashi, Masao Ogata</p>
            <p>We study the electrical and thermal transport properties and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law of two-carrier semimetals using exact treatments of the Boltzmann equation with the impurity and electron-electron scatterings in a magnetic field. For comparison, we also study those in the case of Baber scattering: a single-carrier system with an impurity scattering and phenomenological momentum-dissipative electron-electron scattering. In both systems, the longitudinal and transverse WF laws, $L = L_{\text{H}} = L_{0}= \pi^2k_B^2/3e^2$, hold at zero temperature, where the Lorenz ratio $L$ and the Hall Lorenz ratio $L_{\text{H}}$ are ratios of thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\mu\nu}$ to electrical conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ divided by temperature. However, the electron-electron scattering makes Lorenz ratios deviate from $L_{0}$ with increasing temperature. To describe the WF law in a magnetic field, we introduce another set of Lorenz ratios, $\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$, defined as the ratios of the resistivity and the Hall coefficient to their thermal counterparts. The WF laws for them, $\widetilde{L} = \widetilde{L}_{\text{H}} = L_{0}$, and their violation are helpful for the discussion of $L$ and $L_{\text{H}}$. For Baber scattering, our exact result shows $L_{\text{H}}/L_{0} \sim (L/L_{0})^2$ in a weak magnetic field. In semimetals, the violations of the WF laws are significant, reflecting the different temperature dependence between the electrical and thermal resistivities in a magnetic field. This is because the momentum conservation of the electron-electron scattering has a completely different effect on electrical and thermal magnetotransport. We sort out these behaviors using $\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$. We also provide a relaxation time approximation, which is useful for comparing theory and experiment.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of a mean-field Ising model whose coupling depends on the magnetization via a linear feedback function. A key feature of this linear feedback Ising model (FIM) is the possibility of temperature-induced bistability, where a temperature increase can favor bistability between two phases. We show that the linear FIM provides a minimal model for a transcritical bifurcation as the temperature varies. Moreover, there can be two or three critical temperatures when the external magnetic field is non-negative. In the bistable region, we identify a Maxwell temperature where the two phases are equally probable, and we find that increasing the temperature favors the lower phase. We show that the probability distribution becomes non-Gaussian on certain time intervals when the magnetization converges algebraically at either zero temperature or critical temperatures. Near critical points in the parameter space, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation, construct the families of equilibrium distributions, and formulate scaling laws for transition rates between two stable equilibria. The linear FIM provides considerable freedom to control steady-state bifurcations and their associated equilibrium distributions, which can be desirable for modeling feedback systems across disciplines.</p>

            <p>While quantum computing can accomplish tasks that are classically intractable, the presence of noise may destroy this advantage in the absence of fault tolerance. In this work, we present a classical algorithm that runs in $n^{\rm{polylog}(n)}$ time for simulating quantum circuits under local depolarizing noise, thereby ruling out their quantum advantage in these settings. Our algorithm leverages a property called approximate Markovianity to sequentially sample from the measurement outcome distribution of noisy circuits. We establish approximate Markovianity in a broad range of circuits: (1) we prove that it holds for any circuit when the noise rate exceeds a constant threshold, and (2) we provide strong analytical and numerical evidence that it holds for random quantum circuits subject to any constant noise rate. These regimes include previously known classically simulable cases as well as new ones, such as shallow random circuits without anticoncentration, where prior algorithms fail. Taken together, our results significantly extend the boundary of classical simulability and suggest that noise generically enforces approximate Markovianity and classical simulability, thereby highlighting the limitation of noisy quantum circuits in demonstrating quantum advantage.</p>

The non-Abelian algebra of these symmetries and the projectors onto the fragmented subsectors leads to the emergence of exponentially many logical qubits encoded in degenerate pairs of eigenstates, which can be highly entangled. This algebra also provides necessary conditions for experimental signatures of Hilbert-space fragmentation, such as the persistence of density imbalances at late times.</p>

            <p>Far from equilibrium, neural systems self-organize across multiple scales. Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations. Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics, coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and joint probability functions. Towards mesoscales, diffusion-guided renormalization targets learning the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative neural trajectories occupying lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling coarse-to-fine control in systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.</p>

These forms occur in correspondence with the natural numbers, loosely analogous to the energy levels in a Bohr atom. We find the remarkable result that one of these helical forms is an excellent candidate for an {\alpha}-helix through seemingly improbable quantum chemistry coincidences that fit the geometrical requirements.

Due to the strain sensitivity of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxides), adapting it to non-planar stellarator geometries requires new winding, structural, and cooling strategies. We report on the results of a staged prototype program (P1, P2, P3) employing 3D-printed, sectional aluminum coil frames with winding channels, gimballed constant-tension winding mechanics, and solder potting for radial current redistribution and passive quench mitigation. The first prototype, P1 (planar elliptical, double-pancake) tested additive manufacture, sectional joining and baseline winding, achieving predicted fields at 77 K. P2 (non-planar, higher strain) was wound to 42 turns, energized at 30-40 K to produce expected magnetic fields, and studied thermal gradients and resistance at up to 4.5 kAt. Design evolution in P3 introduces concave geometry with dual double-pancakes, 200 turns, and approaches the 70 kAt target at 20 K. In parallel, sub-microhm lap joints have been developed. Together, these results de-risk manufacturing, cooling interfaces, quench management, and diagnostics, paving the way for full-size non-planar HTS stellarator coils for CSX.</p>

            <h2>Dispersion and the transport of exciton-polaritons in an optical conveyor belt</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingran Xu, Chunyu Jia, Xin-Xin Yang</p>
            <p>The growing interest in exciton-polaritons has driven the need to manipulate their motion and engineer their band structures to the forefront of contemporary research. This study explores the band structures that emerge from a spatially modulated potential, ingeniously realized through the use of an optical conveyor belt. By leveraging Bloch theory and conducting a meticulous analysis of the time evolution of polariton intensity in Fourier space, we have derived the energy dispersion relations both analytically and numerically within the context of a static lattice model. For time-dependent potentials, we employ the Lagrange variational method to elucidate the dynamics of polariton motion. Our results reveal that polaritons exhibit linear dispersion and follow linear trajectories with minor oscillations superimposed. This investigation not only deepens our fundamental understanding of exciton-polaritons but also provides a robust tool for advancing photonic devices and exerting precise control over current transport in quantum computing. Our findings pave the way for future innovations in high-speed and high-performance technologies.</p>

            <p>Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yibin Guo, Manuel Schneider, Takis Angelides, Karl Jansen, C.-J. David Lin, Yao Ting Su</p>
            <p>We present a framework for preparing quantum states from matrix product states (MPS) with open and periodic boundary conditions on quantum devices. The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <p>The distribution of entanglement across distant qubits is a central challenge for the operation of scalable quantum computers and large-scale quantum networks. Existing approaches rely on deterministic state transfer schemes or probabilistic protocols that require active control or measurement and postselection. Here we demonstrate an alternative, fully autonomous process, where two remote qubits are entangled through their coupling to a quantum-correlated photonic reservoir. In our experiment, a Josephson parametric converter produces a Gaussian, continuous-variable entangled state of propagating microwave fields that drives two spatially separated supercon- ducting transmon qubits into a stationary, discrete-variable entangled state. Beyond entanglement distribution, we also show that superconducting qubits can be used to directly certify two-mode squeezing, with higher sensitivity and without the need for calibrated noise-subtraction. These results establish networks of qubits interfaced with distributed continuous-variable entangled states as a powerful new platform for both foundational studies and quantum-technology relevant applications.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adithya Sriram, Vedika Khemani, Benedikt Placke</p>
            <p>Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darren Pereira, Leonardo Banchi</p>
            <p>We present a tensor-network-based method for simulating a weakly-measured quantum circuit. In particular, we use a Markov chain to efficiently sample measurements and contract the tensor network, propagating their effect forward along the spatial direction. Applications of our algorithm include validating quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications, where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.</p>

Remarkably, the volume-law phase featuring logarithmic entanglement growth for certain initial states. We attribute this slow entanglement growth to the similarly slow growth of the participation entropy, which bounds the entanglement. Furthermore, the quantum circuit can be mapped to a classical spin model with real positive Boltzmann weights which involves local multi-spin interactions and displays glassy dynamics at finite temperature. We trace the origin of both the slow quantum dynamics and the classical glassiness to the presence of large, non-local symmetry operators. Our work establishes a novel connection between quantum entanglement dynamics and classical glassy behavior, offering a new geometric perspective on entanglement phase transitions.</p>

            <p>The spectral properties, momentum dispersion, and broadening of bulk plasmonic excitations of 25 elemental metals are studied from first principles calculations in the random-phase approximation. Spectral band structures are constructed from the resulting momentum- and frequency-dependent inverse dielectric function. We develop an effective analytical representation of the main collective excitations in the dielectric response, by extending our earlier model based on multipole-Padé approximants (MPA) to incorporate both momentum and frequency dependence. With this tool, we identify plasmonic quasiparticle dispersions exhibiting complex features, including non-parabolic energy and intensity dispersions, discontinuities due to anisotropy, and overlapping effects that lead to band crossings and anti-crossings. We also find good agreement between computed results and available experiments in the optical limit. The results for elemental metals establish a reference point that can guide both fundamental studies and practical applications in plasmonics and spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Castagnède, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg</p>
            <p>Conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations struggle when simulating particles with steeply varying interaction potentials, due to the need to use a very short time step. Here, we demonstrate that an event-driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) approach first introduced by Peters and de With [Phys. Rev. E 85, 026703 (2012)] represents an excellent substitute for MD in the canonical ensemble. In addition to correctly reproducing the static thermodynamic properties of the system, the EDMC method closely mimics the dynamics of systems of particles interacting via the steeply repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) potential. In comparison to time-driven MD simulations, EDMC runs faster by over an order of magnitude at sufficiently low temperatures. Moreover, the lack of a finite time step in EDMC circumvents the need to trade accuracy against simulation speed associated with the choice of time step in MD. We showcase the usefulness of this model to explore the phase behavior of the WCA model at extremely low temperatures, and to demonstrate that spontaneous nucleation and growth of the Laves phases is possible at temperatures significantly lower than previously reported.</p>

            <p>In semiconductor nanostructures, spin blockade (SB) is the most scalable mechanism for electrical spin readout, requiring only two bound spins for its implementation. In conjunction with charge sensing techniques, SB has led to high-fidelity readout of spins in semiconductor-based quantum processors. However, various mechanisms may lift SB, such as strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or low-lying excited states, hence posing challenges to perform spin readout at scale and with high fidelity in such systems. Here, we present a method, based on the dependence of the two-spin system polarizability on energy detuning, to perform spin state readout even when SB lifting mechanisms are dominant. It leverages SB lifting as a resource to detect selectively different spin measurement outcomes. We demonstrate the method using a hybrid system formed by a quantum dot (QD) and a Boron acceptor in a silicon p-type transistor and show spin-selective readout of different spin states under SB lifting conditions due to (i) SOC and (ii) low-lying orbital states in the QD. We further use the method to determine the detuning-dependent spin relaxation time of 0.1 - 8 $\mu$s. Our method should help perform projective spin measurements with high spin-to-charge conversion fidelity in systems subject to strong SOC, will facilitate state leakage detection and enable complete readout of two-spin states.</p>

            <h2>Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tadeusz Kosztołowicz, Aldona Dutkiewicz, Katarzyna D. Lewandowska</p>
            <p>The ordinary subdiffusion equation, with a fractional time derivative of at most first order, describes a process in which the propagation velocity of diffusing molecules is unlimited. To avoid this non-physical property different forms of the Cattaneo subdiffusion equation have been proposed. We define the Cattaneo effect as a delay of the ordinary subdiffusion flux activation by a random time. By incorporating this effect into the flux equation we get a Cattaneo--type subdiffusion equation (CTSE). We study the CTSE that differs from the ordinary subdiffusion equation by an additional integro--differential operator (AO) controlled by a time delay probability distribution. A method for deriving CTSE within the standard continuous time random walk model is also shown. As examples, we consider the CTSE with AO being the Caputo fractional time derivative of the order independent of the subdiffusion exponent and with the AO with a kernel that is a slowly varying function. In the first case the Cattaneo effect disappears over time much faster than in the second one. Based on the Green's functions, the time evolutions of the first passage time distribution and of the mean square displacement of a diffusing molecule, we discuss whether the influence of the Cattaneo effect is significant. In the considered examples, this influence seems to be small. However, a relative probability of finding a molecule at a long distance from the starting point for the CTSE equation with respect to the ordinary subdiffusion equation increases rapidly with distance. Even small changes caused by the Cattaneo effect can lead to different results in modeling processes where a faster appearance of a diffusing object changes the nature of the process. The effect may be important, for example, in modeling the spread of an epidemic when a diffusing object is a source of infection.</p>

            <p>Recently, the superconducting properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals have attracted considerable attention. By numerically solving the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for an $s-$wave superconducting Fibonacci chain, we find that the system exhibits universal end superconductivity, where the pair potential at the chain ends can persist at higher temperatures compared to the bulk critical temperature ($T_{cb}$) of the condensate in the chain center. Furthermore, our study reveals two distinct critical temperatures at the left ($T_{cL}$) and right ($T_{cR}$) ends of the chain. This complex behavior arises from the competition between topological bound states and critical states, a characteristic of quasicrystals. With the chosen parameters, the maximal enhancement of $T_{cR}$ reaches up to $66\%$ relative to $T_{cb}$, while $T_{cL}$ can increase by up to $31\%$. Our study sheds light on the phenomenon of end superconductivity in Fibonacci quasicrystals, pointing to alternative pathways for increasing the superconducting critical temperature.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-breaking phases in many-fermion systems are characterized by anomalous functions that represent transient processes during which some properties of free particles, such as spin or charge, are not conserved. Connecting the low-temperature symmetry-breaking phase with the high-temperature one within the Baym-Kadanoff scheme, beyond the static mean-field approximation, remains an unresolved, long-standing challenge. We identify the reason why approximations with critical dynamical fluctuations in the Schwinger-Dyson equation lead to a mismatch in the transition temperatures calculated from the high- and low-temperature phases. We propose a solution to this generic problem by excluding anomalous contributions to response functions that do not obey conservation of excitations in their interactions. We illustrate this behavior using the example of an antiferromagnetic state. We reveal that the spectral function in the antiferromagnetic phase exhibits a double-gap structure at zero temperature when the anomalous self-energy is frequency-dependent.</p>

            <p>Self-interaction error (SIE), arising from the imperfect cancellation of the spurious classical Coulomb interaction between an electron and itself, is a persistent challenge in modern density functional approximations. This issue is illustrated using the prototypical one-electron system $H_2^+$. While significant efforts have been made to eliminate SIE through the development of computationally expensive nonlocal density functionals, it is equally important to explore whether SIE can be mitigated within the framework of more efficient semilocal density functionals. In this study, we present a non-empirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that incorporates the Laplacian of the electron density. Our results demonstrate that the meta-GGA significantly reduces SIE, yielding a binding energy curve for $H_2^+$ that matches the exact solution at equilibrium and improves across a broad range of bond lengths over those of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) semilocal density functionals. This advancement paves the way for further development within the realm of semilocal approximations.</p>

Rather, it is compatible with a two-parameter, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like flow with a line of fixed points (the many-body localized phase), which terminates into the localization transition critical point. Therefore, we argue that previous studies, which assumed the existence of an isolated Wilson- Fisher fixed point and performed one-parameter finite-size scaling analysis, could not explain the numerical data in a coherent way.</p>

            <p>Crystalline defects critically influence material properties, necessitating accurate simulation methods. Existing approaches, from atomic-scale configurations to continuum elasticity, face inherent limitations in modeling dislocation-induced lattice deformation. The amplitude expansion of the phase field crystal (APFC) model bridges this gap with a mesoscopic description. This paper introduces a computationally efficient Fourier pseudospectral method for solving the APFC equations. The method exploits system periodicity and solution analyticity--the latter's rigorous proof remaining an open question, as discussed herein--to enable precise implementation of periodic boundary conditions. Numerical experiments on 2D triangular and 3D body-centered cubic lattices demonstrate that the method accurately reproduces the strain fields of edge dislocations, matching continuum theory predictions. These results confirm the APFC model's potential for capturing complex defect structures at the mesoscale, paving the way for simulating more intricate defect dynamics.</p>

We study the Fraunhofer pattern of planar Josephson junctions in presence of different kinds of disorder and imperfections and we find that a junction that is {\it mirror} symmetric at zero-field forbids the diode effect and that the diode effect is typically magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in planar junctions, with an extension to the multi-terminal case and to systems of Josephson junctions connected in parallel.</p>

            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations not only allow to predict the vibrational and optical properties of solids but also to understand and disentangle the mechanisms playing a key role in the generation of coherent optical phonons. Recent experiments performed on a Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanofilm have shown that a THz pulse launches at least a coherent $A_{1g}^1$ phonon as the transient transmittance measured using an isotropic detection scheme displays oscillations with a frequency matching the frequency of the $A_{1g}^1$ mode measured in Raman experiments. Such an observation can be explained by invoking either a sum frequency process or cubic/quartic phonon-phonon couplings as considered for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a parent compound of Bi$_2$Te$_3$. By resorting to group theory and calculating energy surfaces from first-principles, the main phonon-phonon couplings can be identified. Furthermore, a minimal model can be built to compute the dynamics of the Raman active modes coupled to the infrared active mode driven by the experimental THz pulse. Our model firmly establishes that cubic phonon-phonon interactions are relevant as the agreement between the computed and experimental transmittance is noteworthy.</p>

            <p>Unlike biological active matter that constantly adapt to their environment, the motors of synthetic active particles are typically agnostic to their surroundings and merely operate at constant force. Here, we design colloidal active rods capable of modulating their inner activity in response to crowding, thereby enforcing a primitive form of quorum sensing interactions. Through experiments, simulations, and theory we elucidate the impact of these interactions on the phase behavior of isotropic active matter. We demonstrate that, when conditioned to density, motility regulation can either lead to an absorbing phase transition, where all particles freeze their dynamics, or to atypical phase separation, where flat interfaces supporting a net pressure drop are in mechanical equilibrium. Fully active and fully arrested particles can then form heterogeneous patterns ruled by the competition between quorum sensing and mechanical interactions. Beyond the specifics of motile colloids, we expect our findings to apply broadly to adaptive active matter assembled from living or synthetic units.</p>

            <p>We study the static and dynamical properties of a harmonically confined Rouse polymer coupled to a fluctuating correlated medium, which affect each other reciprocally during their stochastic evolution. The medium is modeled by a scalar Gaussian field which can feature modes with slow relaxation and long-range spatial correlations. We show that these modes affect the long-time behavior of the average position of the center of mass of the polymer, which, after a displacement, turns out to relax algebraically towards its equilibrium value. This is a manifestation of the non-Markovian nature of the effective evolution of the position of the center of mass, once the degrees of freedom of the medium have been integrated out. In contrast, we show that the coupling to the medium speeds up the relaxation of higher Rouse modes. We further characterize the typical size of the polymer as a function of its polymerization degree and of the correlation length of the medium, particularly when the system is driven out of equilibrium via the application of a constant external driving force. Finally, we study the response of a linear polymer to a tensile force acting on its terminal monomers.</p>

            <p>Double network hydrogels show remarkable mechanical performance, combining high strength and fracture toughness with sufficient stiffness to bear load, despite containing only a low density of cross-linked polymer molecules in water. We introduce a simple mesoscale model of a double network material, detailed enough to resolve the salient microphysics of local plastic bond breakage, yet simple enough to address macroscopic cracking. Load sharing between the networks results in a delocalisation of stress such that the double network inherits both the stiffness of its stiff-and-brittle sacrificial network and the ductility of its soft-and-ductile matrix network. The underlying mechanism is a reduction in the Eshelby stress propagator between sacrificial bonds, inhibiting the tendency for the plastic failure of one sacrificial bond to propagate stress to neighbouring sacrificial bonds and cause a follow-on cascade of breakages. The mechanism of brittle macroscopic cracking is thereby suppressed, giving instead ductile deformation via diffusely distributed microcracking.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerrit Niederhoff, Ryusei Kataoka, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the current-enabled linear optical conductivity of collective modes in superconductors with unconventional pairing symmetries. After deriving general formulas for the optical conductivity of a superconductor featuring multiple pairing channels and bands using the path integral formalism, we apply these formulas to several models. Using a model of competing s- and d-wave pairing interactions, we find that several known collective modes generate peaks in the optical conductivity upon injection of a supercurrent. This includes single- and multiband versions of Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, and Leggett modes. Using a model for interband p-wave superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find that in such a system Bardasis-Schrieffer modes are optically active even without introducing a supercurrent. In a p+ip chiral ground state, these modes turn out to produce peaks in the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivity. Other collective modes belonging to the chiral p+ip order parameter turn out to be unaffected by the spin-orbit coupling but contribute to the optical response when a supercurrent is introduced. These results promise new avenues for the observation of collective modes in a variety of superconducting systems, including multiband superconductors and superconductors that feature multiple pairing channels or multi-component order parameters, such as chiral p- or d-wave superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Börge Göbel, Ingrid Mertig, Samir Lounis</p>
            <p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Scattering of a Dirac particle by a Berry phase domain wall</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lassaad Mandhour, Farah Bouhadida, Frédéric Piéchon</p>
            <p>Massless Dirac particles are characterized by an effective pseudospin-momentum locking, which is the origin of the peculiar scattering properties of Dirac particles through potential barriers. This pseudospin-momentum locking also governs the quantum geometric properties (such as the Berry phase and Berry curvature) of Dirac particles. In the present work, we demonstrate that a domain wall separating two regions with distinct quantum geometric properties can serve as an alternative to potential barriers. Specifically, using the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ model of two-dimensional Dirac particles, we show that a Berry phase domain wall results in partial reflection and transmission of the Dirac particles, despite the fact that the incident and refracted momenta are identical.</p>

            <p>We report voltage-tuned phase transitions in arrays of hybrid semiconductor-superconductor islands arranged in a square lattice. A double-layer electrostatic gate geometry enables independent tuning of inter-island coupling and proximity-induced superconductivity. This design enables access to the superconductor-insulator, superconductor-metal, and metal-insulator transitions in a single device, revealing critical points and emergent intermediate phases. We find that the superconductor-insulator transition is interrupted by an anomalous metallic phase with saturating low-temperature resistivity. Across gate voltages, this regime extends over three orders of magnitude in resistivity and can be continuously tuned into the conventional metallic phase. The signature of the anomalous metallic phase is suppressed by magnetic frustration.</p>

            <h2>Freezing line of polydisperse hard spheres via direct-coexistence simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Castagnède, Laura Filion, Frank Smallenburg</p>
            <p>In experimental systems, colloidal particles are virtually always at least somewhat polydisperse, which can have profound effects on their ability to crystallize. Unfortunately, accurately predicting the effects of polydispersity on phase behavior using computer simulations remains a challenging task. As a result, our understanding of the equilibrium phase behavior of even the simplest colloidal model system, hard spheres, remains limited. Here, we present a new approach to map out the freezing line of polydisperse systems that draws on direct-coexistence simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble. We use this new method to map out the conditions where a hard-sphere fluid with a Gaussian size distribution becomes metastable with respect to partial crystallization into a face-centered-cubic crystal. Consistent with past predictions, we find that as the polydispersity of the fluid increases, the coexisting crystal becomes increasingly size-selective, exhibiting a lower polydispersity and larger mean particle size than the fluid phase. Interestingly, for sufficiently high polydispersity, this leads to a crystal phase with a lower number density than that of the coexisting fluid. Finally, we exploit our direct-coexistence simulations to examine the characteristics of the fluid-crystal interface, including the surface stress and interfacial absorption.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Miao, Linhao Li, Hosho Katsura, Masahito Yamazaki</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) serve as important examples of ergodicity-breaking phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Despite recent extensive studies, exact QMBS are rare in dimensions higher than one. In this paper, we study a two-dimensional quantum $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model that is dual to a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ XY model defined on bipartite graphs. We identify the exact eigenstates of the XY model with a tower structure as exact QMBS. Exploiting the duality transformation, we show that the exact QMBS of the XY model (and XXZ model) after the transformation are the exact QMBS of the dual $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model. This construction is versatile and has potential applications for finding new QMBS in other higher-dimensional models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Maria Del Bono, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Francesco Zamponi</p>
            <p>Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</p>

            <p>Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), $L1_0$-ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe $3d$ electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment $m_\text{T}$, which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe $3d$ electrons. Detected finite $m_\text{T}$ indicates that the spin-polarized Fe $3d$ electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This $m_\text{T}$ of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA, and reduces the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ from the Perspective of Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guan-Hao Feng, Jun Quan, Yusheng Hou</p>
            <p>The recently discovered superconductor $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ has attracted significant attention due to its remarkably high transition temperature ($T_{c}$) under high pressure. Shortly after this discovery, thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ was demonstrated to exhibit ambient-pressure superconductivity; however, the corresponding $T_c$ is only about half that of the pressurized bulk material. This striking difference raises questions about the underlying mechanisms governing superconductivity in these two structures. To address this issue, we develop a symmetry-based method that investigates superconducting pairings solely based on experimentally determined symmetry and $T_c$, without assuming any specific superconducting parameters. Applying this approach, we find that both pressurized bulk and thin-film $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ exhibit $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing symmetry and two-gap superconductivity, yet their dominant microscopic origins are distinct. In the pressurized bulk, superconductivity is dominated by out-of-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, while in the thin film, in-plane pairing of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals prevails. Furthermore, the observed reduction in $T_c$ can be attributed to this transition of the dominant pairing types, driven by the decreased ratio of inter-layer to intra-layer hoppings in the thin film. Our result sheds lights on the microscopic pairings in $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}}$ and reveal the significance of the symmetry. This method can potentially be generalized to a broader range of unconventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>Superconducting thin films and layered crystals display a Nernst signal generated by short-lived Cooper pairs above their critical temperature. Several experimental studies have broadly verified the standard theory invoking Gaussian fluctuations of a two-dimensional superconducting order parameter. Here, we present a study of the Nernst effect in granular NbN thin films with a thickness varying from 4 to 30 nm, exceeding the short superconducting coherence length and putting the system in the three-dimensional limit. We find that the Nernst conductivity decreases linearly with reduced temperature ($\alpha_{xy}\propto \frac{T-T_c}{T_c}$), but the amplitude of $\alpha_{xy}$ scales with thickness. While the temperature dependence corresponds to what is expected in a 2D picture, scaling with thickness corresponds to a 3D picture. We argue that this behavior indicates a 2+1D situation, in which the relevant coherence length along the thickness of the film has no temperature dependence. We find no visible discontinuity in the temperature dependence of the Nernst conductivity across T$_c$. Explaining how the response of the superconducting vortices evolves to the one above the critical temperature of short-lived Cooper pairs emerges as a challenge to the theory.</p>

            <p>Hysteresis and memory effects in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) offer unique opportunities for neuromorphic computing, sensing, and memory applications, yet their physical origins remain debated due to competing volatile and nonvolatile interpretations. Here, we present a unified dynamic model that captures the essential physics of the GFET response under periodic gate modulation, accounting for both intrinsic relaxation processes and externally driven charge transfer. By modeling non-equilibrium carrier dynamics as a competition between injection and reabsorption rates, we uncover two distinct regimes: one governed by intrinsic, frequency-independent relaxation and another exhibiting frequency-locked behavior where the response is tied to the external drive. This distinction resolves apparent nonvolatile effects and explains loop invariance in floating-gate structures via displacement current-driven charge injection. Our framework predicts the evolution of the hysteresis loop shape, amplitude, and direction across a wide range of driving conditions, offering a versatile tool for interpreting experimental results and guiding the design of next-generation graphene-based electronic systems.</p>

            <h2>Scaling, Fractal Dynamics and Critical Exponents: Application in a non-integer dimensional Ising model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henrique A. de Lima, Ismael S. S. Carrasco, Marcio Santos, Fernando A. Oliveira</p>
            <p>Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.</p>

            <h2>The Hilbert-space structure of free fermions in disguise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Vernier, Lorenzo Piroli</p>
            <p>Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes \mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the Förster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</p>

            <p>We report measurements of the in-plane and interlayer magnetoresistances of FeSe. The in-plane magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{ab}/\rho_{ab}(0)$ for $B \parallel c$ is positive below $T_s$ and increases with decreasing temperature, exceeding 2.5 at $T$ = 10 K and $B$ = 14 T. The field-direction dependence indicates that the in-plane magnetoresistance is basically determined by the $c$-axis component of the magnetic field. The interlayer magnetoresistance $\Delta \rho_{c}/\rho_{c}(0)$ is negative below $T_s$ but turns positive below $\sim$18 K, which is probably due to the contamination by the large in-plane magnetoresistance. The field-direction dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance can approximately be described by a standard formula for quasi-two-dimensional electron systems except near $B \parallel ab$. The experimental magnetoresistance near $B \parallel ab$ is larger than the formula, which can be attributed to the so-called interlayer coherence peak. The large width of the peak indicates the correspondingly large interlayer transfer energy.</p>

            <p>Lithium zirconium chlorides (LZCs) present a promising class of cost-effective solid electrolyte for next-generation all-solid-state batteries. The unique crystal structure of LZCs plays a crucial role in facilitating lithium-ion mobility, which further affects its electrochemical performance. To understand the underlying mechanism governing ion transport, we employed deep learning-accelerated molecular dynamics simulation on Li2ZrCl6 (trigonal {\alpha}- and monoclinic \b{eta}-LZC), focusing specifically on the zirconium coordination environment. Our results reveal that disordered {\alpha}-LZC exhibits the highest ionic conductivity, while \b{eta}-LZC demonstrates significantly lower conductivity, closely aligning with experimental findings. The study confirms that across all phases, lithium migration proceeds via site-to-site hopping mechanism, where variations in site residence times critically impact the overall ionic conductivity. In {\alpha}-LZCs, lithium ions prefer to anisotropically diffuse across interlayers as the result of lower energy barrier, driven primarily by collective diffusion. In contrast, lithium ions in \b{eta}-LZC primarily isotropically diffuse within intralayer, hindered by higher energy barriers and determined by individual diffusion. The variation in ZrCl62- octahedral unit softening, induced by the specific layered arrangement of zirconium atoms, emerges as a critical determinant of the energy barriers across the LZC phases. These atomic-scale insights into the transport processes provide valuable guidance for the rational design and optimization of LZCs-based electrolytes, accelerating their practical application in advanced energy storage technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Justin P. Bergfield</p>
            <p>Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $Büttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.</p>

Our theory can be applied to bilayers with a magnetic insulator or with a magnetic metal. It focuses on the contribution of coherent magnetization dynamics to spin currents collinear with the equilibrium magnetization direction, but also takes into account relaxation of spin accumulation via spin currents carried by incoherent magnons and conduction electrons in F.</p>

            <p>Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration -- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev model with a conserved U(1) charge. Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity, identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism. These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.</p>

            <p>The frustrated magnet Bi2Fe4O9 has been reported to exhibit complex spin dynamics coexisting with conventional spin wave excitations. The magnetic Fe3+ (S = 5/2) ions are arranged into a distorted two-dimensional Cairo pentagonal lattice with weak couplings between the layers, developing long-ranged non-collinear antiferromagnetic order below 245 K. In order to enable studies and modelling of the complex dynamics close to TN, we have reexamined the magnetic excitations across the complete energy scale (0 < E < 90 meV) at 10 K. We discover two distinct gaps, which can be explained by introducing, respectively, easy axis and easy plane anisotropy on the two unequivalent Fe-sites. We develop a refined spin Hamiltonian that accurately accounts for the dispersion of essentially all spin-wave branches across the full spectral range, except around 40 meV, where a splitting and dispersion are observed. We propose that this mode is derived from phonon hybridization. Polarisation analysis shows that the system has magnetic anisotropic fluctuations, consistent with our model. A continuum of scattering is observed above the spin wave branches and is found to principally be explained by an instrumental resolution effect. The full experimental mapping of the excitation spectrum and the refined spin Hamiltonian provides a foundation for future quantitative studies of spin waves coexisting with unconventional magnetic fluctuations in this frustrated magnet found at higher temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling the physical attributes of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 compounds: A first-principles study for next-generation photovoltaics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Hasan Shahriar Rifat, Tanvir Khan, Md Arafat Hossain Shourov, Md Sahat Bin Sayed, Md Saiful Islam</p>
            <p>The electronic and optical properties of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 were studied using first-principles DFT calculations. Band gaps were calculated using the GGA-PBESol functional. Both materials show promise for photovoltaic applications because of their large, near-unity absorption efficiencies (10^4 cm^-1) in the visible region. They exhibit low exciton binding energies (18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications. Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 150 nm. To obtain an efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3. The best simulations show efficiencies of 18.46% and 17.35% for CdGa2Te4- and ZnGa2Te4-based solar cells, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Collective Phenomena Via the Quantum State of Interaction-Mediators: Changing the Criticality of Photon-Mediated Superconductivity Via Fock States of Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahana Chakraborty, Michele Pini, Martina S. Zündel, Francesco Piazza</p>
            <p>How are two-body scattering and the resulting collective phenomena affected by preparing the mediator of interactions in different quantum states? This question has recently become experimentally relevant in a specific non-relativistic version of QED implemented within materials, where standard techniques of quantum optics are available for the preparation of desired quantum states of the photon mediating interactions between matter's constituents. We develop the necessary non-equilibrium approach for computing the vertex function and find that, in addition to the energy and momentum structure of the scattering, a further structure emerges which reflects the Hilbert-space distribution of the mediator's quantum state. This emergent structure becomes non-trivial for non-Gaussian quantum states of the mediator, and can dramatically affect scattering and collective phenomena. As a first application, we show that by preparing photons in pure Fock states one can enhance pair correlations, and even modify the criticality of the superconducting phase transition. Our results also reveal that the thermal mixture of Fock states regularises the strong pair correlations present in each of its components, yielding the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer criticality. Besides the above QED platform, ultracold atomic mixtures are among the most promising candidates for the experimental implementation of these ideas.</p>

            <h2>A single-phonon directional coupler</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amirparsa Zivari, Niccolò Fiaschi, Lorenzo Scarpelli, Menno Jansen, Roel Burgwal, Ewold Verhagen, Simon Gröblacher</p>
            <p>Integrated photonics has revolutionized fields such as telecommunications, quantum optics, and metrology by enabling compact, scalable circuits through highly confined optical modes. Within the field of quantum acoustics, phonons have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering advantages such as lower energy, smaller mode volume, and low propagation speeds, which make them ideal for interfacing diverse quantum systems. Developing integrated phononic circuits is thus essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum acoustics and advancing technologies such as quantum computing and hybrid systems. In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device. This work represents a foundational advance toward scalable, integrated phononic platforms for both classical and quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>The generic temperature response of large biochemical networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian B. Voits, Ulrich S. Schwarz (Heidelberg University)</p>
            <p>Biological systems are remarkably susceptible to relatively small temperature changes. The most obvious example is fever, when a modest rise in body temperature of only few Kelvin has strong effects on our immune system and how it fights pathogens. Another very important example is climate change, when even smaller temperature changes lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems. Although it is generally accepted that the main effect of an increase in temperature is the acceleration of biochemical reactions according to the Arrhenius equation, it is not clear how it affects large biochemical networks with complicated architectures. For developmental systems like fly and frog, it has been shown that the system response to temperature deviates in a characteristic manner from the linear Arrhenius plot of single reactions, but a rigorous explanation has not been given yet. Here we use a graph-theoretical interpretation of the mean first-passage times of a biochemical master equation to give a statistical description. We find that in the limit of large system size and if the network has a bias towards a target state, then the Arrhenius plot is generically quadratic, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations for large networks as well as with experimental data for developmental times in fly and frog. We also discuss under which conditions this generic response can be violated, for example for linear chains, which have only one spanning tree.</p>

            <h2>Super-resolved anomalous diffusion: deciphering the joint distribution of anomalous exponent and diffusion coefficient</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yann Lanoiselée, Gianni Pagnini, Agnieszka Wyłomańska</p>
            <p>The molecular motion in heterogeneous media displays anomalous diffusion by the mean-squared displacement $\langle X^2(t) \rangle = 2 D t^\alpha$. Motivated by experiments reporting populations of the anomalous diffusion parameters $\alpha$ and $D$, we aim to disentangle their respective contributions to the observed variability when this last is due to a true population of these parameters and when it arises due to finite-duration recordings. We introduce estimators of the anomalous diffusion parameters on the basis of the time-averaged mean squared displacement and study their statistical properties. By using a copula approach, we derive a formula for the joint density function of their estimations conditioned on their actual values. The methodology introduced is indeed universal, it is valid for any Gaussian process and can be applied to any quadratic time-averaged statistics. We also explain the experimentally reported relation $D\propto\exp(\alpha c_1+c_2)$ for which we provide the exact expression. We finally compare our findings to numerical simulations of the fractional Brownian motion and quantify their accuracy by using the Hellinger distance.</p>
