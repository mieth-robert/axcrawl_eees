            <h2>Phase field modelling of the growth and detachment of bubbles in a hydrogen electrolyzer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Uriarte, Marco A. Fontelos, Manuel Arrayás</p>
            <p>We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</p>

            <h2>Hunting for superconductivity in doped triangular lattice Kitaev magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Hardy, Ryan Levy, Arun Paramekanti</p>
            <p>Motivated by exploring correlated metals with frustrating bond-dependent exchange interactions, we study hole and electron doped Kitaev Mott insulators on the triangular lattice. Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K>0$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K<0$, both vanish at sufficiently large doping, beyond which we find regimes with chiral $d\pm i d$ singlet pairing and $p\pm ip$ triplet pairing respectively. Our tensor network computations however reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM order stubbornly persists for the doped $K<0$ model, the doped $K>0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K > 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\rm sc} < 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature bond-dependent exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Unnecessary quantum criticality in $SU(3)$ kagome magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunchao Zhang, Xue-Yang Song, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Algebraic/Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of critical quantum ground states that do not have a quasi-particle description. DSLs and related spin liquid phases often arise in strongly frustrated quantum spin systems, in which strong correlations and quantum fluctuations among constituent spins persist down to zero temperature. In this work, we analyze Mott insulating phases of $SU(3)$ fermions on a kagome lattice which may realize a DSL phase, described at low energies by $(2 + 1)d$ quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with $N_f=6$ Dirac fermions. By analyzing the action of physical symmetries on the operators of the QED$_3$ theory, we conclude that the low energy DSL is a quantum critical point that can be accessed by tuning a single microscopic parameter. Aided by the emergent symmetry and anomalies of the low energy effective theory, we conjecture and present supporting arguments that the $SU(3)$ Kagome magnet DSL is an unnecessary quantum critical point, lying completely within a single phase.</p>

            <h2>Electronic correlation effects in the response of graphene and MoS2 monolayers to the impact of highly-charged ions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgio Lovato, Michael Bonitz, Karsten Balzer, Fabio Caruso, Jan-Philip Joost</p>
            <p>The interaction of highly-charged ions with monolayers of graphene and MoS2 is theoretically investigated based on nonequilibrium Green Functions (NEGF). In a recent paper [Niggas et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 086802 (2022)] dramatic differences in the response of the two materials to an impacting slow ion were reported. Here, this analysis is extended, focusing on the effect of electron-electron correlations in the monolayer on the electronic response to the ion. We apply the recently developed time-linear G1-G2 scheme [Schluenzen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 076601 (2020)] combined with an embedding approach [Balzer et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 155141 (2023)]. We demonstrate that, while electronic correlations have a minor effect in graphene, they significantly influence the electron dynamics in the case of MoS2. Our key results are the ultrafast dynamics of the charge density and induced electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the impact point of the ion.</p>

            <h2>Electrostatic gating and the interference of chiral Majoranas in thin slabs of magnetic topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Osca, Llorenç Serra</p>
            <p>We study the interference of chiral Majoranas in a magnetic topological insulator thin slab having a grounded section proximity coupled to a superconductor and another section under the influence of top-bottom electrostatic gating. The gated section locally widens an energy gap and mediates the coupling between the quantum anomalous Hall states of the leads and the chiral Majorana states of the proximitized sector. Local and non-local conductances offer measurable hints of the existence of transport mediated by chiral Majorana modes. Local conductances on the two leads reveal characteristic oscillatory patterns as a function of the gating strength, with peculiar correlations depending on the distance between gated and proximitized sectors. A gate tunable Majorana diode effect on nonlocal conductances emerges when the chemical potential deviates from zero. We suggest a protocol to identify chiral Majorana physics based on a sequence of electrostatic gates that allows the tuning of chiral Majorana interference.</p>

            <h2>Polarization-dependent chiral transport and chiral solitons in spin Kitaev models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenwei Lv, Thomas Bilitewski, Ana Maria Rey, Qi Zhou</p>
            <p>Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</p>

            <h2>Orbital-selective two-gap superconductivity in kagome metal CsV3Sb5</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Run Lv, Wenqian Tu, Dingfu Shao, Yuping Sun, Wenjian Lu</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multigap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the interplay between its multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in governing multiple superconducting gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the superconducting gap of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital weakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations reveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately -13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior experimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.</p>

            <h2>Spin-Orbit Driven Topological Phases in Kagome Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi WU, Tiantian Zhang</p>
            <p>Kagome materials have garnered substantial attention owing to their diverse physical phenomena, yet canonical systems such as the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family exhibit poor $Z_{2}$-type topological properties, spurring an urgent quest for kagome platforms hosting ideal topological states. Recently, Zhou et al. proposed the kagome-type IAMX family, which exhibits distinctive ideal topological states; however, their analysis is primarily restricted to the spinless approximation. In this work, we model relativistic effects in the IAMX family, demonstrating that tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength drives topological phase transitions and induces novel topological states, resulting in a rich phase diagram. The configuration of topological surface states evolves continuously as the SOC strength is modulated, consistent with the evolution of the topological phase transition. This suggests a viable route toward designing multi-functional topological devices. First-principles calculations performed on three specific IAMX compounds confirm that SOC governs their topological phases, in complete accord with our model analysis.</p>

            <h2>Scalable implementations of mean-field and correlation methods based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation of spin Hamiltonians in the Jordan-Wigner representation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shadan Ghassemi Tabrizi, Thomas M. Henderson, Thomas D. Kühne, Gustavo E. Scuseria</p>
            <p>Recent work has highlighted that the strong correlation inherent in spin Hamiltonians can be effectively reduced by mapping spins to fermions via the Jordan-Wigner transformation (JW). The Hartree-Fock method is straightforward in the fermionic domain and may provide a reasonable approximation to the ground state. Correlation with respect to the fermionic mean-field can be recovered based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation (LAST) with two-body correlators. Specifically, a unitary LAST variant eliminates the dependence on site ordering, while a non-unitary LAST yields size-extensive correlation energies. Whereas the first recent demonstration of such methods was restricted to small spin systems, we present efficient implementations using analytical gradients for the optimization with respect to the mean-field reference and the LAST parameters, thereby enabling the treatment of larger clusters, including systems with local spins s > 1/2.</p>

            <h2>Learning Reaction-Diffusion Kinetics from Mechanical Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Royal C. Ihuaenyi, Hongbo Zhao, Ruqing Fang, Ruobing Bai, Martin Z. Bazant, Juner Zhu</p>
            <p>A central challenge in materials science is characterizing chemical processes that are elusive to direct measurement, particularly in functional materials operating under realistic conditions. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios: classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties, including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in materials science and engineering.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling of higher-order cumulants in quantum isotropic spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shixian Jiang, Jianpeng Liu, Jianmin Yuan, Xi-Wen Guan, Yongqiang Li</p>
            <p>Understanding universal behavior of far-from-equilibrium transport dynamics at a quantum many body level is a longstanding challenge. In particular, a full characterization of universal dynamics of nonlocal correlation functions still remains largely unknown. In this letter, we uncover universal scaling laws of higher-order cumulants in one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, revealing anomalous behaviors of nonequilibrium dynamics exclusively accessible in higher-order correlations. By means of numerical simulations and full counting statistics, we determine the power laws of both the spin polarization transfer and contrast cumulants for different kinds of helix and domain-wall initial states. Building on such physical states, we unify the scaling behavior of the higher-order cumulants, giving rise to two types of dynamics: anomalous diffusive and superdiffusive. For the former, these higher cumulants show a deviation from Gaussian statistics, with the scaling exponents being identical for the first four orders. For the latter, however, we observe a breakdown of KPZ universality, with the exponents of the third and fourth orders differing significantly from those of the first two. Our results are also agreeable with recent experimental observations, advancing understanding of far-from-equilibrium transport phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Neo-Gibbsian Statistical Energetics with Applications to Nonequilibrium Cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing Miao, Hong Qian, Yong-Shi Wu</p>
            <p>Generalization through novel interpretations of the inner logic of the century-old Gibbs' statistical thermodynamics is presented: i) Identifying $k_B\to 0$ as classical energetics, one directly derives a pair of thermodynamic variational formulae \[ F(T) = \min_{E\ge E_{min}}\Big\{E-TS(E) \Big\} \,\text{ and }\ S(E) = \min_{T>0}\left\{\frac{E}{T}-\frac{F(T)}{T} \right\}, \] that dictate all the more familiar $1/T=d S(E)/d E$, $E=d\{F(T)/T\}/d(1/T)$, and $S(E)=-d F(T)/d T$ in equilibrium, which is maintained by a duality symmetry with one-to-one relation between $T^{\text{eq}}(E)=\arg\min_T\{E/T-F(T)/T\}$ and $E^{\text{eq}}(T)=\arg\min_E\{E-TS(E)\}$. ii) In contradistinction, taking derivative of the statistical free energy w.r.t. $T$, a mesoscopic energetics with fluctuations emerges: This yields two information entropy functions which historically appeared 50 years postdate Gibbs' theory. iii) Combining the above pair of inequalities yields an irreversible thermodynamic potential $\psi(T,E) \equiv \{E-F(T)\}/T-S(E)\ge 0$ for nonequilibrium states. The second law of thermodynamics as a universal principle reflects $\psi\ge 0$ due to a disagreement between $E$ and $T$ as a dual pair. Our theory provides a new energetics of living cells which are nonequilibrium, complex entities under constant $T$, pressure $p$ and chemical potential $\mu$. $\psi$ provides a ``distance'' between statistical data from a large ensemble of cells and a set of intrinsic energetic parameters that encode the information within.</p>

            <h2>Experimental demonstration of two distinct pathways of trion generation in monolayer MoS2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faiha Mujeeb, Arkaprava Chowdhury, Anindya Datta, Subhabrata Dhar</p>
            <p>Excitation power and energy dependent photoluminescence (PL) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies are carried out on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) grown 1L-MoS2 films to understand the process of trion formation. The study shows that the excitation with sufficiently low photon energy results in the creation of trions directly in the K/K' valleys through photon absorption followed by phonon scattering events. On the other hand, excitation energy sufficiently larger than the band-gap can generate the carriers away from the K/K' valleys. Dissimilarity in the rates of relaxation of the photo-excited electrons and the holes to the bottom of the K/K' valleys results in the transformation of the excitons residing there into trions. Our TAS study clearly demonstrates a temporary increase of the trion population in the K/K' valleys. Moreover, excitation intensity dependent PL spectroscopy performed under above-band-gap excitation, also suggests the coexistence of both the pathways of trion generation in this material. This conclusion is further validated by a rate equation model. Our findings provide valuable insight into the formation of trions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), which could be crucial in designing valleytronic devices based on trions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the low-energy configurations of N mutually repelling charges confined to a spherical cap and interacting via the Coulomb potential. In the continuum limit, this problem was solved by Lord Kelvin, who found a non-uniform charge distribution with an integrable singularity at the boundary. To explore the discrete analogue, we developed an efficient numerical method that enables energy minimization while maintaining the number of charges at the cap's edge fixed. Using this approach we have obtained numerical results for various values of N and cap angular widths. Based on these results, we analyze the emergence and behavior of topological defects as functions of both N and the cap's curvature.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Near-Field Hydrodynamic Interactions on Bacterial Dynamics Near a Solid Surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baopi Liu, Lu Chen, Haiqin Wang</p>
            <p>Near-field hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria and no-slip solid surfaces are the main mechanism underlying surface entrapment of bacteria. In this study, we employ a chiral two-body model to simulate bacterial dynamics near the surface. The simulation results show that as bacteria approach the surface, their translational and rotational velocities, as well as their diffusion coefficients, decrease. Under the combination of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces, bacteria reach a stable fixed point in the phase plane and follow circular trajectories at this point. Notably, bacteria with left-handed helical flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. During this process, as the stable height increases, the translational velocity parallel to the surface increases while the rotational velocity perpendicular to the surface decreases, collectively increasing the radius of curvature. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that near-field hydrodynamic interactions significantly prolong the surface residence time of bacteria. Additionally, smaller stable heights further amplify this effect, resulting in longer residence times and enhanced surface entrapment.</p>

            <h2>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in bilayer nickelates: Impact of quasi-quantum metric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seiichiro Onari, Daisuke Inoue, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.</p>

            <h2>Twist-angle transferable continuum model and second flat Chern band in twisted MoTe2 and WSe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao-Wei Zhang, Kaijie Yang, Chong Wang, Xiaoyu Liu, Ting Cao, Di Xiao</p>
            <p>We develop a twist-angle transferable continuum model for twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (tTMD) homobilayers, using tMoTe2 and tWSe2 as examples. All model parameters are extracted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations at a single twist angle (3.89°) and monolayer data. Our model captures both lattice relaxation effects and the long-range behavior of piezoelectric and ferroelectric potentials. Leveraging lattice relaxations obtained via machine learning force fields (MLFFs), the model can be efficiently transferred to other twist angles without requiring additional DFT calculations. It accurately reproduces the DFT band dispersions and quantum geometries across a wide range of twist angles. Furthermore, our model reveals that a second flat Chern band arises near 2° when the interlayer potential difference becomes comparable to the interlayer tunneling. This continuum model provides a clear understanding and starting point for engineering novel electronic phases in moiré TMDs through twist angles and lattice relaxations.</p>

            <h2>Accounting the size distribution of HTS granules for the critical current density from magnetic measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. M. Gokhfeld, Yu. S. Gokhfeld</p>
            <p>The determination of the critical current density from magnetic hysteresis loops is widely used to characterize and compare superconducting samples. Magnetic hysteresis loops for tapes and single crystals depend on both the critical current density and sample size. The latter sets the scale of supercurrent circulation. However, in polycrystalline high-temperature superconductors prepared by solid-phase synthesis or by sol-gel method, the magnetization is determined by the circulation of supercurrents in individual grains. The paper discusses the effect of the grain size distribution on the effective scale of current circulation. Log-normal and Weibull distributions are both considered as possible for grain sizes. The effective size for calculating the intragrain current density has been shown to be significantly larger than the average grain size.</p>

            <p>Adhesion plays a pivotal role in computer chip manufacturing, directly affecting the precision and durability of positioning components such as wafer stages. Electrical biasing is widely employed to eliminate floating potential and to enable electrostatic clamping. However, upon electrical grounding adhesion can persist and there is limited knowledge about the nature of this adhesion hysteresis. Here, we investigate potential causes underlying electric field-induced adhesion hysteresis at the interface between an n-type AFM tip and a p-type silicon sample using atomic force microscopy. Our findings reveal that neither charge trapping nor siloxane bond formation significantly impacts the measured adhesion. Surprisingly, we show that adhesion can be tuned through electric field-induced water adsorption under low relative humidity (RH < 10%). Our results provide new insights into adhesion hysteresis and opportunities for adhesion control.</p>

            <h2>How Machine Learning Predicts Fluid Densities under Nanoconfinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanhao Li</p>
            <p>Fluids under nanoscale confinement differ -- and often dramatically -- from their bulk counterparts. A notorious feature of nanoconfined fluids is their inhomogeneous density profile along the confining dimension, which plays a key role in many fluid structural and transport phenomena in nanopores. Nearly five decades of theoretical efforts on predicting this phenomenon (fluid layering) have shown that its complexity resists purely analytical treatments; as a consequence, nearly all current approaches make extensive use of molecular simulations, and tend not to have generalizable predictive capabilities. In this work, we demonstrate that machine-learning-based models (in particular, a random forest model), trained upon large molecular simulation data sets, can serve as reliable surrogates in lieu of further molecular simulation. We show that this random forest model has excellent interpolative capabilities over a wide range of temperatures and confining lengthscales, and even has modest extrapolative ability. These results provide a promising pathway forward for developing models of nanoconfined fluid properties that are generalizable, lower cost than ``pure" molecular simulation, and sufficiently predictive for fluids-in-nanopores practitioners.}</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lakshya Nagpal, Aditya Kumar, S. R. Hassan</p>
            <p>We present an end-to-end, symmetry-aware pipeline that converts interacting fermionic and quantum-spin models into annealer-ready QUBOs while preserving low-energy physics. The workflow combines Bravyi-Kitaev encoding, exact Z2 symmetry tapering, Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) diagonalization to a Z-only form, and k-local to 2-local quadratization, with ground energies recovered via a Dinkelbach fixed-point over the resulting Ising objective. We validate the approach across a complexity ladder: (i) a frustrated 2D Ising model run on a D-Wave Advantage QPU reproduces the known ferromagnet-stripe transition; (ii) finite-temperature checks on 1D Ising recover standard finite-size trends; (iii) a genuinely quantum spin target (XXZ) matches exact diagonalization (ED) on small chains; and (iv) interacting fermions (t-V) in 1D (rings L=2-8) show ED-level energies and the expected kink near V/t ~ 2, with a 2D 2x2 cluster tracking ED slopes up to a uniform offset. A replication-factor study quantifies the accuracy-overhead trade-off, with order-of-magnitude error reduction and diminishing returns beyond r ~ Nq. Except for the classical Ising benchmark and molecular benchmarks, experiments use D-Wave's public DIMOD and Neal simulators; a molecular benzene case in the appendix illustrates portability beyond lattices. The results establish a practical pathway for mapping quantum matter to current annealers, with clear knobs for fidelity, resources, and embedding.</p>

            <h2>Universal Machine Learning Potentials under Pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Loew, Jonathan Schmidt, Silvana Botti, Miguel A. L. Marques</p>
            <p>Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) represent arguably the most successful application of machine learning to materials science, demonstrating remarkable performance across diverse applications. However, critical blind spots in their reliability persist. Here, we address one such significant gap by systematically investigating the accuracy of uMLIPs under extreme pressure conditions from 0 to 150 GPa. Our benchmark reveals that while these models excel at standard pressure, their predictive accuracy deteriorates considerably as pressure increases. This decline in performance originates from fundamental limitations in the training data rather than in algorithmic constraints. In fact, we show that through targeted fine-tuning on high-pressure configurations, the robustness of the models can be easily increased. These findings underscore the importance of identifying and addressing overlooked regimes in the development of the next generation of truly universal interatomic potentials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Norimasa Sasabe, Yuta Ishii, Yuichi Yamasaki</p>
            <p>We investigate the microscopic origin and spectral features of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) in collinear antiferromagnets with trigonal crystal fields, using $\alpha$-MnTe as a prototypical example. Although such systems exhibit zero net magnetization, we demonstrate that XMCD can emerge from the anisotropic magnetic dipole operator $T_{z}$, arising from quadrupolar spin distributions. By constructing a complete multipole basis and analyzing the symmetry conditions under trigonal distortion, we identify specific spin and orbital configurations that enable a finite XMCD response. Further, we employ both one-electron and multi-electron models, including spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions, to calculate the XMCD spectra for various $d^n$ configurations. Our findings provide theoretical benchmarks for XMCD in altermagnets and highlight the key role of orbital symmetry and magnetic anisotropy in realizing observable dichroic effects.</p>

            <p>An exact expression is derived for the kinetic contribution to the odd (arbitrary order) frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor via a finite summation that features averages of even (all lower orders) powers of the momentum over the exact momentum distribution. The derivation is carried out for the non-interacting Fermi gas and generalized to the interacting case based on the conjecture that averages over the Fermi distribution can be substituted with averages over the exact distribution. The expression is validated against known results (first, third frequency moments) and new explicit calculations (fifth, seventh frequency moments).</p>

            <h2>Theory of tunnel magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions with hexagonal boron nitride barriers: mechanism and application to ferromagnetic alloy electrodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Kurniawan, Keisuke Masuda, Yoshio Miura</p>
            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), with its strong in-plane bonding and good lattice match to hcp and fcc metals, offers a promising alternative barrier material for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we investigate spin-dependent transport in hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$$/$$h$-BN$/$hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$(0001) MTJs with physisorption-type interfaces using first-principles calculations. We find that a high TMR ratio arises from the resonant tunneling of the down-spin surface states of the hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$, having a $\Delta_1$-like symmetry around the $\Gamma$ point. Ni doping tunes the Fermi level and enhances this effect by reducing the overlap between up-spin and down-spin conductance channels in momentum space under the parallel configuration, thereby suppressing antiparallel conductance and increasing the TMR ratio. This mechanism is analogous to Brillouin zone spin filtering and is sensitive to the interfacial distance but not specific to $h$-BN barriers; similar behavior may emerge in MTJs with other two-dimensional insulators or semiconductors. These findings provide insight into surface-state-assisted tunneling mechanisms and offer guidance for the interface engineering of next-generation spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>The interplay of nanoscale electronic domains underpins many emergent phenomena of quantum materials, including the competition between charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates, or the storage of information in phase-change memory devices. Coupling to electronic domains provides an observable for pinpointing key interactions, e.g. affecting phase transitions. While the equilibrium phase diagram of 1T-TaS2 - characterized by unique transport properties and varying degrees of CDW commensurability - has been studied extensively, an understanding of how the electronic domains in the bulk behave across phase boundaries is lacking. We reveal the three-dimensional evolution of electronic domains in 1T-TaS2 using temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space mapping, complemented by structure factor simulations based on the Hendricks-Teller method. With this methodology, we identify an increasing number of stacking faults near the phase transitions, and a growing fraction of dimerized layers in the commensurate phase upon cooling. We provide structural evidence that the CDW domains mediate the transport properties at phase boundaries, and that they also account for an anomalous intermediate electronic phase within the triclinic regime upon heating. As a paradigmatic material with potential in phase-change memory applications, our study underscores the importance of domain sizes and layer stacking in defining electronic behaviors of van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>Mott physics is at the root of a plethora of many-body quantum phenomena in quantum materials. Recently, the stacked or twisted structures of van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a unique platform for realizing exotic correlated states in the vicinity of the Mott transition. However, the definitive feature of Mottness and how it rules the low-energy electronic state remain elusive and experimentally inaccessible in many interesting regimes. Here, we quantitatively describe a filling-controlled Mott state and its interplay with superconductivity by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy in a vdW bulk heterostructure, 4Hb-TaS$_2$, that interleaves strongly correlated 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with superconducting 1H-Ta$_2$ layers. The fine tunability of electron doping induced by interlayer charge transfer allows us to continuously track the spectral function with unsurpassed energy resolution from a depleted narrow band (0.2 electrons per site) toward a Mott transition at half filling. The gradually emerging Mott-Hubbard bands, followed by the sharpening and vanishing of the central quasiparticle peak as predicted in the Brinkman-Rice scenario, unambiguously demonstrate the Mott physics at play. Importantly, the renormalization of the low-energy electrons acts destructively on the superconducting pairing potential, leaving behind nonsuperconducting, paramagnetic puddles at the nanoscale. Our results reveal a seminal system near the border of the Mott criterion that enables us to illustrate the predictive power of the Hubbard model, and set such heterostructures as promising ground for realizing new correlated states in the heavily doped Mott regime.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Classification of Altermagnetism and Emergence of Type-IV Magnetism in Two Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mu Tian, Chaoxi Cui, Zeying Zhang, Jingyi Duan, Wanxiang Feng, Run-Wu Zhang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism, particularly 2D altermagnetism (AM), has attracted considerable interest due to its exceptional physical properties and broad application potential. However, the classification of AM undergoes a fundamental paradigm shift when transitioning from three-dimensional (3D) to 2D symmetry-enforced fully compensated collinear magnetism$-$a shift that has remained largely overlooked. Here, by extending unconventional magnetism to 2D collinear systems, we identify the symmetry conditions and electronic band characteristics of a distinct magnetic phase: type-IV magnetism. This new class lies beyond the established descriptions of ferromagnetism, conventional antiferromagnetism, and AM. Type-IV magnetism supports the successive emergence of both nonrelativistic spin-degenerate and relativistic spin-splitting phenomena, belonging strictly to neither conventional antiferromagnetism nor standard AM. We further establish a universal symmetry classification framework for 2D type-IV magnets via a mapping from the collinear spin layer group to the magnetic layer group. Monolayer MgCr$_2$O$_3$ and monolayer BaMn$_2$Ch$_3$ (Ch=Se, Te) are showcased as representative materials, exhibiting gate-tunable reversible spin textures and the quantum electric Hall effect, respectively. Our work underscores the rich functional prospects of type-IV magnets, offering a new route toward spin manipulation and anomalous transport that promises innovative designs for high-performance spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>When an object is placed on a surface, friction and wear cause uncertainty in its exact position, and thus challenge precision manufacturing. Here, we explore the development of a sacrificial nanocrystal deposit that can suppress friction and wear. Amorphous \ce{CaSO4} nancrystals are deposited through salt solution droplet deposition followed by evaporation. During droplet drying, a precursor film of the aqueous \ce{CaSO4} solution spreads onto a hydrophilic silicon wafer, thus nucleating evenly spread unfaceted amorphous nanocrystals of \ce{CaSO4} on the wafer surface. We used atomic force microscopy to study the extent, topography, and friction and wear behavior of the deposited nanocrystals. We find that the sacrificial layer of nanocrystals is easy to apply and remove, spreads over large (few cm) areas with a constant thickness of about 8 nm, and has favorable friction and wear behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bradley A. A. Martin, Alex M. Ganose, Venkat Kapil, Keith T. Butler</p>
            <p>We present MACE-Field, a field-aware $O(3)$-equivariant interatomic potential that provides a compact, derivative-consistent route to dielectric properties (such as polarisation $\mathbf P$, Born effective charges $Z^*$ and polarisability $\boldsymbol\alpha$) and finite-field simulations across chemistry for inorganic solids. A uniform electric field is injected within each message-passing layer via a Clebsch-Gordan tensor-product which couples the field to latent spherical-tensor features, and perturbs them via an equivariant residual mixing. This plug-in design preserves the standard MACE readout and can inherit existing MACE foundation weights, turning pretrained models into field-aware ones with minimal change. To demonstrate, we train: (i) a cross-chemistry ferroelectric polarisation model (2.5k nonpolar$\!\to$polar polarisation branches), (ii) a cross-chemistry BECs/polarisability model ($\sim$6k Materials Project dielectrics spanning 81 elements), and (iii-iv) single-material molecular dynamics on BaTiO$_3$ and $\alpha$-SiO$_2$. The models recover polarisation branches and spontaneous polarisation, predict $Z^*$ and $\boldsymbol\alpha$ (hence $\varepsilon_\infty$) across diverse chemistries, and reproduce BaTiO$_3$ hysteresis and the IR/Raman and dielectric spectra of $\alpha$-quartz, benchmarking comparatively with Allegro-pol.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seema Chahal, Brato Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>Active Stokesian suspensions are conventionally understood to generate dipolar stresses that destabilize aligned states in the bulk and drive system-wide spatiotemporally chaotic flows. Here, we report dynamics in suspensions of torque-driven spinning chiral particles that exhibit a distinct and previously unrecognized route to collective dynamics. Using a mean-field kinetic theory, stability analysis, and nonlinear simulations, we demonstrate how flows driven by torque monopoles and self-propulsion resulting from microscopic chirality drive chaotic flows in three dimensions. Unlike the well-known alignment instability of dipolar active matter, the present dynamics is intrinsically tied to self-propulsion and relies on the emergent coupling between nematic and polar order. Our results establish a novel route to pattern formation, suggest strategies for designing torque-driven active suspensions, and provide a mechanistic framework to probe the rheology of chiral fluids.</p>

            <p>The coherent spin dynamics of electrons are investigated for CsPbI$_3$ perovskite nanocrystals in a glass matrix using time-resolved Faraday ellipticity. In nanocrystals with a diameter of about 11 nm, the Larmor precession frequency has a linear dependence on magnetic field corresponding to the electron Landé $g$-factor of 2.07. We find a finite Larmor precession frequency at zero magnetic field, corresponding to the electron spin splitting of $0.8$ $\mu$eV. This splitting is explained by the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spin fluctuations. Our model analysis shows that the hyperfine interaction for the conduction band electrons is contributed both by the $p$-orbitals of the lead atoms and by the $s$-orbitals of the iodine atoms, with the leading contribution to the hyperfine field fluctuations coming from iodine. This fact agrees well with the 9% iodine contribution to the Bloch amplitude of the conduction band, obtained by DFT calculations. From these findings, the atomic hyperfine constant for the $5s$-orbital of iodine is evaluated as 190 $\mu$eV.</p>

            <h2>Realizing an Atomtronic AQUID in a Rotating-Box Potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaspar Görg, Ludwig Mathey, Vijay Pal Singh</p>
            <p>Atomtronic devices are matter-wave circuits designed to emulate the functional behavior of their electronic counterparts. Motivated by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), atomic quantum interference devices (AQUIDs) have been developed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in toroidal geometries. Here, we propose and numerically investigate an alternative implementation of an AQUID based on a BEC confined in a rotating box potential. A ring-like topology is established by introducing a central depletion region via a repulsive potential barrier. We observe the hallmark AQUID feature -- quantized phase winding that increases in discrete steps with angular velocity. Centrifugal effects induced by rotation degrade phase coherence and impair AQUID performance, which we mitigate by applying a counteracting harmonic confinement. Phase slips are found to be mediated by a vortex propagating from the central depletion zone to the edge of the condensate. To characterize the voltage response, we induce a bias current by translating the box along its long axis while keeping the central barrier fixed. This generates a density imbalance between the two reservoirs, exhibiting a periodic dependence on angular velocity -- analogous to the voltage-flux relation in electronic SQUIDs. Our results demonstrate that rotating box geometries provide a viable and flexible platform for realizing atomtronic AQUIDs with controllable dynamics and well-defined response characteristics.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetic materials have attracted a lot of attention recently due to the numerous effects, which have an application potential and occur due to the spin-split band structure coexisting with the compensated magnetic order. Incorporation of such intriguing compounds into low-dimensional structures represents an important avenue towards exploiting and enhancing their functionalities. Prominent examples of this group are semiconductors well suited to the band-gap engineering strategies. Here, we present for the first time visible-light-emitting CdSe quantum wells, in which wurtzite MnSe as an alermagnetic candidate plays the role of a barrier. Photoluminescence experiments with temporal resolution demonstrate that in such quantum wells, a built-in electric field is present and strongly influences the energies of the emitted photons, the dynamics of recombination, and excitation power dependence. Numerical simulations allow us to estimate that the magnitude of the electric field is 14MV/m. We anticipate that such quantum wells offer potential to probe the barrier properties and that wurtzite MnSe is an interesting platform to study the interplay of the altermagnetism and built-in electric field.</p>

            <p>Living microorganisms have evolved dedicated sensory machinery to detect environmental perturbations, processing these signals through biochemical networks to guide behavior. Replicating such capabilities in synthetic active matter remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic active particles can adapt to hidden hydrodynamic perturbations through physical embodiment alone, without explicit sensing mechanisms. Using reinforcement learning to control self-thermophoretic particles, we show that they learn navigation strategies to counteract unobserved flow fields by exploiting information encoded in their physical dynamics. Remarkably, particles successfully navigate perturbations that are not included in their state inputs, revealing that embodied dynamics can serve as an implicit sensing mechanism. This discovery establishes physical embodiment as a computational resource for information processing in active matter, with implications for autonomous microrobotic systems and bio-inspired computation.</p>

            <p>We optimize the synthesis conditions for SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 (Sm1111) bulks using a cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) apparatus through both ex-situ and in-situ processes, applying pressures of up to 4 GPa and heating temperatures of up to 1600°C. A comprehensive characterization has been performed, including structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. Our findings indicate that a modest growth pressure of approximately 0.5 GPa is sufficient for the formation of the Sm1111 phase in the ex-situ process. In contrast, the in-situ process requires higher synthesis pressure (4 GPa) and temperature (1400 °C for 1 hour) to achieve the Sm1111 phase with enhanced superconducting properties. Notably, the optimized in-situ process significantly reduces the reaction time needed for the formation of the Sm1111 phase compared to conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), leading to an increase in the transition temperature by 3 K and improvements in critical current density (Jc). Conversely, the optimized ex-situ process results in an onset transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 53 K, similar to that of CSP, though it enhances the Jc by an order of magnitude. Despite these advancements, a small amount of impurity phases, as observed during CSP, persists in all Sm1111 samples prepared through either the in-situ or ex-situ CA-HP processes. These results suggest that the in-situ process under optimized conditions (1400 °C, 4 GPa for 1 hour) can effectively improve the superconducting properties of Sm1111. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis comparing these results with high gas pressure techniques, spark plasma sintering, and CSP methods suggests that a small amount of impurity phases in Sm1111 is persistent and cannot be completely eliminated by various pressure techniques, even at the applied pressure of up to 4 GPa.</p>

The dynamics of viscous flows are inherently irreversible, which violates a fundamental assumption of the fluctuation theorem. To address this issue, Gallavotti introduced a new model, the Reversible Navier-Stokes Equation (RNS), which recovers the time-reversal symmetry of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations while retaining the core characteristics of the latter. We show that for fluids on Log-Lattices, the GCFT holds for the RNS system. Furthermore, we show that this result can be extended, under certain assumptions, to the traditional, irreversible Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we show that the phase space contraction rate satisfies a large deviation relation which rate function can be estimated.</p>

But how the presence (or real-time insertion) of bolaamphiphiles influences lamellar lipid membranes is poorly understood. Using a combination of time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy, in situ small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS), and neutron spin echo (NSE) measurements, we monitor here the pH-dependent interactions of nanoscopic vesicles of a representative bolaamphiphilea glucolipid consisting of a single glucose headgroup and a C18:1 (oleyl) fatty acid tail (G-C18:1)with the membranes of an essentially cylindrical, fluid-phase phospholipid (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, DOPC). We find that the two mesophases interact spontaneously at all pH values, producing large-scale morphological remodeling. Under neutral and acidic conditions, when the bolaamphiphile assumes a cylindrical shape, vesicles fuse with one another, producing invaginations, inner tubulation and vesicle-in-vesicle aggregates. Under basic pH, by contrast, when the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and the molecule is inverted-conical in shape, the bolaamphiphile causes phospholipid membranes to undergo poration, budding, and vesiculation. This pH-dependent, environmentally sensitive membrane remodeling without the disruption of the essential bilayer motif illustrates how local, molecular-level packing perturbations can translate into global system-level morphological changes, enabling membranes to acquire environmental sensitivity and real-time adaptability. These results support the notion that molecular fluxeswhich add (or remove) amphiphilic molecules to biological membranescan endow de novo functionalities (e.g., pH sensitivity) and influence global morphologies of cell-sized vesicles.</p>

            <p>Scattering analysis offers a fundamental route to revealing particle interactions with direct implications for device technologies relying on ensembles of particles such as magnetic skyrmions. Here, we directly visualize, in real time, the nanosecond current-driven dynamics of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmion lattice using element-specific pump-probe X-ray microscopy. By tuning spin-orbit torque relative to local pinning potentials, we reveal two regimes: incoherent flow, where mobile skyrmions scatter from pinned ones, inducing recoil dynamics with 3-20 ns relaxation, and coherent flow, where the lattice translates uniformly. Quantification of the reproducible post-pulse relaxation trajectories via an inverse analyis method based on the Thiele equation yields the nanoscale AFM skyrmion-skyrmion scattering potential, which decays exponentially with a range of 30 nm, in full agreement with micromagnetic simulations. At higher current densities, the lattice exhibits coherent motion free from detectable Hall and inertial effects or dynamical deformation, enabling robust GHz operation. These findings establish a quantitative framework for AFM skyrmion interactions and demonstrate deterministic control of their collective dynamics over billions of cycles even in the incoherent flow regime, thereby paving the way for multi-skyrmion spintronic devices.</p>

The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature this http URL of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</p>

Notably, the four-dimensional (4D) QHE has been experi- mentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</p>

            <h2>Crystalline-to-Crystalline Phase Transition between Germanium Selenide Polymorphs with High Resistance Contrast</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joonho Kim, Kihyun Lee, Joong-Eon Jung, Han Joo Lee, Seongil Im, Kwanpyo Kim</p>
            <p>Understanding phase transitions between crystalline phases of a material is crucial for both fundamental research and potential applications such as phase-change memory. In this study, we investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by either global annealing at moderate temperatures or localized laser-induced heating. The highly conductive gamma-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline alpha-GeSe while preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation. The distinct structural and electronic properties at the gamma-GeSe/alpha-GeSe interface were investigated by transmission electron microscopy analysis. We propose that the clustering of Ge vacancies in the gamma-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures is a key mechanism driving the transition, leading to the formation of alpha-GeSe through the segregation of a minor GeSe2 phase. Furthermore, we observe a high electrical resistance contrast of approximately 10^7 between gamma-GeSe and alpha-GeSe, underscoring the potential of GeSe as a model polymorphic system for electronic applications, including phase-change memory.</p>

            <h2>Dispersion interaction of two graphene sheets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Davidovich</p>
            <p>The Casimir method for determining the dispersive force by varying zero vacuum energy fluctuations is applied to two graphene sheets in the approximation of the Drude model for surface conductivity. As an alternative, the Van Kampen summation method is used. The force is determined for small and for large distances between the sheets. The results of both models are quite similar. Precisely, at large distances, the attractive force decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At short distances, the force is a finite attractive one. With a small chemical potential, the force can have a minimum at distances of the order of 0.3 nm, then increases, reaches a maximum at distances of the order of 200 nm, and at large distances decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At a chemical potential of significantly more than 1 eV, a minimum is not observed.</p>

            <h2>Room-temperature anisotropic in-plane spin dynamics in graphene induced by PdSe$_2$ proximity</h2>

            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures offer a versatile platform for tailoring electrical, magnetic, optical, and spin transport properties of materials through proximity effects. Notably, hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides have been shown to induce valley-Zeeman spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene, resulting in significant spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientations. However, in-plane lifetimes remain isotropic due to the inherent threefold symmetry of the heterostructure. Here, we demonstrate that pentagonal PdSe$_2$, characterised by unique in-plane anisotropy, induces an unprecedented gate-tunable SOC in graphene. Our measurements reveal a remarkable 10-fold modulation of the spin lifetime for spins oriented within the graphene plane at room temperature. Moreover, the directional dependence of the spin lifetimes, along the three spatial directions, suggests the existence of a persistent in-plane spin texture component that dominates the spin dynamics. These findings deepen our understanding of spin dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures and open avenues for designing and engineering novel topological phases in graphene-based heterostructures within the strong SOC regime.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a platform to study and control the physical properties of low-dimensional materials. While strategies developed for two-dimensional (2D) crystals are not directly transferable to one-dimensional (1D) systems, we can benefit from them by creating layers formed by interconnected chains. Here, we develop a molecular strategy to illustrate this concept consisting of assembling 1D materials in 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Crystals of [FeX(pzX)(bpy)] (X = Cl, F; pz = pyrazole; bpy = bipyridine) consist of iron chains along the b-axis, crosslinked via bpy ligands along the a-axis to form 2D layers, stacked along the c-axis via vdW forces. This structural anisotropy manifests itself in highly-anisotropic optical properties, as demonstrated by optical measurements in the visible and terahertz ranges, results which are supported by DFT calculations. Chemical substitution enables the tuning of the optical properties, as exemplified by the photoluminescence of the Cl-derivative, which is quenched for the F-derivative. Thin-layers are obtained by mechanical exfoliation, and their optical properties are further tuned through the fabrication of orthogonally-twisted vdW heterostructures, enabling to effectively switch-off the optical anisotropy. Our work highlights the chemical flexibility of vdW layered MOFs as a platform for designing and manipulating 1D architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baraa Shammout, Leon Karpa, Silke Ospelkaus, Eberhard Tiemann, Olivier Dulieu</p>
            <p>We study the rovibronic transitions in NaK$_2$ between its electronic ground state $1^2A'$ and its second excited state $3^2A'$, to identify possible pathways for the creation of ultracold ground-state triatomic molecules. Our methodology relies on the computation of potential energy surfaces and transition dipole moment surfaces for the relevant electronic states using ab initio methods. Rovibrational energy levels and wave functions are determined using the discrete variable representation approach. A double-well structure of the potential energy surface is identified for both states, and the related transition strengths between the rovibrational levels are derived. Our calculations show that the formation of ultracold ground-state NaK$_2$ molecules is expected when starting from an excited electronic state of NaK$_2$, which can be created by photoassociation of NaK and K observed by optical means by Cao et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2024, 132, 093403).</p>

            <p>We present a versatile confocal microscopy setup for optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and multi-photon spectroscopy that enables polarization-resolved studies of semiconductor bulk crystals and low-dimensional structures. The system offers full polarization control in both excitation and detection, spatial scanning with micrometer resolution, and spectrally tunable excitation over a broad energy range from 0.5 to 4.0 eV, using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Samples are mounted in a helium-flow cryostat, allowing temperature control from 4 to 300 K. Magnetic fields up to 0.625 T can be applied in the Voigt geometry via an electromagnet. The nonlinear optical signals are analyzed using a high-resolution spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 60 $\mu$eV. We demonstrate the potential of the setup by means of SHG polarization tomography measurements on a Cu$_2$O crystal as well as through a SHG spectral scan of a ZnSe crystal over a wide energy range from 1.4 to 3.1 eV. Polarization-resolved confocal SHG mapping of various twisted mono- and bilayer MoS$_2$ structures is also presented. In addition, time-resolved two-color pump-probe experiments are shown for a Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ crystal, illustrating the potential of the system for investigating coherent exciton and phonon dynamics.</p>

            <p>We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</p>

            <p>A new frontier in condensed matter physics is to stack atomically thin layered-materials with different properties and create intriguing phenomena which do not exist in any of the constituent layers. Transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS$_2$, with an alternating stacking of a spin liquid candidate 1T-TaS$_2$ and a superconductor 1H-TaS$_2$, is a natural heterostructure for such a purpose. Recently, rare phenomena are indeed observed, including chiral superconductivity, two-component nematic superconductivity, topological surface superconductivity and enigmatic magnetic memory. A widely proposed starting point to understand such a mysterious heterostructure requires strong electronic correlation, presumably provided by 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with a narrow flat band near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the theoretically expected flat band near $E_F$ in the energy-momentum space for the first time. However, this flat band only exists on the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer with broken translational symmetry, but not on the 1T-TaS$_2$ layers buried in the bulk. These results directly challenge the foundation of the current theoretical paradigm. On the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer, we further reveal a pseudogap and an anomalous doping effect. These phenomena and the dichotomy between surface and bulk layers also shed new light on the unusual coexistence of distinct electronic orders in this mysterious heterostructure.</p>

            <p>Y3Sc2Ga3O12-Y3Sc2Al3O12 and Y3Sc2Ga3O12-Y3Al5O12 (YSGAG) solid solution single crystals with diameters up to 30 mm and total lengths up to about 100 mm were grown by the conventional Czochralski technique. Rocking curve measurements on polished sections revealed typical FWHM values of about 22 arcsec, which is indicative of relatively high structural quality for a solid-solution crystal. The grown substrate crystals are nearly lattice-matched with Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) to allow epitaxial growth of high-quality thin films. Single crystalline YIG films with thicknesses between 100 nanometer and 2.9 micrometer were successfully grown on epi-polished YSGAG substrates using liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). Selected magnetic and microwave properties of the epitaxial films, which still exhibit small lattice misfits to the substrates, were then studied at room temperature. In addition, initial low-temperature investigations confirm that the YIG/YSGAG system is superior to the conventional YIG/GGG (Gd3Ga5O12) system at temperatures below 10 K, as the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth does not increase with decreasing temperature. Therefore, the novel diamagnetic substrates are better suited for microwave applications at low temperature, as excessive damping losses induced by paramagnetic substrates can be avoided. It therefore seems to be a suitable pathway to achieve scalable microwave components for hybrid-integrated quantum systems based on ultralow-damping YIG films that can operate efficiently at millikelvin temperatures.</p>

            <p>The discovery of ambient-pressure nickelate high-temperature superconductivity provides a new platform for probing the underlying superconducting mechanisms. However, the thermodynamic metastability of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide high-temperature superconducting films.</p>

            <h2>Gapless Edge Gravitons and Quasiparticles in Fractional Quantum Hall Systems with Non-Local Confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Spasic-Mlacak, Nigel R. Cooper</p>
            <p>One of the central tenets of the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect is that the bulk quantized Hall response requires the existence of a gapless chiral edge mode. The field theoretical arguments for this rely on locality. While locality is typically met in standard experimental settings, it need not always apply. Motivated by experimental capabilities of photonic platforms, we study confining potentials that are step-like in angular momentum, and thus non-local in position. We show that this non-local potential does not host conventional chiral edge modes. These are replaced by gapless spin-2 edge states, which we show are connected to the collective 'graviton' excitations that are gapped in the bulk. Furthermore, we show that FQH states host gapless (charged) quasiparticles on their edges, even in the absence of conventional edge modes. The edge state energies vanish as a power-law in system size, with an exponent that characterises the bulk topological order.</p>

We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</p>

            <p>A Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) has been developed for the Cu-Ag binary alloy and its accuracy, transferability, and thermodynamic fidelity evaluated. The model was trained on a diverse dataset encompassing solid, liquid, and interfacial configurations derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Benchmarking against experiment and DFT data demonstrated significant improvements over the widely used classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential, particularly in predicting defect energetics, surface properties, and the eutectic phase diagram. Despite a slight underestimation of Ag's melting point, the MTP model achieved consistent accuracy across elemental and binary systems without direct fitting to high-temperature phase transitions. The predicted eutectic temperature and composition were found in close agreement with experimental observations. These results establish MTP as a robust framework for modeling immiscible metallic systems and pave the way for its integration into large-scale atomistic simulations where both fidelity and generalizability are essential.</p>

Electrical transport measurements indicate metallic behavior with electron-dominated carriers. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals multiple electron pockets and significant kz broadening due to its large c-axis and low dispersion features in k z.

            <p>Large lossless currents in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their one-dimensional geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non-metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation-mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, we propose an asymmetric stress field strategy using extrusion to directly nucleate a high-density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear-driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron-based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of nearly one angstrom trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current-carrying capacity of IBS at 33 T, along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS, but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems.</p>

            <h2>Optical Signatures of Band Flatness and Anisotropic Quantum Geometry in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pok Man Chiu</p>
            <p>We study the degree of band flatness and the anisotropic quantum geometry in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the parameters of lattice relaxation using optical conductivity. We show that the degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about the bandwidth of the two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of (generalized) optical Hall conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature, which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is slightly different from zero. Lastly, we demonstrate that the vanishing of flat band velocity and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient conditions for the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case. In contrast, the determinant condition can only be saturated in anisotropic systems.</p>

            <p>The development of wearable photodetectors demands a unique combination of broadband optical sensitivity, mechanical flexibility, and skin-compatibility, with these requirements rarely met simultaneously by existing technologies. Here, we present photodetectors that combine all of these performances. This is achieved by integrating carbon dots, engineered for extended ultraviolet-to-near-infrared absorption, with single-layer graphene transferred onto a plastic substrate. Unlike traditional quantum dot systems, our carbon dots achieve a broad ultraviolet-to-near-infrared response without toxic heavy metals. Graphene provides an efficient channel for charge transport, while a biocompatible chitosan-glycerol electrolyte enables efficient, low-voltage carrier modulation, with peak performance at approximately 0.5 V gate bias. The resulting photodetectors exhibit a broadband photoresponse with responsivities of approximately 0.19 A/W at 406 nm, 0.32 A/W at 642 nm, and 0.18 A/W at 785 nm. They maintain consistent performance at a bending radius of 0.8 cm with negligible degradation after repeated cycles. Furthermore, skin-compatibility assessments using the SkinEthic model confirm the non-toxic nature and suitability of our devices for direct skin contact. The combination of broadband absorption (400-800 nm), flexibility, and skin-compatibility, along with low-voltage operation ($<$ 1.5 V), positions our photodetectors as promising building blocks for next-generation wearable optoelectronics.</p>

The dynamics of the disturbed spring network is analyzed from the multiple perspectives of energetics, structural instability, and speed distribution. We reveal the crumpling transition of strongly disturbed spring networks and the rapid convergence of the speed distribution toward the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This work demonstrates the rich physics arising from the interplay of flexibility and dynamics. The results may yield insights into the shape fluctuation and structural instability of deformable membranes from the dynamical perspective.</p>

            <p>Many-body functionals of the Green's function can provide fundamental advances in electronic-structure calculations, due to their ability to accurately predict both spectral and thermodynamic properties, such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and total energies of materials. However, fully first-principles, self-consistent calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge, ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental measurements.</p>

Contrary to earlier interpretations proposing a transient nonpolar intermediate phase, we demonstrate that the broad transitional regions previously observed in STEM images are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, which are a characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. This is further confirmed by STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Our simulations reveal that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, directly explaining the emergence of zigzag-shaped domain walls, and is consistent with the nucleation-limited switching behavior observed in experimental switching dynamic measurements. Furthermore, we show that increasing Sc content systematically lowers domain wall energy and associated nucleation barrier, thereby reducing the switching field in agreement with experimental trends. These findings establish a direct connection between local domain wall structure, switching kinetics, and macroscopic ferroelectric behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alesanmi Richmond Rerelope Odufisan</p>
            <p>We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</p>

            <p>We present CrystalDiT, a diffusion transformer for crystal structure generation that achieves state-of-the-art performance by challenging the trend of architectural complexity. Instead of intricate, multi-stream designs, CrystalDiT employs a unified transformer that imposes a powerful inductive bias: treating lattice and atomic properties as a single, interdependent system. Combined with a periodic table-based atomic representation and a balanced training strategy, our approach achieves 9.62% SUN (Stable, Unique, Novel) rate on MP-20, substantially outperforming recent methods including FlowMM (4.38%) and MatterGen (3.42%). Notably, CrystalDiT generates 63.28% unique and novel structures while maintaining comparable stability rates, demonstrating that architectural simplicity can be more effective than complexity for materials discovery. Our results suggest that in data-limited scientific domains, carefully designed simple architectures outperform sophisticated alternatives that are prone to overfitting.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Geometric Design of Thermoelectric Metamaterials for Enhancing Power Generation: An Interpretative Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xanthippi Zianni</p>
            <p>Thermoelectric metamaterials featuring width modulation through constrictions (constricted geometries) have emerged as a promising approach for improving heat management and thermoelectric performance. Through a combination of theoretical calculations, analytical formalism, and validation against experimental data, it is shown that thermoelectric performance in such geometries is governed by two fundamental mechanisms of pure geometrical origin: (i) a characteristic scaling behavior of resistance with Transmissivity, and (ii) the critical formation of the Constriction Thermal Resistance. Hourglass-shaped thermoelectric legs - identified as optimal in recent experiments - are found to exhibit the same underlying transport mechanisms observed in other constricted profiles, including single and multiple sharp constrictions. The commonly used Geometric Parameter is found to be insufficient for capturing the full influence of geometry on transport, whereas Transmissivity serves as a robust descriptor of constricted geometry, independent of material choice or device operating conditions. A universal scaling formalism is derived linking electrical and thermal resistances, along with key thermoelectric performance metrics, to the Transmissivity. A unified optimization framework is also developed for composite legs, incorporating both constricted material and contact electrodes. This framework indicates that previously reported performance gains may be largely attributed to contact resistance, rather than geometry alone. Transmissivity is established as a key geometric descriptor, enabling generalized design principles and global optimization criteria for enhancing thermoelectric power generation. This analysis elucidates new avenues in the design of thermoelectric metamaterials for efficient energy conversion.</p>

            <p>Micro- and nanoscale fabrication, which enables precise construction of intricate three-dimensional structures, is of foundational importance for advancing innovation in plasmonics, nanophotonics, and biomedical applications. However, scaling fabrication to industrially relevant levels remains a significant challenge. We demonstrate that triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) offers a unique opportunity to increase fabrication speeds and scalability of micro- and nanoscale 3D structures. Due to its nonlinearity and low power requirements, TTA-UC enables localized polymerization with nanoscale resolutions while simultaneously printing millions of voxels per second through optical parallelization using off-the-shelf light-emitting diodes and digital micromirror devices. Our system design and component integration empower fabrication with a minimum lateral feature size down to 230 nm and speeds up to 112 million voxels per second at a power of 7.0 nW per voxel. This combination of high resolution and fast print speed demonstrates that TTA-UC is a significant advancement in nanofabrication technique, evidenced by the fabrication of hydrophobic nanostructures on a square-centimeter scale, paving the way for industrial nanomanufacturing.</p>

            <h2>Ab Initio Entropy Calculations of Water Predict the Interiors of Uranus and Neptune to be 15-30% Colder than Previous Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Burkhard Militzer</p>
            <p>Ab initio free energy calculations are employed to derive the entropy of liquid and superionic water over a wide range of conditions in the interiors of Uranus and Neptune. The resulting adiabats are much shallower in pressure-temperature space than those adopted for earlier models of Uranus and Neptune. Our models for their interiors are thus much colder, increasing the likelihood that diamond rain or the recently predicted phase separation of planetary ices has occurred in the mantles of ice giant planets. Based on our ab initio data, we construct interior models for Uranus and Neptune with the Concentric MacLaurin Spheroid method that match the existing gravity measurements. We compare fully convective models with models that include a convective boundary between liquid and superionic water. We also share a code to characterize giant planet atmospheres where para and ortho hydrogen as well as helium are present.</p>

            <p>The impact of femtosecond (fs) laser radiation on semiconductors with direct (ZnSe, GaAs, CdZnTe) band gap, with the structurally induced direct-to-indirect band gap transition (PbI2, GaSe) and indirect band gap (Si) has been studied. The fs-laser treatment of semiconductors has been performed in the multi-pulse regime in air environment. The influence of fs-laser radiation parameters on surface morphology of the semiconductors has been analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 2D Fourier transform of SEM images, optical photoluminescence spectroscopy. Under the treatment with the fundamental fs-laser radiation (800 nm, about 130-150 fs) both low spatial frequency LIPSS and high spatial frequency LIPSS have been observed. Specific features of LIPSS of two types (low spatial frequency LIPSS and high spatial frequency LIPSS) and other structure peculiarities (grooves, grains, different defects in periodic structure, i.e. loops, strip breaks, and ablation products) have been also analysed. The formation mechanisms of LIPSS are also considered within the scope of two approaches,namely an electromagnetic approach and matter reorganization processes.</p>

            <p>We study the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting, relativistic gas of charged scalar bosons in a uniform magnetic field, including both statistical and vacuum contributions at arbitrary field strengths. Focusing on the low-temperature regime and separating the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) from excited states provides a clearer view of the magnetic field's impact on thermodynamic quantities. We revisit Bose Einstein condensation (BEC), specific heat, magnetization, and the equation of state (EoS). A central result is the diffuse character of BEC induced by the magnetic field, reflected in the specific heat, which exhibits two plateaus: the first appears when the system becomes effectively one-dimensional through magnetic confinement, while the second-associated with the true one-particle ground state-is suppressed by the field. Consequently, no critical condensation temperature arises. For magnetization, the LLL contribution shifts from diamagnetic to paramagnetic As the field strengthen with the inclusion of the excited states, the statistical magnetization remains negative. In contrast, the vacuum contribution dominates at strong fields, driving paramagnetic. We also show that antiparticles enhance specific heat, magnetization, and total pressure. These effects are illustrated for a pion gas under neutron star conditions and compared with previous results for a neutral vector boson system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John B. Bell, Andrew Nonaka, Alejandro L. Garcia</p>
            <p>A multispecies diffuse interface model is formulated in a fluctuating hydrodynamics framework for the purpose of simulating surfactant interfaces at the nanoscale. The model generalizes previous work to ternary mixtures, employing a Cahn-Hilliard free energy density combined with incompressible, isothermal fluctuating hydrodynamics where dissipative fluxes include both deterministic and stochastic terms. The intermolecular parameters in the free energy are chosen such that one species acts as a partially miscible surfactant. From Laplace pressure measurements we show that in this model the surface tension decreases linearly with surfactant concentration, leading to Marangoni convection for interfaces with concentration gradients. In the capillary wave spectrum for interfaces with and without surfactant we find that for the former the spectrum deviates significantly from classical capillary wave theory, presumably due to Gibbs elasticity. In non-equilibrium simulations of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, deterministic simulations showed that the surfactant delays pinching of a fluid cylinder into droplets. However, stochastic simulations indicate that thermal fluctuations disrupt the surfactant's stabilizing effect. Similarly, the spreading of a patch of surfactant, driven by Marangoni convection, was found to be partially suppressed by thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Unitary network: Tensor network unitaries with local unitarity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenqing Xie, Seishiro Ono, Hoi Chun Po</p>
            <p>We introduce unitary network, an oriented architecture for tensor network unitaries. Compared to existing architectures, in a unitary network each local tensor is required to be a unitary matrix upon suitable reshaping. Global unitarity is ensured when the network obeys a suitable ordering property. Unitary operators represented by unitary networks need not preserve locality. In particular, we show that the class of unitary networks encompasses global unitaries which preserve locality up to exponentially suppressed tails, as in those that naturally arise from the finite-time evolution of local Hamiltonians. Non-invertible symmetries, as exemplified by the non-local Kramers-Wannier duality in one dimension, can also be represented using unitary networks. We also show that information flow in a unitary network can be characterized by a flow index, which matches the known index for quantum cellular automata as a special case.</p>

            <h2>Open quantum systems and the grand canonical ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benedikt M. Reible, Luigi Delle Site</p>
            <p>The celebrated Lindblad equation governs the non-unitary time evolution of density operators used in the description of open quantum systems. It is usually derived from the von Neumann equation for a large system, at given physical conditions, when a small subsystem is explicitly singled out and the rest of the system acts as an environment whose degrees of freedom are traced out. In the specific case of a subsystem with variable particle number, the equilibrium density operator is given by the well-known grand canonical Gibbs state. Consequently, solving the Lindblad equation in this case should automatically yield, without any additional assumptions, the corresponding density operator in the limiting case of statistical equilibrium. Current studies of the Lindblad equation with varying particle number assume, however, the grand canonical Gibbs state a priori: the chemical potential is externally imposed rather than derived from first principles, and hence the corresponding density operator is not obtained as a natural solution of the equation. In this work, we investigate the compatibility of grand canonical statistical mechanics with the derivation of the Lindblad equation. We propose an alternative and complementary approach to the current literature that consists in using a generalized system Hamiltonian which includes a term $\mu N$. In a previous paper, this empirically well-known term has been formally derived from the von Neumann equation for the specific case of equilibrium. Including $\mu N$ in the system Hamiltonian leads to a modified Lindblad equation which yields the grand canonical state as a natural solution, meaning that all the quantities involved are obtained from the physics of the system without any external assumptions.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry in an interacting Bose gas under rigid rotation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Siri, N. Sadooghi</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of rigid rotation on the spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry in a Bose gas, which is described by a self-interacting complex scalar field Lagrangian. Rigid rotation is introduced through a specific metric that explicitly depends on the angular velocity $\Omega$. We begin by determining the free propagator for this model at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. Using this propagator, we calculate the thermodynamic potential in terms of an energy dispersion relation $\epsilon_{k}$. It is found that in both the U(1) symmetric phase and the symmetry-broken phase, two energy branches emerge. In the symmetry-broken phase, they are identified with a massive phonon and a massless roton mode. Notably, rotation does not alter $\epsilon_{k}$ at low momentum. Setting $\mu=0$, we use the total thermodynamic potential, which includes classical, thermal, vacuum, and nonperturbative ring contributions, to explore how the condensate depends on $T$ and $\Omega$. We first focus on the classical and thermal parts of the thermodynamic potential and find that the critical temperature of the U(1) phase transition scales as $\Omega^{1/3}$. By identifying the (pseudo-)Goldstone and non-Goldstone modes of this model with $\pi$ and $\sigma$ mesons, we calculate the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of masses $m_{\pi}$ and $m_{\sigma}$. We demonstrate that the Goldstone theorem holds only when the one-loop (thermal) corrections to $m_{\sigma}$ and $m_{\pi}$ are taken into account. We further explore the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of the condensate, determine the $\sigma$ dissociation temperatures for fixed $\Omega$, and compare them with the critical temperature of the phase transition. Additionally, we emphasize the role played by the nonperturbative ring potential, especially in altering the order of the phase transition with and without rotation.</p>

            <p>We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Thermal Correlators and Black Holes: From Infinity to Singularity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Valach</p>
            <p>This thesis explores thermal correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) and their connection to black hole geometry within the AdS/CFT correspondence, using a near-boundary expansion as the main tool. Two themes are examined. First, we show that the stress-tensor sector of boundary correlators encodes information about black hole singularities. By resumming contributions from the stress-tensor and its composites, we uncover branch-point singularities in complex time, corresponding to bulk geodesics that cross the horizon, reflect off the singularity, and return to the boundary. We further clarify the role of double-trace operators in restoring analyticity and the KMS condition, and establish a map between bulk geodesics and OPE sectors of the thermal correlator. Second, we study thermal stress-tensor correlators in CFTs with pure gravity duals. Through holographic calculations in Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we identify a robust universal behaviour - near the lightcone the correlators are described by three universal functions. The bulk Lagrangian only affects the arguments of these functions through corrections to the cubic stress-tensor couplings and the thermal stress-tensor one-point function. We relate this behaviour to causality constraints such as the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), showing that ANEC saturation makes the correlator temperature-independent. Overall, our results demonstrate that thermal correlators - especially their stress-tensor sector - serve as sensitive probes of black hole interiors, causality, and universality in holographic CFTs.</p>

            <p>In this study, we examine the emergence of photon Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) resulting from the interaction of high-energy photons with a cold electron gas, modeled via a modified Kompaneets equation. Beginning with an initial black-body photon spectrum, we perform numerical simulations to track the evolution of the photon distribution under the influence of inverse Compton scattering, wherein photons dissipate energy through collisions with cold electrons. Our results demonstrate a pronounced enhancement of photon number density at the low-energy tail, indicative of a BEC-like phase transition. This phenomenon is further corroborated by an analysis of the entropy evolution during the cooling process, revealing that the condensate configuration corresponds to the entropy maximum, in accordance with thermodynamic principles. These findings establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for photon BEC formation in cold electron environments and underscore the significance of entropy maximization as a driving mechanism for condensation.</p>

            <p>This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. These materials experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.</p>

            <p>In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</p>

            <p>In the last few years several ``universal'' interatomic potentials have appeared, using machine-learning approaches to predict energy and forces of atomic configurations with arbitrary composition and structure, with an accuracy often comparable with that of the electronic-structure calculations they are trained on. Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems: lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy (HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models.</p>

            <h2>Structured Quantum Baths with Memory: A QuTiP Framework for Spectral Diagnostics and Machine Learning Inference</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ridwan Sakidja</p>
            <p>We introduce a compact simulation framework for modeling open quantum systems coupled to structured, memory-retaining baths using QuTiP. Our method models the bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections, interpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation, rather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over non-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and its extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we demonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth. Standard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and gradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate proximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral analysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory, simulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory flow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be eliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners, enabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for engineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework offers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems. Ultimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based spectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to extract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian dynamics.</p>

            <p>The $^{45}$Sc nuclear transition from the ground to the isomeric state at 12.389~keV, with a lifetime of 0.46~s, exhibits an extraordinarily narrow natural width of 1.4~feV and a quality factor $\simeq 10^{19}$ -- surpassing those of the most precise atomic clocks -- making $^{45}$Sc a compelling platform for advanced metrology and nuclear clocks. Here we investigate how closely the spectral width and quality factor of the solid-state $^{45}$Sc resonance can approach these natural limits. Using the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser, we confirm the isomer's lifetime via time-delayed incoherent $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ fluorescence and observe previously unreported elastic fluorescence, yielding a partial internal conversion coefficient of 390(60). The absence of a clear nuclear forward scattering signal beyond a 2-ms delay implies environmental broadening of at least $500~\Gamma_{0}$ under experimental conditions, placing bounds on solid-state decoherence mechanisms. These findings set new experimental benchmarks for solid-state nuclear clock development.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mpemba effect in parity-time symmetric systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanchen Ma, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has been demonstrated in both closed and open Hermitian quantum systems. While prior studies have linked the QMPE to Liouvillian exceptional points--non-Hermitian features emerged at the Liouvillian level, it remains largely elusive whether the QMPE can occur in intrinsic non-Hermitian systems, where non-Hermiticity is inherent at the Hamiltonian level. Here, we unequivocally demonstrate the occurrence of QMPE in experimentally realizable parity-time-symmetric qubit systems immersed in a bosonic bath. Surprisingly, we find that exceptional points are neither sufficient nor necessary for the QMPE in this context, contrasting previous findings. Specifically, we show that the QMPE persists across parameter regimes both near and far from Hamiltonian and Liouvillian exceptional points, but disappears entirely when Hermitian Hamiltonian is restored. Owing to the complete suppression of the slowest relaxation mode facilitated by parity-time symmetry, we attribute the observed QMPE to a cooperative effect of remaining relaxation modes. We obtain analytical expressions that delineate the parameter regimes supporting the QMPE. Our findings not only broaden the scope of the QMPE but also reveal its intricate interplay with non-Hermitian features beyond exceptional points.</p>

            <h2>Species coexistence in the reinforcement learning paradigm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiwen Jiang, Chenyang Zhao, Shengfeng Deng, Weiran Cai, Jiqiang Zhang, Li Chen</p>
            <p>A central goal in ecology is to understand how biodiversity is maintained. Previous theoretical works have employed the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game as a toy model, demonstrating that population mobility is crucial in determining the species' coexistence. One key prediction is that biodiversity is jeopardized and eventually lost when mobility exceeds a certain value--a conclusion at odds with empirical observations of highly mobile species coexisting in nature. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a reinforcement learning framework and study a spatial RPS model, where individual mobility is adaptively regulated via a Q-learning algorithm rather than held fixed. Our results show that all three species can coexist stably, with extinction probabilities remaining low across a broad range of baseline migration rates. Mechanistic analysis reveals that individuals develop two behavioral tendencies: survival priority (escaping from predators) and predation priority (remaining near prey). While species coexistence emerges from the balance of the two tendencies, their imbalance jeopardizes biodiversity. Notably, there is a symmetry-breaking of action preference in a particular state that is responsible for the divergent species densities. Furthermore, when Q-learning species interact with fixed-mobility counterparts, those with adaptive mobility exhibit a significant evolutionary advantage. Our study suggests that reinforcement learning may offer a promising new perspective for uncovering the mechanisms of biodiversity and informing conservation strategies.</p>

            <h2>A Unsupervised Framework for Identifying Diverse Quantum Phase Transitions Using Classical Shadow Tomography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi-Ting Ho, Daw-Wei Wang</p>
            <p>We provide a general machine learning methodology that integrates classical shadow representations with unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) to explore various quantum phase transitions. By sampling spin configurations from random Pauli measurements, our approach can effectively analyze hidden statistical patterns in the data, thereby capturing the distinct signatures of quantum criticality through their fluctuations. We benchmark this approach across various spin-1/2 systems, including the 1D XZX cluster-Ising model, the 1D bond-alternating XXZ model, the 2D transverse-field Ising model, and the 2D Kitaev honeycomb model. We show that PCA not only reliably detects and distinguishes both symmetry-breaking and topological transitions, but also enables their qualitative classification based on characteristic fluctuation patterns. Our data-driven approach does not require any knowledge of the Hamiltonian or explicit order parameters, and can therefore be a general and applicable tool for probing new quantum phases.</p>

            <p>We determined the metal/silicate partition coefficients of hydrogen and carbon, DH and DC, simultaneously under typical conditions of Earth's core formation. Experiments demonstrate that both DH and DC diminish in the presence of carbon and hydrogen, respectively, indicating their strong interactions in liquid metal. With these partitioning data, we investigated the core and bulk Earth abundances of hydrogen and carbon based on core formation scenarios that are compatible with the bulk silicate Earth composition and the mass fraction and density deficit of the core. The results of the single-stage core formation modelling are markedly different from those using DH and DC individually determined in earlier experiments, indicating that the Earth building blocks do not match enstatite chondrites in water abundance and require contributions by carbonaceous chondrites. The multi-stage core formation models combined with an Earth accretion scenario accounting for isotopic composition show 0.18-0.49 wt% H and 0.19-1.37 wt% C in the core, leading to 0.53-1.40 wt% H2O (present as H in the core) and 0.07-0.44 wt% C in the bulk Earth. Our modelling also demonstrates that up to 53% and 72% of Earth's water (hydrogen) and carbon, respectively, could have been derived from non-carbonaceous chondritic materials.</p>

            <h2>Limits of message passing for node classification: How class-bottlenecks restrict signal-to-noise ratio</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Rubin, Sahil Loomba, Nick S. Jones</p>
            <p>Message passing neural networks (MPNNs) are powerful models for node classification but suffer from performance limitations under heterophily (low same-class connectivity) and structural bottlenecks in the graph. We provide a unifying statistical framework exposing the relationship between heterophily and bottlenecks through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MPNN representations. The SNR decomposes model performance into feature-dependent parameters and feature-independent sensitivities. We prove that the sensitivity to class-wise signals is bounded by higher-order homophily -- a generalisation of classical homophily to multi-hop neighbourhoods -- and show that low higher-order homophily manifests locally as the interaction between structural bottlenecks and class labels (class-bottlenecks). Through analysis of graph ensembles, we provide a further quantitative decomposition of bottlenecking into underreaching (lack of depth implying signals cannot arrive) and oversquashing (lack of breadth implying signals arriving on fewer paths) with closed-form expressions. We prove that optimal graph structures for maximising higher-order homophily are disjoint unions of single-class and two-class-bipartite clusters. This yields BRIDGE, a graph ensemble-based rewiring algorithm that achieves near-perfect classification accuracy across all homophily regimes on synthetic benchmarks and significant improvements on real-world benchmarks, by eliminating the ``mid-homophily pitfall'' where MPNNs typically struggle, surpassing current standard rewiring techniques from the literature. Our framework, whose code we make available for public use, provides both diagnostic tools for assessing MPNN performance, and simple yet effective methods for enhancing performance through principled graph modification.</p>

            <h2>Succession of Ising criticality and its threshold in critical quantum Ising model subject to symmetric decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno, Takahiro Orito, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>We investigate a mixed state quantum criticality in the Ising model under $X+ZZ$ decoherence. In the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decohered state resides on the self-dual critical line of the quantum Ashkin-Teller (qAT) model, as a result of the specific choice of the decoherence channel. On the other hand, since the mixed state under $X+ZZ$ decoherence satisfies the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in a weak sense, the Ising criticality of the pure state can be partially preserved in the mixed system. By making use of the combination of the doubled Hilbert space formalism and matrix product states, we carry out extensive numerical study to elucidate the mixed state criticality. We find that under decoherence up to moderate strength, the mixed states on the critical line have properties of the Ising CFT, where $c=1/2$, $\eta=0.25$ and, $\nu=1$. These values of the central charge and critical exponents contrast with the ones in the $c=1$ orbifold boson CFT describing the critical state of the qAT model. In addition, we also observe the threshold of the mixed Ising CFT. The strong decoherence washes out the remnant Ising criticality and induces strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking.</p>

            <p>Quantum technologies require platforms that can coherently interface qubits with bosonic excitations. Photons have traditionally played this role in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but achieving the same goal using solid-state bosons remains challenging. Here we demonstrate strong and tunable spin-magnon coupling between molecular spin qubits and magnons in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator. Using [Gd(W$_5$O$_{18}$)$_{2}$]$^{9-}$ as the spin ensemble and CrSBr as the magnonic resonator, we observe anticrossings and coherent hybridization, realizing magnon quantum electrodynamics for the first time. Crucially, by rotating the magnetic field, we can dynamically change the magnon symmetry from linear to chiral, enabling in-situ tuning of the coupling strength. Our results establish magnonic cavities as a platform for scalable chiral quantum optics with magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Resolving how defects emerge and interact within the hierarchical structure of polycrystalline materials remains a core challenge in materials science. Grain-mapping methods such as three-dimensional X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) provide essential mesoscale context but lack the resolution to image lattice defects. Conversely, high-resolution methods like Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) capture lattice distortions but not the surrounding microstructure. Here, we introduce a transferable framework that unifies these complementary approaches into a single, non-destructive workflow. Enabled by open-source software, the method translates grain orientation and position data into precise goniometer settings for DFXM imaging without dismounting or reorienting the sample. Applied to an iron polycrystal containing 1100 grains, DFXM motor positions were calculated for all grains within seconds, enabling on-the-fly targeting of specific grains. This allows reproducible zooming from the millimetre-scale aggregate to individual dislocations. We resolve three-dimensional misorientation fields across grain boundaries with 36 nm pixel size, directly capturing grain-grain interactions within their microstructural context. Finally, we show transferability from LabDCT to synchrotron and XFEL platforms, enabling new ways of studying defect interactions across scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianxiang Ma, Valeriia Grudtsyna, Robin V. Bölsterli, Amin Doostmohammadi</p>
            <p>Understanding how biomechanical reorganization governs key biological processes, such as morphogenesis and development, requires predictive insights into stress distributions and cellular behavior. While traditional approaches focused on cell motion as a response to stress, we demonstrate that Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) -- robust attractors and repellers in cellular flows -- precede and drive long-term intercellular stress reorganization, physically governed by the mechanical properties of intercellular junctions. We show that this hidden flow skeleton correlates strongly with biomechanical metrics, bridging microscopic cell motion with mesoscopic biomechanics. Specifically, attractors and repellers mark hotspots of compressive and tensile stress enrichment (exceeding tenfold), alongside heterogeneities in cell packing. Notably, these connections remain robust across varying strengths of cell-cell and cell-substrate force transmission. Finally, by linking the attracting regions in the flow skeleton to future cell extrusion spots, we establish a direct link between cell motion and biologically significant outcomes. Together, these findings establish a framework for using cell motion to independently infer biomechanical metrics and bridge the scale mismatch between cell motion and biomechanics, potentially offering a new route to interpret mechanosensitive biological processes directly from cell trajectories.</p>

            <h2>Breaking conservation law enables steady-state entanglement out of equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vince Hou, Eric Kleinherbers, Shane P. Kelly, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</p>
            <p>We show how entangled steady states can be prepared by purely dissipative dynamics in a system coupled to a thermal environment. While entanglement is hindered by thermalization when the system and environment exchange a conserved quantity, we demonstrate that breaking this conservation law through the system-environment interaction drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady state. Such an interaction will generate multiple competing equilibration channels, effectively mimicking baths at distinct chemical potentials. When the environment also supports long-range correlations, these channels mediate nonlocal dissipation capable of generating entanglement. We illustrate the scheme in a model of two color centers weakly coupled to a spin-pumped magnet, where tuneable magnon excitations enable steady-state entanglement over finite distances. Our results outline a scalable approach to dissipative entanglement generation, rooted in the conservation structure and environmental correlations rather than fine-tuned coherent control or active driving.</p>

            <p>We find energy-dependent hysteresis in an isolated Heisenberg quantum spin system, similar to thermomagnetic hysteresis in canonical spin glasses in contact with a thermal reservoir. Analogous to zero-field cooling and field cooling in conventional magnetic materials, an annealing protocol is devised to control the energy in an isolated system. Depending on the strength of disorder, the susceptibilities at zero field bifurcate at a specific energy, which signals the presence of different magnetic regimes. This behavior is apparent both in a numerical simulation by exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve particles, as well as in an experiment with thousands of Rydberg atoms representing dipolar interacting quantum spins. The annealing protocols open a new path to explore the energy-dependent phase structure of spin systems at low energies. Our observation of a nonthermal metastable regime might indicate the existence of a phase transition to a novel state of isolated quantum spin systems.</p>

            <p>The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. More than 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. Thus, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as >90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.</p>

We discuss cases in which simple exact solutions for the flow are available.

            <p>We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk this http URL results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.</p>

            <p>We study charge $\Delta_T$ noise, followed by an examination of spin $\Delta_T$ noise, in the normal metal-spin flipper-normal metal-insulator-superconductor (N-sf-N-I-S) junction. Our analysis reveals a key contrast: while charge $\Delta_T$ noise remains strictly positive, spin $\Delta_T$ noise undergoes a sign reversal from positive to negative, driven by the interplay between spin-flip scattering as well as Andreev reflection. In contrast, charge quantum shot noise remains positive and sign-definite, which is valid for spin quantum shot noise also. The emergence of negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise has two major implications. First, it establishes a clear distinction between spin resolved $\Delta_T$ noise and quantum shot noise: the former is dominated by opposite-spin correlations, whereas the latter is led by same-spin correlations. Second, it provides access to scattering mechanisms that are not captured by quantum shot noise alone. Thus, negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise serves as a unique probe of the cooperative effects of Andreev reflection and spin flipping. We further place our results in context by comparing them with earlier reports of negative $\Delta_T$ noise in strongly correlated systems, such as fractional quantum Hall states, and in multiterminal hybrid superconducting junctions. Overall, this work offers new insights into the mechanisms governing sign reversals in $\Delta_T$ noise and highlights their role as distinctive fingerprints of spin-dependent scattering in superconducting hybrid devices.</p>

            <p>From protein motifs to black holes, topological solitons are pervasive nonlinear excitations that are robust and can be driven by external fields. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons in opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations - so-called non-Hermitian skin waves, which are typically unstable - into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We harness such non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. Finally, we illustrate this mechanism in another class of metamaterials that displays the breaking of 'supersymmetry' causing only antisolitons to be driven. Our observations and models demonstrate a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons, whereby solitons create their own driving force by locally straining the material. Beyond the scope of our study, non-reciprocal solitons might provide an efficient driving mechanism for robotic locomotion and could emerge in other settings, e.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.</p>

            <p>Breathing solitons consist of a fast beating wave within a compact envelope of stable shape and velocity. They can propagate and carry information and energy in a variety of contexts such as plasmas, optical fibers and cold atoms, but propagating breathers have remained elusive when energy conservation is broken. Here, we report on the observation of breathing, unidirectional, arbitrarily long-lived solitons in non-reciprocal, non-conservative active metamaterials. Combining precision desktop experiments, numerical simulations and perturbation theory on generalizations of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schrödinger equations, we demonstrate that unidirectional breathers generically emerge in weakly nonlinear non-reciprocal materials, and that their dynamics are governed by an unstable fixed point. Crucially, breathing solitons can persist for arbitrarily long times provided: (i) this fixed point displays a bifurcation when a delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation is struck; (ii) the initial conditions allow the dynamics to reach this bifurcation point. Importantly, discrete effects tend to stabilize these non-reciprocal breathers over a wider range of initial conditions. Our work establishes non-reciprocity as a promising avenue to generate stable nonlinear unidirectional waves, and could be generalized beyond metamaterials to optics, soft matter and superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>There has been considerable effort to mimic analog black holes and wormholes in solid state systems. Lattice realizations in particular present specific challenges. One of those is that event horizons in general have both white and black hole (grey hole) character, a feature guaranteed by the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We here explore and extend the capability of superconducting circuit hardware to implement on-demand spacetime geometries on lattices, combining nonreciprocity of gyrators with the nonlinearity of Josephson junctions. We demonstrate the possibility of the metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the modulation of system parameters is "trans-Planckian", and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. Instead of regular Hawking radiation, we find an instability in the form of an exponential burst of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales - a robust signature even in the presence of an environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/white hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: exceptional points in the dispersion relation allow for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons, at the expense of a radical change in the dynamics of the wormhole interior.</p>

Whereas Berry curvature-mediated transport effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a finite quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and enable previously unexplored strategies to design functionalities based on quantum geometry.</p>

These systems exhibit spatio-temporal patterns akin to active turbulence, driven by internal energy injection. While bacterial turbulence in dense suspensions is well studied, the dynamics in growing bacterial suspensions are less understood. This work presents a phenomenological coarse-grained model for growing bacterial suspensions, incorporating hydrodynamic equations for bacterial density, orientation, and fluid velocity, with birth and death terms for colony growth. Starting with low density and random orientations, the model shows the development of local ordering as bacterial density increases. As density continues to rise, the model captures four distinct phases; dilute, clustered, turbulent, and trapped based on structural patterns and dynamics, with the turbulent phase characterized by spatio-temporal vortex structures, aligning with observations in dense bacterial suspensions.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical patterns and nonreciprocal effective interactions in an active-passive mixture through exact hydrodynamic analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James Mason, Robert L. Jack, Maria Bruna</p>
            <p>The formation of dynamical patterns is one of the most striking features of nonequilibrium physical systems. Recent work has shown that such patterns arise generically from forces that violate Newton's third law, known as nonreciprocal interactions. These nonequilibrium phenomena are challenging for modern theories. Here, we introduce a model mixture of active (self-propelled) and passive (diffusive) particles amenable to exact mathematical analysis. We exploit state-of-the-art methods to derive exact hydrodynamic equations for the particle densities, which reveal effective nonreciprocal couplings between the active and passive species. We study the resulting collective behavior, including the linear stability of homogeneous states and phase coexistence in large systems. This reveals a novel phase diagram with the spinodal associated with active phase separation protruding through the associated binodal, heralding the emergence of dynamical steady states. We analyze these states in the thermodynamic limit of large system size, showing, for example, that sharp interfaces may travel at finite velocities, but traveling phase-separated states are forbidden. The model's mathematical tractability enables precise new conclusions beyond those available by numerical simulation of particle models or field theories.</p>

In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</p>

            <h2>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gevorg Martirosyan, Martin Gazo, Jiří Etrych, Simon M. Fischer, Sebastian J. Morris, Christopher J. Ho, Christoph Eigen, Zoran Hadzibabic</p>
            <p>Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</p>

            <p>Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behaviour of non-idealised Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. We numerically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</p>

            <h2>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators for quantum impurity problems after a quench</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijie Sun, Ruofan Chen, Zhenyu Li, Chu Guo</p>
            <p>An emergent numerical approach to solve quantum impurity problems is to encode the impurity path integral as a matrix product state. For time-dependent problems, the cost of this approach generally scales with the evolution time. Here we consider a common non-equilibrium scenario where an impurity, initially in equilibrium with a thermal bath, is driven out of equilibrium by a sudden quench of the impurity Hamiltonian. Despite that there is no time-translational invariance in the problem, we show that we could still make full use of the infinite matrix product state technique, resulting in a method whose cost is essentially independent of the evolution time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in the integrable case against exact diagonalization, and against existing calculations on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour in the general case. Our method could be a very competitive method for studying long-time non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and be potentially used as an efficient impurity solver in the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory.</p>

            <h2>Topological Amplification of the Bosonic Kitaev Chain with Non-Uniform Loss</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clément Fortin, Kai Wang, T. Pereg-Barnea</p>
            <p>The bosonic Kitaev chain is known to have extraordinary properties distinct from its fermionic counterpart. For example, it exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect -- its eigenmodes are exponentially localized to the edges of the chain -- even when the system is Hermitian. Such non-Hermitian effects originate from the fact that the dynamics of bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians is governed by a non-Hermitian matrix. In the topological phase of the model, the modes conspire to lead to phase-dependent and directional exponential amplification of a classical drive. In this work, we study the robustness of this topological amplification to on-site dissipations. We examine the effect of uniform and non-uniform losses under various configurations. We find a remarkable resilience to dissipation in some configurations, while in others the dissipation causes a topological phase transition which eliminates the exponential amplification. In particular, when the dissipation is placed on every other site, the system remains topological and the exponential amplification persists even for very large loss rates which exceed the system's non-Hermitian gap. On the other hand, we find that dividing the chain into unit cells of an odd number of sites and placing dissipation on the first site leads to a topological phase transition at a certain critical value of the dissipation. Our work thus provides insights into the robustness against losses of the topological amplification of non-Hermitian systems and sets explicit limits on the bosonic Kitaev chain's ability to act as a multimode quantum sensor in realistic lossy scenarios.</p>

            <p>We develop an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify disordered phases in a system of oppositely charged colloids. In this system, the interplay between Coulomb and van der Waals interactions leads to transitions in local structures, while the global structure remains disordered. Our method involves representing the local structures of the system as high-dimensional vectors and applying principal component analysis to identify distinct features of each phase. We demonstrate that our method results in a reasonable classification of disordered phases, which is consistent with that obtained from radial distribution functions. The interpretability of the method reveals the key characteristics of each phase and provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the unconventional phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Tunneling between Two-Dimensional Electron Layers Driven by Spin Pumping: Adiabatic Regime and Beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Modi Ke, Mahmoud M. Asmar, Wang-Kong Tse</p>
            <p>Tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems provides a powerful method to probe the underlying electronic properties by measuring tunneling conductance. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena.</p>

            <p>Over the past several years, there have been many studies demonstrating the ability of deep neural networks to identify phase transitions in many physical systems, notably in classical statistical physics systems. One often finds that the prediction of deep learning methods trained on many ensembles below and above the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ behaves similarly to an order parameter, and this analogy has been successfully used to locate $T_{\rm c}$ and estimate universal critical exponents. In this work, we pay particular attention to the ability of a convolutional neural network to capture these critical parameters for the 2-$d$ Ising model when the network is trained on configurations at $T=0$ and $T=\infty$ only. We directly compare its output to the same network trained at multiple temperatures below and above $T_{\rm c}$ to gain understanding of how this extreme restriction of training data can impact a neural network's ability to classify phases. We find that the network trained on two temperatures is still able to identify $T_{\rm c}$ and $\nu$, while the extraction of $\gamma$ becomes more challenging.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Martínez-García, Diego Porras</p>
            <p>Population annealing is a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm that improves the quality of the thermalization process in systems with rough free-energy landscapes by introducing a resampling process. We consider the diluted Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model using population annealing to study its efficiency in finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. From this study, we find an easy-hard-easy transition in the model hardness as the problem instances become more diluted, and associate this behaviour to the clusterization and connectivity of the underlying Erdős-Rényi graphs. We calculate the efficiency of obtaining minimum energy configurations and find that population annealing outperforms simulated annealing for the cases close to this hardness peak while reaching similar efficiencies in the easy limits. Finally, it is known that population annealing can be used to define an adaptive inverse temperature annealing schedule. We compare this adaptive method to a linear schedule and find that the adaptive method achieves improved efficiencies while being robust against final temperature miscalibrations.</p>

            <p>Recent studies of two-dimensional poly-disperse disc systems revealed a coordinated self-organisation of cell stresses and shapes, with certain distributions collapsing onto a master form for many processes, size distributions, friction coefficients, and cell orders. Here we examine the effects of grain angularity on the indicators of self-organisation, using simulations of bi-disperse regular $N$-polygons and varying $N$ systematically. We find that: the strong correlation between local cell stresses and orientations, as well as the collapses of the conditional distributions of scaled cell stress ratios to a master Weibull form for all cell orders $k$, are independent of angularity and friction coefficient. In contrast, increasing angularity makes the collapses of the conditional distributions sensitive to changes in the friction coefficient.</p>

            <p>Topology is an important determinant of the behavior of a great number of condensed-matter systems, but until recently has played a minor role in elasticity. We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that non-orientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon, and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply-twisted connected ribbons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariel Kempa, Markus Kraft, Jiaozi Wang, Robin Steinigeweg</p>
            <p>Since perturbations are omnipresent in physics, understanding their impact on the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is a vitally important but notoriously difficult question. On the one hand, random-matrix and typicality arguments suggest a rather simple damping in the overwhelming majority of cases, e.g., exponential damping according to Fermi's Golden Rule. On the other hand, counterexamples are known to exist, and it remains unclear how frequent and under which conditions such counterexamples appear. In our work, we consider the spin-1/2 XXZ chain as a paradigmatic example of a quantum many-body system and study the dynamics of the magnetization current in the easy-axis regime. Using numerical simulations based on dynamical quantum typicality, we show that the standard autocorrelation function is damped in a nontrivial way and that only a modified version of this function is damped in a simple manner. Employing projection-operator techniques in addition, we demonstrate that both, the nontrivial and simple damping relation can be understood on perturbative grounds. Our results are in agreement with earlier findings for the particle current in the Hubbard chain.</p>

The anisotropy of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces allows for additional terms in the viscoelasticity tensor and is manifested in transport properties, including electron and spin flows in a channel and nonlocal responses. In the channel geometry, the altermagnetic spin splitting leads to nontrivial spin density and spin current. Like the electric current, the spin current acquires a Poiseuille profile for no-slip boundary conditions. In nonlocal responses, the altermagnetic anisotropy affects current streamlines and electric potential distributions in the viscous regime. Our results provide signatures of the hydrodynamic transport regime in altermagnets, potentially facilitating its experimental studies and discovery.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Taylor Dispersion of an Axisymmetric Brownian Particle with Center Offset</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongqiang Xiong, Ryohei Seto, Masao Doi</p>
            <p>Taylor dispersion, the gravity-induced enhancement of translational diffusion during the steady settling of a Brownian particle, has so far been analyzed only for torque-free bodies (H. Brenner, J. Colloid Interface Sci., 71(2): 189-208, 1979). In this work, we extend the theory to a non-centrosymmetric, axisymmetric particle whose centers of mass and buoyancy are offset from its hydrodynamic center, so that the gravitational torque acts in addition to the net gravitational force. We study the Taylor dispersion of such particles as a function of non-dimensional parameter $\alpha$ representing the strength of the gravitational torque: $\alpha$ is zero when the centers of mass and buoyancy are at the hydrodynamic center and increases when they are offset from it. Analytical calculations show that for small $\alpha$, the Taylor dispersion is always amplified: the effective diffusivities created by sedimentation always increase as $\alpha^2$, but they start to decrease at certain values of $\alpha$ and approach to zero for large values of $\alpha$. We further analyze the transient regime of the mean-square displacement (MSD). At short times, the MSD grows quadratically with time before crossing over to the diffusive regime. The ballistic regime persists to relatively high sedimentation Péclet numbers (the ratio of the rotational relaxation time to the sedimentation time), even in the presence of a gravitational torque, indicating that such a torque does not considerably alter sustained ballistic motion.</p>

            <p>The sliding motion of aqueous droplets on hydrohobic surfaces leads to charge separation at the trailing edge, with implications from triple-line friction to hydrovoltaic energy generation. Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop.

Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We interpret our observations in the framework of molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a distinct state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport, electrified matter and wetting dynamics at interfaces.</p>

Starting from the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we obtain equations of motion for the retarded and lesser electronic Green's functions including contributions due to the phonon dynamics up to second order in the electron-phonon coupling strength. The resulting equations assume that the system's phonon follow classical time-local dynamics with delta-correlated noise. We apply our method to the study of the charging/discharging of a periodically driven quantum dot, and a three-level model for a single-electron pump, analyzing the signatures in the transient current, electron population and process performance of the phonon dynamics. For these systems, we adopt the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and consider external harmonic driving of the phonon at frequencies comparable with the electron modulation, and different scenarios, varying electron-phonon coupling strength, coupling to the electron part of the system, and in phase and anti-phase driving. Our results illustrate that our method provides an efficient protocol to describe the effects of nuclear motion in ultrafast transient phenomena.</p>

            <p>In Szilard's engine, a demon measures a one-particle gas and applies feedback to extract work from thermal fluctuations, embodying Maxwell's notion that information reduces thermodynamic entropy - an apparent second-law violation. The Landauer-Bennett Thesis resolves this paradox by requiring the demon to record the measurement, which results in an entropy increase in the demon's memory. Eventually, the demon's memory needs to be erased. The erasure costs the same work as extracted previously, hence there is no violation of the second law. Though widely accepted, the fictitious memory invoked in the thesis has drawn multiple criticisms, with debates persisting over the demon's necessity. We show that the demon is the piston that partitions the space and drives the expansion. The final position of the piston after expansion records the particle's position pre-expansion: it is an ``information-bearing degree of freedom''. In this Piston-Demon Thesis, memory register and feedback (expansion) happen simultaneously. Our exposition identifies the mischievous demon as a physical degree of freedom, and greatly simplifies Szilard's engine. It also offers educators a tangible illustration of information-thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>The possibility of driving vortex lines with an oscillating magnetic field could be useful in many applications. For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>MXenes, a family of 2D transition metal compounds, have emerged as promising materials due to their unique electronic properties and tunable surface chemistry. However, the translation of these nanoscale properties into macroscopic devices is constrained by suitable cross-linking strategies that enable both processability and controlled inter-flake charge transport. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was first used to stabilize MXenes in chloroform, followed by diamine-mediated cross-linking to tune precisely the interlayer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD/GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine-crosslinked Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. The dominating charge transport mechanism is variable range hopping (VRH) in accordance with the structure analysis of the films. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing in MXene composites, observing pronounced water sensitivity and selectivity, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Insights into molecular cross-linking and its impact on charge transport open avenues for next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.</p>

The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of this model to complex Sn-S-Se compound structures. Utilizing locally trained DOS is shown to significantly enhance the accuracy of predicting material properties, including band energy, Fermi energy, heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility. Our findings indicate that directly learning atomic DOS, rather than structural DOS, improves the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of machine learning in structure-property mapping.

As the exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, the critical current displays periodic resonance peaks. These peaks occur under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)} d_{1(2)} = \left(n_{1(2)} + 1/2\right) \pi$, where $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ is the center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, with $v_F$ being the Fermi velocity, and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. It can be inferred that the potential barrier suppresses the transport of spin-singlet pairs while allowing spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis to pass through. As these spin-triplet pairs traverse the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers, the total phase they acquire determines the ground state of the Josephson junction. At the resonance peaks, the Josephson current primarily arises from the first harmonic in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations. However, in perpendicular configurations, the second harmonic becomes more significant. In scenarios where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while allowing it to persist in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.</p>

            <h2>Kinetic roughening transition of ice crystals and its implications during recrystallization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge H. Melillo, Ido Braslavsky</p>
            <p>Hypothesis Roughening transitions at solid-liquid interfaces govern crystal morphology in diverse systems. In ice crystallization, these transitions control interfacial faceting and surface kinetics. Faceted morphologies are often associated with ice-active molecules, which inhibit recrystallization and are essential for cryopreservation. We hypothesize that kinetic roughening transitions can induce faceting even in the absence of ice-active agents, particularly at high solute concentrations with depressed melting points, potentially complicating the interpretation of crystal morphology as an indicator of ice activity. Experiments We investigated the kinetic roughening transition of ice in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proline-water solutions using cryomicroscopy and real-time image analysis. Crystals grew in microdroplets, maintaining near-equilibrium conditions as solute concentration increased during growth due to conversion of liquid water to ice. Antifreeze protein type III (AFPIII) was applied to distinguish intrinsic roughening from adsorption-mediated effects. Findings A distinct kinetic roughening transition temperature (TR = -16.0 +/- 0.2 oC) was identified, marking a shift from rounded disks at higher temperatures to faceted hexagonal plates at lower temperatures, independent of solute type. Recrystallization below TR revealed asymmetry between growth and melting interfaces. AFPIII promoted faceting even above TR, consistent with stabilization of step edges and elevation of the roughening transition temperature. These results clarify the interplay between intrinsic interface kinetics and molecular adsorption, with implications for interpreting ice morphology, surface roughening, and cryopreservation design.</p>

            <h2>An Ultra-Sub-Wavelength Microwave Polarization Switching Antenna for Covert Communication Implemented With Directed Surface Acoustic Waves in an Artificial Multiferroic Magnonic Crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raisa Fabiha, Erdem Topsakal, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>Polarization switches are of great technological interest because of their many applications in long distance electromagnetic communication (e.g., polarization division multiplexing). Binary bits can be encoded in the two orthogonal polarizations and transmitted from point to point. Polarization switches, however, are usually much larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave that they transmit. Consequently, most research in this area has focused on the optical regime where the wavelength is relatively short (~1 micron), so that the switch being much larger than the wavelength is not too inconvenient. However, this changes in the microwave regime where the wavelength is much larger (typically > 1 cm). That makes a microwave ultra-sub-wavelength polarization switch very attractive. Here, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, such a switch made of an array of magnetostrictive nanomagnets (~100 nm lateral dimension, ~5 nm thickness) deposited on a piezoelectric substrate to make an "artificial multiferroic magnonic crystal (AMMC)" is reported. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) launched in the substrate with suitable electrodes excites confined spin waves in the nanomagnets via phonon-magnon coupling, which then radiate electromagnetic waves in space via magnon-photon coupling. In some particular direction(s), determined by the AMMC parameters, the polarization of the beam at a given frequency can be rotated through ~90 degrees by switching the direction of SAW propagation in the piezoelectric substrate between two mutually orthogonal directions via activation of two different pairs of SAW launching electrodes. By aligning the transmitter and the receiver along such a direction (known only to authorized users), one can communicate covertly from point to point, without the need for encryption or cryptography.</p>

            <p>We studied InSb quantum well devices using Landau level tunneling spectroscopy through a three-terminal differential conductance technique. This method is similar to filled state scanning tunneling microscopy but uses a stationary contact instead of a mobile tip to analyze the two-dimensional electron system. Applying magnetic fields up to 15 T, we identified clear peaks in the differential current-voltage profiles, indicative of Landau level formation. By examining deviations from the expected Landau fan diagram, we extract an absolute value for the exchange-induced energy shift. Through an empirical analysis, we derive a formula describing the exchange shift as a function of both magnetic field strength and electron filling. Our findings indicate that the emptying of the $\nu=2$ and $\nu=3$ Landau levels causes an exchange interaction energy shift in the $\nu=1$ level. Unlike prior studies that infer level energies relative to one another and report oscillatory g-factor behavior, our method references the energy of the Landau levels above the filled states of the contact under a bias voltage, revealing that only the ground state Landau level experiences a measurable exchange shift.</p>

            <p>We study pseudogap behavior in a metal near an antiferromagnetic instability and apply the results to electron-doped cuprates. We associate pseudogap behavior with thermal magnetic fluctuations and compute the fermionic self-energy along the Fermi surface beyond Eliashberg approximation. We analyze the spectral function as a function of frequency (energy distribution curves, EDC) and momentum (momentum distribution curves, MDC). We show that the EDC display pseudogap behavior with peaks at a finite frequency at all momenta. On the other hand, MDC peaks disperse within the pseudogap, ending at a gossamer Fermi surface. We analyze magnetically-mediated superconductivity and show that thermal fluctuations almost cancel out in the gap equation, even when the self-energy is obtained beyond the Eliashberg approximation. We favorably compare our results with recent ARPES study [K-J Xu et al, Nat. Phys. 19, 1834-1840 (2023)].</p>

            <p>Chalcohalides are an emerging family of semiconductors with irresistible material properties, shaped by the intricate interplay between their unique structural chemistry and vibrational dynamics. Despite their promise for next-generation solar energy conversion devices, their intrinsic optoelectronic properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we focus on the (Sb,Bi)(S,Se)(Br,I) system, a subset of compounds that share the same quasi-1D crystal structure. Using a two-step physical vapor deposition (PVD) process, we synthesize the eight ternary chalcohalide compounds, demonstrating bandgaps ranging from 1.38 to 2.08 eV with sharp, single-component photoluminescence (PL) peaks. In a parallel exploration of carrier dynamics and intrinsic electron-phonon interactions -- comprehensively studied using power-, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL measurements -- we map their direct impact on optoelectronic performance. Supported by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) defect calculations, we establish clear structure-property relations, identifying solid-solutions engineering as an effective means to fine-tune the native phonon structures and further suppress non-radiative recombination. This study provides a blueprint for optimizing chalcohalides as high-efficiency materials across a wide range of optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <p>Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation high-speed and highly integrated spintronic devices, owing to their exceptional properties such as high driving velocity, nanoscale dimensions, and the absence of the skyrmion Hall effect. In this work, we report the observation of the topological Hall effect in both compensated and non-compensated synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion systems based on [Pt/Co/Ru]2 bilayers. The antiferromagnetic skyrmions are demonstrated to be robust in these synthetic antiferromagnets under zero-field. Our first principal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the formation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY coupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the Pt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co layers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only provides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY coupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the SAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application of antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Schmidt, J. Wawra, D. Hensel, M.Brede, R. Hühne, P. Gaal</p>
            <p>The pyroelectric effect in ferroelectric thin films is typically composed of different contributions, which are difficult to disentangle. In addition, clamping to the substrate interface plays an important role. We studied epitaxial (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ thin films grown on NdScO$_3$ to see if time-resolved measurements can shed more light on the complex interaction. In particular, we compare standard measurements of the pyroelectric coefficient by temperature-dependent hysteresis loops to transient deformation measurements on picosecond timescales in the same material. The advantage of the time-resolved approach lies in its increased sensitivity in thin films compared to that of polarization hysteresis measurements. Whereas a fast thermal expansion of the ferroelectric thin film was observed after femtosecond laser excitation of the intermediate SrRuO$_3$ layer, heat diffusion simulations reveal frustration of the thermal expansion, which might be explained with the charge dynamics at the Schottky barrier formed at the SrRuO$_3$/(Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. More studies are required to quantitatively assess the individual contributions to the pyroelectric coefficient of the materials used in our layer architecture.</p>

            <h2>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit Sharma, Srikanth Sastry, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</p>

            <p>The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</p>

            <p>Critical phenomena on scale-free networks with a degree distribution $p_k \sim k^{-\lambda}$ exhibit rich finite-size effects due to its structural heterogeneity. We systematically study the finite-size scaling of percolation and identify two distinct crossover routes to mean-field behavior: one controlled by the degree exponent $\lambda$, the other by the degree cutoff $K \sim V^{\kappa}$, where $V$ is the system size and $\kappa \in [0,1]$ is the cutoff exponent. Increasing $\lambda$ or decreasing $\kappa$ suppresses heterogeneity and drives the system toward mean-field behavior, with logarithmic corrections near the marginal case. These findings provide a unified picture of the crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous criticality. In the crossover regime, we observe rich finite-size phenomena, including the transition from vanishing to divergent susceptibility, distinct exponents for the shift and fluctuation of pseudocritical points, and a numerical clarification of previous theoretical predictions.</p>

            <p>Phonon drag may be harnessed for thermoelectric generators and devices. Here, we demonstrate the geometric control of the phonon-drag contribution to the thermopower. In nanometer-thin electrically conducting $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films homoepitaxially-grown on insulating substrates it is enhanced from -0,4 mV/K to up to -3 mV/K at 100 K by choice of the film thickness. Analysis of the temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients reveal that a crossover from three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional electron-phonon interaction occurs for film thicknesses below 75~nm. The ratio of phonon-phonon to electron-phonon relaxation times in these confined structures is $10$ times larger than that of bulk. Generally the phonon drag can be tuned depending on the relations between the phonon-drag interaction length $\lambda_\text{PD}$, the phonon mean free path $\lambda$ and the film thickness $d$. Phonon drag can be enhanced for $\lambda_\text{PD}\gg\lambda>d$.</p>

            <p>We prove a no-go theorem: generic quadratic open fermionic systems governed by Lindblad master equations do not host dissipation-free topological edge states protected by the dissipation gap. By analogy with topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindblad generator to a first-quantized non-Hermitian matrix representation that plays the role of a band Hamiltonian. Edge modes of this matrix with vanishing real part are exactly dissipation-free. We show that this matrix is always adiabatically deformable, through a symmetry-preserving path, to a topologically trivial Hermitian matrix. Hence no symmetry-protected, dissipation-free edge modes exist in quadratic open fermions. Our results apply to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians and require only a gapped bulk and a bounded spectrum. They establish a clear boundary for robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Marciani</p>
            <p>The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri Poincaré 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of lattices endowed with a Hamiltonian whose translation group $G$ is generic and possibly non-commutative. We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. A one-body dynamics emulates that of a particle carrying a superposition of charges, each coupled to distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup $C \subset G$, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of $C$ in $G$. The role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics is analyze in depth assuming $C$ finite. We discuss a theorem of direct engineering relevance that, for any cyclic gauge group, yields all compatible translation groups. We then construct two-dimensional examples of Cayley-crystals equivalent to square lattices threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Importantly, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.</p>

            <p>The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers. Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space. We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales. Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobumasa Ishida, Yoshihiko Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations establish fundamental trade-offs between the precision achievable in quantum systems and associated thermodynamic quantities such as entropy production or dynamical activity. While foundational, empirical demonstrations have thus far been confined to specific cases, either assuming time-reversal symmetry or involving particular measurement types, leaving the verification of their universal validity unrealized. This work leverages a quantum computer to report the first empirical verification of a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation, valid for arbitrary dynamics and observables. We theoretically derive the relation, revealing survival activity as the pivotal thermodynamic quantity governing the precision bound. The verification is demonstrated on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor, which is treated as a real thermodynamic system. To achieve accurate results despite substantial device errors, we introduce a generic protocol for measuring survival activity and employ circuit reduction techniques based on the relation's properties. This strategy allows us to empirically identify survival activity for the first time and confirm the derived relation. Furthermore, the quantum computer's versatility enables the implementation of optimal observables, leading to the saturation of the relation and demonstrating the sharpness of our bound on a physical device. The method's broad applicability is further illustrated by verifying the trade-off for quantum time correlators. Our findings establish quantum computers as effective platforms for investigating fundamental thermodynamic trade-off relations.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems used for metrology can offer enhanced precision over their classical counterparts. The design of quantum sensors can be optimized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which characterizes the precision of parameter estimation for an ideal measurement. Here we consider the response of a quantum system as a means to estimate the strength of a weak external perturbation. General expressions for the QFI in the nonequilibrium steady-state are derived, which hold for arbitrary interacting many-body systems at finite or zero temperature, and can be related to susceptibilities or linear-response transport coefficients. For quantum dot nanoelectronics devices, we show that electron interactions can lead to *exponential* scaling of the QFI with system size, highlighting that quantum resources can be utilized in the full Fock space. The precision estimation of voltages and fields can also be achieved by practical measurements. In particular, we show that current-based metrology in quantum circuits can leverage many-body effects for enhanced sensing.</p>

While classical computing often struggles with complex instances, quantum optimization emerges as a promising alternative. Here, we present an enhanced bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm to address higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO). We apply BF-DCQO to a HUBO problem featuring three-local terms in the Ising spin-glass model, validated experimentally using 156 qubits on an IBM quantum processor. In the studied instances, our results outperform standard methods such as the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, quantum annealing, simulated annealing, and Tabu search. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of the feasibility of a similar HUBO problem on a 433-qubit Osprey-like quantum processor. Finally, we solve denser instances of the MAX 3-SAT problem in an IonQ emulator.

Our strategy is to insert tiny truncated Belavin-Polyakov profiles in carefully chosen locations of lower degree objects such that the total energy increase lies strictly below the expected Dirichlet energy contribution, ruling out loss of degree in the limits of minimizing sequences. The argument requires that the domain be either sufficiently large or sufficiently slender to accommodate a prescribed degree. We also show that these higher degree minimizers concentrate on point-like skyrmionic configurations in a suitable parameter regime.</p>

            <h2>Gibbons-Hawking action for electrically charged black holes in the canonical ensemble and Davies' thermodynamic theory of black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tiago V. Fernandes, José P. S. Lemos</p>
            <p>We establish the connection between the Gibbons-Hawking Euclidean path integral approach applied to the canonical ensemble of a Reissner-Nordström black hole and the thermodynamic theory of black holes of Davies. We build the ensemble, characterized by a reservoir at infinity at temperature $T$ and electric charge $Q$, in $d$ dimensions. The Euclidean path integral yields the action and partition function. In zero loop, we uncover two solutions, one with horizon radius $r_{+1}$ the least massive, the other with $r_{+2}$, both meeting at a saddle point with radius $r_{+s}$ at temperature $T_s$. We derive the thermodynamics, finding that the heat capacity diverges at the turning point $T_s$ for each solution. The free energy of the stable solution is positive, so if the system is a black hole it makes a transition to hot flat space with charge at infinity. For a given $Q$ and $T>T_s$, there is only hot space. An interpretation of the results as energy wavelengths is attempted. For $d=4$, the thermodynamics from the path integral applied to the canonical ensemble is precisely the Davies thermodynamics theory of black holes, with $T_s$ being the Davies point. We sketch the case $d=5$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevissen Sellapillay, Laurent Raymond, Alberto D. Verga</p>
            <p>We investigate the entanglement of a ladder of spins formed by two sublattices, a ''cluster'' chain and the ''environment'', consisting of independent spins, both coupled by an exchange interaction and evolving under a unitary discrete time dynamics. The automaton is defined by the composition of the two body spin swap gate (between sublattices) and the three body cluster interaction. We observe that, depending on the set of coupling constants, the cluster subsystem evolves towards states corresponding to different entanglement phases. In the weak coupling regime the subsystem remains near the topological cluster state. Increasing the coupling strength leads to random states which transform from almost pure to fully mixed, according to the effective number of the environment active degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>The magnetic line defect in the $O(N)$ model gives rise to a non-trivial one-dimensional defect conformal field theory of theoretical and experimental value. This model is considered here in $d=4-\varepsilon$ and the full spectrum of defect operators with dimensions close to one, two and three at order $\varepsilon$ is presented. The spectrum of several classes of operators of dimension close to four and operators of large charge are also discussed. Analytic bootstrap techniques are used extensively, and efficient tools to deal with the unmixing of nearly degenerate operators are developed. Integral identities are also incorporated, and it is shown that they lead to constraints on some three-point function coefficients and anomalous dimensions to order $\varepsilon^2$.</p>

            <h2>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</p>

            <h2>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe</p>
            <p>We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.M. Ahmadi-Jahmani, A. Parvizi</p>
            <p>Fractons, characterized by restricted mobility and governed by higher-moment conservation laws, represent a novel phase of matter with deep connections to tensor gauge theories and emergent gravity. This work systematically explores the duality between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles-Carroll and Galilean-within electromagnetic (EM) fields. By constructing canonical actions for fractons in rank-2 gauge fields, we derive their equations of motion and demonstrate a new set of dualities between fractons and non-Lorentzian particles in gauge fields. The algebraic underpinnings of these dualities are clarified through symmetry analyses, revealing structural parallels between the fracton and Carroll/Galilean algebras. Furthermore, by gauging the fracton algebra, we develop a framework for coupling fracton gauge fields and background geometry, linking them to non-Lorentzian spacetimes and deriving the corresponding constraint on geometry. These results unify fracton dynamics with non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic limits of physics, offering insights into emergent gravity and exotic condensed matter systems.</p>

The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michela Lapenna, Caterina De Bacco</p>
            <p>Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</p>

            <p>We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the purification rate are also obtained.</p>

            <p>Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.</p>

            <h2>Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Xi Foo, Aisha Kermiche, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Clarice D. Aiello, Luke D. Smith</p>
            <p>The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</p>

We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manish Kumar, Bharadwaj Vedula, Suhas Gangadharaiah, Auditya Sharma</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase -- a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.</p>

            <p>Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a promising platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum phases, enabled by its Berry-curvature-bearing flat bands. While prior work has focused on separated conduction and valence bands, we probe the extensive semimetallic regime of rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. We survey a rich phase diagram dominated by flavor-symmetry breaking and reveal an electric-field-driven band inversion through fermiology. Near this inversion, we find a superconducting-like state confined to a region with emergent electron and hole Fermi surfaces. In addition, two multiferroic orbital-magnetic phases are observed: a ferrovalley state near zero field and a ferroelectric state at large fields around charge neutrality. The latter shows electric-field-reversible magnetic hysteresis, consistent with a $\Delta P \cdot M$ multiferroic order parameter. Our fermiology analysis elucidates the correlated semimetal regime in rhombohedral graphene and underscores its potential to host diverse quantum phases.</p>

            <p>One main limiting factor towards achieving high coherence times in superconducting circuits is two level system (TLS) losses. Mitigating such losses requires controlling the formation of native oxides at the metal-air interface. Here, we report the growth of alkyl-phosphonate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Nb thin films following oxide removal. The impact of passivation was evaluated via the performance of coplanar waveguide resonators at 10mK, in terms of quality factor and resonant frequency, over six days of air exposure. Un-passivated resonators exhibited an ~80% increase in loss at single-photon power levels, whereas SAM-passivated resonators maintained excellent temporal stability, attributed to suppressed oxide regrowth. By employing a two-component TLS model, we discern distinct prominent loss channels for each resonator type and quantified the characteristic TLS loss of the SAMs to be ~5x10^-7. We anticipate our passivation methodology to offer a promising route toward industrial-scale qubit fabrication, particularly where long-term device stability is critical.</p>

            <p>High temperature superconductivity is typically associated with strong coupling and a large superconducting gap, yet these characteristics have not been demonstrated in the nickelates. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Eu substitution in the spacer layer of Nd1-xEuxNiO2 (NENO) thin films enhances the superconducting gap, driving the system toward a strong-coupling regime. This is accompanied by a magnetic-exchange-driven magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. We investigate the upper critical magnetic field, Hc2, and superconducting gap of superconducting NENO thin films with x=0.2 to 0.35. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity in NENO films. We interpret this phenomenon as a result of interaction between magnetic Eu ions and superconducting states in the Ni dx2-y2 orbital. The upper critical magnetic field strongly violates the weak-coupling Pauli limit. Infrared spectroscopy confirms a large gap-to-Tc ratio $2 \Delta k_B T_c \approx 5 - 6$, indicating a stronger coupling pairing mechanism in NENO relative to the Sr-doped NdNiO2. The substitution of Eu in the rare-earth layer provides a method to modify the superconducting gap in Nd-based nickelates, an essential factor in engineering high-Tc superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</p>

            <p>The additional layer degree of freedom in trilayer moiré superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenides enables the emergence of novel excitonic species, such as quadrupolar excitons, which exhibit unique excitonic interactions and hold promise for realizing intriguing excitonic phases and their quantum phase transitions. Concurrently, the presence of strong electronic correlations in moiré superlattices, as exemplified by the observations of Mott insulators and generalized Wigner crystals, offers a direct route to manipulate these new excitonic states and resulting collective excitonic phases. Here, we demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton and electron-exciton interactions, both stemming from robust electron correlations, can be harnessed to controllably drive transitions between quadrupolar and dipolar excitons. This is achieved by tuning either the exciton density or electrostatic doping in a trilayer semiconducting moiré superlattice. Our findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of quadrupolar excitons but also usher in new avenues for exploring and engineering many-body quantum phenomena through novel correlated excitons in semiconducting moiré systems.</p>

Using nonlinear response theory, we show that magnon spin current can be generated by both linearly and circularly polarized electromagnetic waves via one-magnon processes. While linearly polarized waves induce a spin current even in the absence of a static magnetic field, circularly polarized waves lead to a spin current only when a static field is present, and the current reverses its direction upon field inversion. The distinct dependence on the external magnetic field and the contrasting responses to different polarizations allow the spin photocurrent to be differentiated from competing effects such as spin pumping or inhomogeneous heating, facilitating experimental verification. These results suggest that Cr2O3 is a promising candidate for experimental studies of magnon photocurrent.</p>

Here, we demonstrate high field-stabilized superconductivity in a class of materials with a significantly higher Tc (up to 40 K): the infinite-layer nickelates [6]. Both low-field and high-field superconducting states can be plausibly explained by a compensation mechanism akin to the Jaccarino-Peter effect.

            <p>We investigate dissipation-driven topological phase transitions in one-dimensional quantum open systems governed by the Lindblad equation with linear dissipation operators, which ensure the density matrix retains its Gaussian form throughout the dynamics. By employing the modular Hamiltonian framework, we rigorously demonstrate that the $\rm{Z}_2$ topological invariant characterizing steady states in one-dimensional class D systems is exclusively dependent on the dissipation operators, rather than the system Hamiltonian. Through a quench protocol where the system evolves from the steady state of one Lindbladian to another, we reveal that topological transitions can occur at analytically predictable critical times, even when the initial and final steady states share identical topological indices. These transitions are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to depend solely on dissipation parameters. Entanglement spectrum analysis demonstrates bulk-edge correspondence in non-equilibrium density matrices via coexisting single-particle gap closures (periodic boundaries) and topologically protected zero modes (open boundaries), directly underpinning the detection of dissipation-induced topology in quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Berry Curvature Induced Spin Nernst and Thermal Edelstein Effects in Proximity Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Cheng Liao, Cong Xiao, Zhi Wang, Qian Niu</p>
            <p>We propose two thermo-spintronic responses in proximity induced superconductors with spin-orbit coupled band - spin Nernst effect and thermal Edelstein effect stemming respectively from momentum-space and mixed superconducting Berry curvatures. We unveil that the Bloch band spin-orbit coupling and pairing are entangled in shaping the superconducting Berry curvatures rather than in an additive manner. The resulting thermo-spintronic responses are significantly enhanced at low temperatures by the emergence of Bogoliubov Fermi surface, and can be effectively controlled by tuning the latter. The effects render a probe of Bogoliubov Fermi surface and superconducting Berry curvatures supported by it. Our work reveals Berry curvature properties in topologically trivial proximity superconductors with spin-orbit coupling, and opens a new route to superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Tao Zhou, Zhao-Yang Dong, Zhao-Long Gu, Jian-Xin Li</p>
            <p>Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($>$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Equivalence of effective actions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin Falls</p>
            <p>For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamics of dilute anyon gases from fusion constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuto Nakajima, Umang Mehta, Hart Goldman</p>
            <p>Recent measurements on 2d materials tuning between fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases and a plethora of correlated electronic states call for a detailed understanding of the dynamics of anyons. Here we develop a general theory of the statistical mechanics of anyon gases at finite temperature, valid in regimes where the anyons are sufficiently dilute and can be treated as weakly interacting particles. We find that with a minimal set of universal braiding and fusion data, along with information about the hierarchy of anyon gaps, it is possible to construct a distribution function for any dilute anyon gas, as well as derive thermodynamic observables. Our results are built on an anyon exclusion principle manifesting as a constraint on fusion outcomes of physical states. Our approach unifies and streamlines a range of results for itinerant anyon models, from solvable lattice Hamiltonians to large-N field theories.</p>

            <p>A new model of light-induced bacteria motion in an aqueous medium is proposed. The model concerns bacteria both with and without flagellae. It is based on the hydrodynamics of active matter and allows for the changes of polarization of both bacteria and the medium. Natural light is assumed to intensify the motion of clusters with different refraction indices within the bacteria and to modify their polarization. Such motion of polarized globules causes an increase in deformations and inhomogeneous polarization distribution on the bacteria surfaces. The free energy functional is used to calculate the perturbation of the bacteria surfaces and inhomogeneous polarization distributions that may either move along the bacteria or rotate. Mechanical interaction of surface deformations with water flows or interaction of the inhomogeneous polarization with free charges causes bacteria motion in the medium. Estimates of the bacteria motion velocity in the case of the proposed mechanism are made and it corresponded to experimentally observed values.</p>

            <p>This work explores erbium-doped calcium molybdate (CaMoO$_4$) thin films grown on silicon and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates, as a potential solid state system for C-band (utilizing the $\sim$1.5 $\mu$m Er$^{3+}$ 4f-4f transition) quantum emitters for quantum network applications. Through molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and reflection electron diffraction studies, we identify an incorporation limited deposition regime that enables a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio in the growing film leading to single phase CaMoO$_4$ formation that can be in-situ doped with Er (typically 2-100 ppm). We further show that growth on silicon substrates is single phase but polycrystalline in morphology; while growth on YSZ substrates leads to high-quality epitaxial single crystalline CaMoO$_4$ films. We perform preliminary optical and microwave characterization on the suspected $Y_1 - Z_1$ transition of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial CaMoO$_4$ annealed thin films and extract an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited homogeneous linewidth of 6.7(4) MHz, and an EPR linewidth of 1.10(2) GHz.</p>

            <p>While Andreev bound states (ABSs) have been realized in engineered superconducting junctions, their direct observation in normal metal/superconductor heterostructures-enabled by quantum confinement-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the detection of ABSs in ultrathin metallic islands (Bi, Ag, and SnTe) grown on the s-wave superconductor NbN. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we clearly reveal in-gap ABSs with energies symmetric about the Fermi level. While the energies of these states show no position dependence, their wave functions exhibit spatial oscillations, demonstrating a quantum size effect. Both the energy levels and spatial distribution of the ABSs can be reproduced by our effective model in which a metallic island is coupled to the superconducting substrate via the proximity effect. We demonstrate that the coupling strength plays a critical role in determining the ABS energies. Our work introduces a novel physical platform for implementing ABSs, which hold promise for significant device applications.</p>

            <p>Rectification of electromagnetic fields into direct current (DC) is pivotal for energy harvesting, wireless charging, and next-generation communication technologies. The superconducting diode effect, which exploits the nonreciprocal transport of dissipationless superconducting currents, offers ultra-low power consumption and high rectification ratios. Combining the superconducting diode effect with the AC Josephson effect holds promise for converting radio-frequency (rf) irradiation into a quantized DC output. However, experimental realization has been hindered by challenges in achieving the necessary symmetry breaking and fabricating high-performance Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate the quantum rectification in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, which hosts emergent Josephson effects and a zero-field Josephson diode. Under rf irradiation, a DC voltage emerges without applied bias, scaling linearly with frequency as V = hf/2e, where h is Planck's constant, f is the microwave frequency, and e is the electron charge. Furthermore, the rectified voltage exhibits quantized steps with increasing rf power, consistent with Shapiro step quantization. Our work establishes CsV3Sb5 as a versatile platform for wireless quantum power supplies and charging, and underscores the intertwined order parameters as a promising pathway for precise quantum matter control.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huimin Xie, Bo Fu, Huan-Wen Wang, Wenyu Shan, Shun-Qing Shen</p>
            <p>The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), conventionally associated with time-reversal symmetry breaking in ferromagnetic materials, has recently been observed in nonmagnetic topological materials, raising questions about its origin. We unravel the unconventional Hall response in the nonmagnetic Dirac material ZrTe5, known for its massive Dirac bands and unique electronic and transport properties. Using the Kubo-Streda formula within the Landau level framework, we explore the interplay of quantum effects induced by the magnetic field (B) and disorder across the semiclassical and quantum regimes. In the semiclassical regime, the Hall resistivity remains linear in the magnetic field, but the Hall coefficient will be renormalized by the quantum geometric effects and electron-hole coherence, especially at low carrier densities where the disorder scattering dominates. In quantum limit, the Hall conductivity exhibits an unsaturating 1/B scaling. As a result, the transverse conductivity dominates transport in the ultra-quantum limit, and the Hall resistivity crosses over from B to B^{-1} dependence as the system transitions from the semiclassical regime to the quantum limit. This work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the unconventional Hall effect in ZrTe5 and provides insights into the AHE in other nonmagnetic Dirac materials as well.</p>

            <p>MnBi2Te4 (MBT) is the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, combining a topologically protected surface metallic state and intrinsic magnetic order. A structural compatibility with the nonmagnetic Bi2Te4 (BT) parent compound gives a possibility to create MBT/BT heterostructures and manipulate their magnetic state in view of optimizing the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE). In this work an extensive NMR study, supported by the bulk magnetization measurements has been performed at 4.2 K on a self-organized single crystal MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te4)n heterostructure. 55Mn and 209Bi NMR signal have been recorded as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field up to 6T, covering a spin-flop transition from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) to the canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) configuration of the Mn layers. Structural defects were shown to contribute a small ferromagnetic component below the spin-flop field. Presence of the AFM-coupled Mn antisites has been evidenced and shown to induce an antiparallel magnetic moment on Bi atoms within the host Bi layer. Detection of the induced magnetic moment on bismuth which contributes a new ferromagnetic component is of utmost importance for understanding the magnetic interactions in the MBT/BT system. These findings have potentially important implications for engineering the QAH devices.</p>

            <p>To gain a deeper insight into the anomalous yield behavior of Ni3Al, it is essential to obtain temperature-dependent formation Gibbs energies of the relevant planar defects. Here, the Gibbs energy of the complex stacking fault (CSF) is evaluated using a recently proposed ab initio framework [Acta Materialia, 255 (2023) 118986], accounting for all thermal contributions - including anharmonicity and paramagnetism - up to the melting point. The CSF energy shows a moderate decrease from 300K to about 1200 K, followed by a stronger drop. We demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the individual thermal excitations. We also propose a way to analyze the origin of the significant anharmonic contribution to the CSF energy through atomic pair distributions at the CSF plane. With the newly available high-temperature CSF data, an increasing energy barrier for the cross-slip process in Ni3Al with increasing temperature is unveiled, necessitating the refinement of existing analytical models.</p>

            <p>Polarons are widespread in functional materials and are key to device performance in several technological applications. However, their effective impact on material behavior remains elusive, as condensed matter studies struggle to capture their intricate interplay with atomic defects in the crystal. In this work, we present an automated workflow for modeling polarons within density functional theory (DFT). Our approach enables a fully automatic identification of the most favorable polaronic configurations in the system. Machine learning techniques accelerate predictions, allowing for an efficient exploration of the defect-polaron configuration space. We apply this methodology to Nb-doped TiO$_2$(110) surfaces, providing new insights into the role of defects in surface reactivity. Using CO adsorbates as a probe, we find that Nb doping has minimal impact on reactivity, whereas oxygen vacancies contribute significantly depending on their local arrangement via the stabilization of polarons on the surface atomic layer. Our package streamlines the modeling of charge trapping and polaron localization with high efficiency, enabling systematic, large-scale investigations of polaronic effects across complex material systems.</p>

In this study, we report fundamental experimental evidence of the altermagnetic nature of hematite ($\alpha$-\ch{Fe2O3}), combining electrical transport with advanced XPEEM imaging with linear and circular dichroism contrast. Our measurements directly visualize the Néel vector's coupling to the crystal orientation, confirming hematite's altermagnetic order and its symmetry-driven transport behavior. Transport measurements reveal an anisotropic AHE with a pronounced crystal orientation dependence, including a sign inversion for specific Néel vector alignments. Supported by first-principles theoretical calculations, we explain how the interplay between collinear spin and crystal symmetry breaking drives the observed anomalous Hall effect. These findings establish hematite as an altermagnet, paving the way for experimental identification of altermagnetic materials and their integration into spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>The newly discovered family of non-magnetic Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) provides a unique platform for exploring the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order, superconductivity, non-trivial topology, and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Although characterizing the CDW phase is essential for understanding and modeling these exotic phenomena, its nature remains unresolved. In this work, we employ first-principles free-energy calculations, accounting for both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results uncover that the CDW ground state is formed by reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers in a triangular hexagonal pattern, featuring energetically degenerate different stacking orders. This accounts for the various out-of-plane modulations observed experimentally and supports the coexistence of multiple domains. The discovered symmetry-broken ground state is consistent with the absence of any electronic anisotropy in transport experiments. By combining anharmonic phonons with the calculation of electron-phonon matrix elements, we predict a superconducting critical temperature for the CDW phase in agreement with experiments, showing that superconductivity is phonon mediated. These findings not only resolve a long-standing structural puzzle, but also clarify the impact of the CDW in superconductivity, highlighting its fundamental importance in shaping the low-temperature quantum phase diagram of Kagome metals.</p>

This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Measuring interactions between charged microspheres carrying a variety of surface chemistries reveals that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. Furthermore, the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.</p>

Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha > d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative approach that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen suggested that the RGM should also work on this generality.

            <p>We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals.

            <p>One-body reduced density-matrix functional (1RDMF) theory has yielded promising results for small systems such as molecules, but has not addressed quantum phase transitions such as the Mott transition. Here we explicitly execute the constrained search within a variational ansatz to construct a 1RDMF for the multi-orbital Hubbard model with up to seven orbitals in the thermodynamic limit. The variational ansatz is the \mathcal{N}=3 ansatz of the variational discrete action theory (VDAT), which can be exactly evaluated in d=\infty. The resulting 1RDMF exactly encapsulates the \mathcal{N}=3 VDAT results, which accurately captures Mott and Hund physics. We find that non-analytic behavior emerges in our 1RDMF at fixed integer filling, which gives rise to the Mott transition. We explain this behavior by separating the constrained search into multiple stages, illustrating how a nonzero Hund exchange drives the continuous Mott transition to become first-order. Our approach creates a new path forward for constructing an accurate 1RDMF for strongly correlated electron materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Zheng, Shi-Liang Zhu, Z. D. Wang</p>
            <p>The many-body physics of higher-spin systems is expected to host qualitatively new matter phases, but realizing them requires the controllable multispin interactions that can be tuned independently for each spin component. Here we propose a scheme that meets this demand in ultracold Fermi gases. By engineering the atom-cavity coupling, we generate cavity-mediated effective interactions between arbitrary pseudo-spin states. Focusing on the simplest three-spin case, we obtain two independent scattering channels whose strengths and signs can be adjusted separately. The resulting Hamiltonian combines the on-site attraction with the off-site repulsion, and drives a continuous transition from the superfluid to the spin-density-wave phase. The coexistence region is reminiscent of a supersolid, yet the self-organized modulation appears in the spin space of a higher-spin representation, rather than in the density profile. The proposal is reliable to be implemented using the existing techniques of ultracold atoms. Therefore it offers a versatile platform for quantum simulation of higher-spin many-body physics.</p>

We discuss a natural realization of such physics in quantum Hall bilayers, where a finite density of excitons with fractional statistics is argued to give rise to `anyonic exciton superfluidity,' the charge-neutral analog of anyon superconductivity. In a balanced bilayer of two Laughlin $\nu = 1/3$ states, the minimal interlayer exciton carries anyonic exchange statistics. A finite density of these excitons is argued to yield an exciton superfluid stitched to a specific bulk topological order and edge spectrum. Such superfluidity should be most robust near the direct transition into the Halperin $(112)$ state, and near analogous transitions in the bilayer Jain sequence at total filling $\nu_\text{T} = 2\times \frac{n}{2n+1}$. These topological transitions can be described by Chern-Simons QED$_3$, from which we derive several novel and general properties of anyon superfluidity near such transitions, including an anomalously large superfluid stiffness of $\kappa_\text{s} \propto |\delta\nu|^{1/2}$ at layer imbalance fraction $\delta\nu$. A notable feature of the phase diagrams we construct is the prevalence of spatial symmetry breaking, driven by an underlying composite Fermi surface. Our results can be directly tested with currently available experimental techniques. We compare our theory with existing data and make concrete predictions for future measurements, including higher-pseudospin exciton superfluids when doping higher Jain fractions.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small $c$-axis parameter of 3.26 Å and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. These results establish a clear correlation between decreasing $c$-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems. In addition, angle-dependent magnetoresistance investigations reveal the existence of a hybrid mixture of 2D and 3D superconductivity in this novel system with enhanced coupling between the rare-earth 5d and Ni 3d orbitals, confirmed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments. As the concentration of Eu increases, the system exhibits a clear tendency towards 3D superconductivity. Furthermore, we observe distinctive negative magnetoresistance in the europium-containing samples. These findings advocate clear materials design principles for higher transition temperatures and exotic physics in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izaak Neri</p>
            <p>Systems that are driven by a randomly timed, external protocol can seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. We show that this thermodynamic paradox is resolved if the outcome of the random time is stored in a memory device. Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss experimentally implementable setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hantao Zhang, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takami Tohyama, Hidetoshi Fukuyama</p>
            <p>A microscopic mechanism is proposed for a dramatic sign change of the Seebeck coefficient from positive to negative sign by the introduction of antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl based on bipolar random Anderson model (BPRAM), which incorporates hybridization effects between randomly distributed antisites and host bands, where the valence and conduction bands are treated separately due to their separation in momentum space. Applying a self-consistent T-matrix approximation, we find that antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl induce new states in the band overlap region, resulting in a scattering rate that is higher for hole carriers in the valence band than that for electron carriers in the conduction band, leading to negative Seebeck coefficient. This mechanism of sign change presents a potential new approach for controlling thermoelectric properties in semimetallic systems without changing carrier concentration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartik Panda, Itzik Kapon, Dumitru Dumcenco, Dirk van der Marel, Alexey Kuzmenko, Nimrod Bachar</p>
            <p>We combine polarized infrared magneto-transmission and Faraday angle rotation measurements to map the collective excitations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS$_3$. Below the Néel temperature ($T_\mathrm{N} \approx 118$ K), the phonon spectrum becomes strongly anisotropic, while a prominent excitation at 122 cm$^{-1}$ (15 meV) hardens on cooling and splits linearly with magnetic field,identifying its magnetic origin. From absolute transmission and Faraday angle measurements, we reconstruct the circular optical conductivities, revealing a pronounced dichroism of the field-split excitations. The upper branch near 129 cm$^{-1}$ shows an anomalously reduced dichroism, consistent with spin-phonon hybridization with a nearby infrared phonon. Several phonons exhibit sizable Faraday rotation, and Raman-active modes appear in the infrared spectra. Together with a broad mid-infrared band near 900 cm$^{-1}$ emerging only below $T_\mathrm{N}$, these observations point to inversion-symmetry breaking in the magnetic state. A weak Faraday feature near 320 cm$^{-1}$ ($\sim 40$ meV) further supports the presence of a higher-energy magnetic excitation. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom in FePS$_3$ and establish its relevance for exploring spin-lattice interactions in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihao Hu, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes of PbTiO$_3$, suggesting a potential route to enhanced electromechanical responses [\href{this https URL}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we identify a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which gives rise to an electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. The resulting structure, which can be canceptualized as a "self-Moiré" crystal, exhibits two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the long-period potential reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to a multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a physical route to designing complex chiral order that supports both giant electromechanical coupling and multi-valley electronics.</p>

            <p>Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new porous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated, closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally, we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.</p>

            <h2>When Does a Single Repulsive Dirac Cone Superconduct?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omid Tavakol, Thomas Scaffidi</p>
            <p>Superconductivity in a single two-dimensional Dirac cone offers a natural route to topological superconductivity. While usually considered extrinsic -- arising from proximity to a conventional superconductor -- we investigate when a doped Dirac cone can spontaneously develop superconductivity from a short-range repulsive interaction $U$ via the Kohn--Luttinger mechanism. We show that an ideal, linear Dirac cone is immune to pairing at leading order in $U^2$. Superconductivity instead emerges only through higher-order in $k$ corrections to the dispersion, which are unavoidable in any lattice realization and crucially dictate the pairing symmetry. The form of the pairing thus reflects how the well-known obstruction to realizing a single Dirac cone on a lattice is circumvented. When a Dirac cone arises from broken time-reversal symmetry -- for instance, at a transition between Chern insulators or in a valley-polarized phase -- we find a topological $p - ip$ state whose chirality is opposite to that of the parent chiral metal above $T_c$. By contrast, for a surface Dirac cone of a 3D topological insulator, superconductivity is stabilized by anisotropies in the dispersion. For $C_{3v}$-symmetric warping, as in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}$, pairing is strongest when the Fermi surface becomes hexagonal, leading to order in the $(d \pm id)\times(p+ip)$ channel with accidental near-nodes. In the highly anisotropic limit $v_x \gg v_y$, relevant to side surfaces of layered materials, the Fermi surface splits into two branches, and nesting favors a pairing symmetry $\Delta \sim \mathrm{sgn}(k_x)\cos(k_y)$ reminiscent of organic superconductors.</p>

            <p>With the rapid advancement of photovoltaic science, there has been an increasing focus on the development of environment-friendly and structurally advanced perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this context, this study investigates an architectural configuration employing 2D Dion-Jacobson phase perovskites as both electron and hole transport layers within a 2D/absorber/2D structure. The primary objective is to identify optimal absorber materials and enhance the overall efficiency of the device. While the reduction of lead content remains a significant challenge in PSC development, the present work focuses on the evaluation of seven lead-free absorber materials: MASnBr3, Sr3PI3/Sr3SbI3, p-CuBi2O4, p-Si, CH3NH3SnI3, Sb2Se3, and CZTSSe. These materials were assessed in the context of an FTO/PeDAMA8Pb6I19/IDL1/absorber/IDL2/PeDAMA2Pb3I10/C architecture utilizing SCAPS-1D simulation software. The study includes a comprehensive analysis of band alignment, pre-optimization screening, and performance optimization through the adjustment of absorber thickness, doping levels, and defect densities. Additionally, the temperature sensitivity and the substitution of the FTO layer with ITO, IZO, and MZO were also investigated. The simulation results indicated that Sb2Se3 and CZTSSe achieved the highest efficiencies of 41.00% and 41.19%, respectively. Furthermore, MZO was identified as a strong candidate for replacing FTO, maintaining consistent performance across all absorber types analyzed. Overall, this study provides a comparative framework for the material selection within layered PSC architectures and significantly contributes to the advancement of stable, efficient, and lead-free photovoltaic technologies.</p>

            <p>The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a complex interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. In this study, we use ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy to probe the evolution of CDW order in hole-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ across a broad range of compositions ($0 \leq x \leq 0.68$). While thermodynamic and diffraction measurements show long-range CDW order vanishes above $x \approx 0.05$, we observe persistent signatures of CDW fluctuations up to the highest doping levels, with correlation times on the order of several picoseconds. These results indicate the presence of robust fluctuating charge order that survives well beyond the established CDW phase boundary. Furthermore, these fluctuations are enhanced near a doping-tuned quantum phase transition at $x^* \approx 0.15$, which coincides with a local minimum in the superconducting $T_\mathrm{c}$ double-dome. Additional measurements on Ti- and K-substituted samples confirm that this behavior is intrinsic to hole doping and not tied to disorder. Overall, our findings suggest that CDW fluctuations play a central role in the electronic phase diagram of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and may mediate or compete with superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moiré systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moiré potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moiré potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moiré potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moiré systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.</p>

            <p>Atoms coupled to optical cavities provide a novel platform for understanding high-orbital exotic phenomena in strongly correlated materials. In this study, we investigate strongly correlated ultracold bosonic gases that are coupled to two orthogonally arranged optical cavities and driven by a blue-detuned running-wave laser field. Our results demonstrate that atoms initially in the $s$-orbital state can be scattered into $p_x$- and $p_y$-orbital states in either a symmetric or asymmetric manner, depending on the frequencies of the two cavities. For the symmetric configuration, we observe that atoms are scattered into the $p_x$- and $p_y$-orbitals equally. In the asymmetric case, photons emitted into one cavity mode suppress the scattering into the orthogonal mode. Notably, the coupling of atoms with multiple cavity modes leads to the emergence of high-orbital self-organized phases, accompanied by orbital-density waves that break different symmetries.</p>

            <p>Superconducting systems exhibit non-reciprocal current transport under certain conditions of symmetry breaking, a phenomenon known as the superconducting diode effect. This effect allows for perfect rectification of supercurrent, and has received considerable research interest. We report the observation of the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in nanowire-based Andreev molecules, where the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a Josephson junction (JJ) can be nonlocally broken by coherently coupling to another JJ. The JDE can be controlled using both non-local phase and gate voltages. Notably, the non-local phase can induce a sign reversal of the diode efficiency, a manifestation of regulating the probabilities of double elastic cotunneling and double-crossed Andreev reflection. Additionally, the diode efficiency can be further modulated by local and non-local gate voltages, exhibiting a central-peak feature in the gate-voltage space. Our theoretical calculations of the energy spectrum and the Josephson currents align well with the experimental results. These results demonstrate the non-local regulation of the JDE in Andreev molecules, offering significant implications for the control of multi-JJ devices and the development of advanced superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>The low-temperature electronic and magnetic properties of NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$, an isoelectronic analog of the spin-ladder compound $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$, are investigated using DFT+$U$ calculations. Two charge-ordering patterns - zigzag and linear chains of V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ ions - are considered. The zigzag configuration is found to be energetically preferred and exhibits insulating behavior with a band gap of 1.7 eV. In this state, magnetic V$^{4+}$ (d$^1$) ions form antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Calculated exchange interactions reveal strong diagonal (intrarung) and interladder couplings, indicating a complex spin-ladder network. These results suggest that NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$ retains essential spin-ladder characteristics while displaying new structural and magnetic features arising from the larger size and non-spherical geometry of the NH$_4^+$ ion compared to Na$^+$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankita Phutela, Saswata Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>Achieving external control over the anomalous valley Hall (AVH) effect is essential for advancing valleytronic applications. However, many of the existing approaches suffer from limitations such as irreversibility or volatility. In this work, we propose a general strategy for enabling nonvolatile electrical tuning of the AVH effect by utilizing multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that a heterostructure composed of a ferromagnetic monolayer VSSe and a ferroelectric monolayer Al$_2$S$_3$ permits fine control of valley transport properties. The AVH response in VSSe can be reversibly and nonvolatility switched by reversing the polarization of Al$_2$S$_3$ via an applied electric field. This ferroelectric mechanism ensures a stable valley state even without continuous energy input. Furthermore, the valley polarization can also be inverted through the same polarization switching process, providing a dual degree of control over valley-dependent phenomena. These findings establish a promising pathway toward intrinsically switchable and energy-efficient valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as WSe$_2$, are direct gap, multi-valley semiconductors. Long-range electron-hole exchange interactions mix the valleys, yielding dispersion relations for massive ($\propto Q^2$) as well as light-like ($\propto Q$) excitons. We report magneto-photoluminescence spectroscopy of excitons in the monolayer semiconductor WSe$_2$ to $B = \pm25$T. The magnetic field-dependent line shape of the neutral exciton reveals the emergence of a new blue-detuned emission peak in both field orientations. Analyzing the distinct magnetic field-dependent shifts of both peaks facilitates the identification of the emergent feature as a spin-singlet with a significantly smaller reduced exciton mass as compared to the neutral exciton. The intensity of the emergent feature increases with magnetic field according to $\propto B^2$, as expected for a linear dispersion relation. The density-dependent diamagnetic shift ratios of both features follow the expected density dependence of the electron-hole exchange interactions. We interpret our observations within a picture of magnetic-field-induced coupling between the bright massive and quasi dark light-like exciton, leading to its brightening.</p>

For plasmonic systems with characteristic size below the diffraction limit, we obtain an explicit expression for optical polarizability that describes the lineshape of optical spectra solely in terms of the metal dielectric function and LSP frequency. The amplitude of the LSP spectral band is determined by the effective system volume that, for long-wavelength LSPs, can significantly exceed the physical volume of metal nanostructure. Within the quasistatic approach, we derive the exact LSP Green's function and establish general spectral properties of LSPs, including the distribution and oscillator strength of the LSP states. These results can be used to model or interpret the experimental spectra of plasmonic nanostructures and to tune their optical properties for various applications.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Zhan, Congcong Le, Xianxin Wu, Jiangping Hu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has generated significant interest in uncovering the underlying pairing mechanisms and correlated electronic states. While earlier theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of nonlocal Coulomb interactions, in the presence of onsite interactions, on both superconducting and density-wave instabilities using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach. We find that the interlayer intraorbital repulsion suppresses the interlayer intraorbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave (SDW) order, while promoting a transition to an interlayer interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state and a mirror-symmetry-breaking charge order. Remarkably, the critical scale of the interorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the intraorbital $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, indicating that the former is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Moreover, the interlayer interorbital repulsion suppresses this $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing but enhances the $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing through strengthened interlayer charge fluctuations. In addition, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion favors an in-plane charge-density-wave (CDW) order with wave vector $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings reveal the profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and underscore the robustness of interlayer pairing rooted in the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, thereby advancing the understanding of the intricate correlation effects in bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <h2>Light-induced ultrafast magnetization dynamics in van der Waals antiferromagnetic CrSBr</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Kefayati, Yafei Ren</p>
            <p>We investigate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of semiconducting antiferromagnetic CrSBr using real-time time-dependent density functional theory. In zero magnetic field, laser excitation modifies only the magnetization along the easy axis, leaving transverse components unaffected. We find that below-gap, low-fluence pulses enhance the local magnetic moments via spin transfer from nonmagnetic to magnetic atoms, increasing the Neel vector. In contrast, high-fluence pulses drive interlayer spin transfer between magnetic atoms, producing strong demagnetization and reducing the Neel vector, while S and Br atoms exhibit primarily charge transfer with weak opposite contribution to the demagnetization. An applied magnetic field qualitatively alters the response, enabling both magnitude changes and ultrafast reorientation of the magnetization. We show that the resulting layer-resolved reorientation respects a twofold rotation about the x-axis, exciting coherent optical magnons even under this symmetry, which modulate the relative angle between neighboring layers and periodically tune electronic properties. These results reveal a microscopic pathway for coherent magnon excitation in van der Waals magnets and establish a framework for controlling their coupled spin-charge dynamics on femtosecond timescales.</p>

            <h2>Chern-Simons-matter conformal field theory on fuzzy sphere: Confinement transition of Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Zhou, Chong Wang, Yin-Chen He</p>
            <p>Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.</p>

            <h2>Deterministic Mechanical Wigner Negativity via Nonlinear Cavity Quantum Optomechanics in the Unresolved-Sideband Regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack Clarke, Pascal Neveu, Ewold Verhagen, Michael R. Vanner</p>
            <p>Non-Gaussian quantum states of mechanical motion exhibiting Wigner negativity offer promising capabilities for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Within the field of cavity quantum optomechanics, deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states with such Wigner negativity is a highly sought goal but is challenging as the intracavity interaction Hamiltonian is linear in mechanical position. Here, we show that, despite this form of interaction, by utilizing the nonlinearity of the cavity response with mechanical position, mechanical Wigner negativity can be prepared deterministically in the unresolved-sideband regime, without additional nonlinearities, nonclassical drives, or conditional measurements. In particular, we find that Wigner negativity can be prepared with an optical pulse, even without single-photon strong coupling, and the negativity persists in the steady state of a continuously driven system. Our results deepen our understanding of cavity-enhanced radiation pressure and establish a pathway for deterministic preparation of nonclassical mechanical states in the unresolved sideband regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiki Fukusumi, Shinichiro Yahagi</p>
            <p>We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk (or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional methods in abstract algebra and modular form.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shun Chi, Carolina A. Marques, Walter N. Hardy, Ruixing Liang, Pinder Dosanjh, Doug A. Bonn, Sarah A. Burke, Peter Wahl</p>
            <p>Quasi-particle interference (QPI) is a powerful tool to characterize the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in unconventional superconductors, by mapping the spatial dependence of elastic tunneling of electrons between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope and a sample. Here, we consider the influence of inelastic tunneling on quasi-particle interference, exemplarily for the iron-based superconductor LiFeAs. We clearly observe replica features in both experimental QPI maps and the dispersion extracted from QPI, which from comparison with theoretical model calculations can be attributed to inelastic tunneling. Analysis of the QPI dispersion shows that the inelastic mode that gives rise to these replica features exhibits a resonance between 8 and 10 meV. Comparison of the energy scale of the resonance energy estimated from QPI with inelastic neutron scattering indicates that the replica features arise from interaction with spin fluctuations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anders Enevold Dahl, Andrea Maiani, Max Geier, Javad Shabani, Karsten Flensberg</p>
            <p>Andreev bound states are superpositions of electrons and holes in a metal that form by coherent reflection from a superconductor. When the length of the superconductor is comparable to the superconducting coherence length, Andreev bound states at opposite edges hybridize by quasiparticle tunneling. In a periodic array, these hybridized bound states form a band at energies below the superconducting gap. In this paper, we derive a theoretical framework for the transport properties of these Andreev crystals. We demonstrate that at high interface transparency and constant phase bias between neighboring superconductors, these bands are {\it directional}: one band consists only of right -- while the other only of left-moving electronic states. This property enables the application of this device as a flux- and bias-voltage tunable filter that permits signal transmission in only one direction.</p>

            <h2>Electro-thermal Co-design of High-power Vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky Diodes with High-permittivity Dielectric Field-plate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahsanul Mohaimeen Audri, Chung-Ping Ho, Jingjing Shi, Esmat Farzana</p>
            <p>This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Magnetic Field on Neutral Bath Containing Charged Brownian Particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jana Tothova, Jan Busa, Vladimir Lisy</p>
            <p>Based on the Zwanzig-Caldeira-Legget theory generalized to systems under the influence of a static magnetic field, we obtain equations of motion for the Brownian particle (BP) and oscillators constituting the bath in which the BP is embedded. The equations are of the type of a generalized Langevin equation, which accounts for the frictional memory of the system. The BP is assumed to be charged while the bath particles are neutral. They thus do not directly respond to the external field, but their interaction with the BP leads to changes in the bath state. Using the solution of the equations found, we calculate the average bath angular momentum and show that it persists for long times when the system is assumed to reach equilibrium. This indicates a possible violation of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem for baths consisting of charged particles. However, this must be confirmed by a substantial generalization of the presented model when the bath particles feel the external field, which affects the memory in the dynamics of the system.</p>

The formalism is applied to reformulate the creation and annihilation operators, leading to modified expressions for the fundamental thermodynamic quantities while preserving the underlying Fermi Dirac statistics. We derived modified expressions for the main thermodynamic quantities. In both the non degenerate and degenerate limits, we examined the effects of the Dunkl parameter on the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and heat capacity. Furthermore, we analyzed how the Dunkl deformation influences the isothermal compressibility, the average velocity of particles, and the Pauli paramagnetism.</p>

            <h2>Control of magnetic transition, metal-semiconductor transition, and magnetic anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric monolayer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui-Qi Wang, Tengfei Cao, Tian-Min Lei, Xie Zhang, Yue-Wen Fang</p>
            <p>Recent advances in two-dimensional materials have greatly expanded the family of ferromagnetic materials. The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI$_3$, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayers, are characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here we report a Janus ferromagnet, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$ with inversion symmetry breaking, through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal-semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te$_3$ atoms play a key role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from $p_z / p_y$ and $p_x / p_y$ orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by strain or electric field.</p>

            <p>Half-semimetals, characterized by their spin-polarized electronic states, hold significant promise for spintronic applications but remain scarce due to stringent electronic and magnetic criteria. Through a combination of transport measurements and optical spectroscopy, we investigated the intermetallic compound Mn4Al11, which features an exceptionally low carrier concentration and undergoes a magnetic phase transition near 68 K. Transport measurements reveal anomalies that deviate from typical metallic behavior at low temperatures. Optical spectroscopy indicates a small, nearly frequency-independent optical conductivity in the far-infrared region, with spectral weight decreasing as the temperature drops from 300 K to 50 K. These behaviors suggest a temperaturedependent carrier density and significant scattering of charge carriers. Combining experimental findings with calculated electronic band structures, we propose that Mn4Al11 is a novel half-semimetal candidate exhibiting a ferrimagnetic ground state.</p>

            <p>The motion of suspended colloidal particles generates fluid disturbances in the surrounding medium that create interparticle interactions. While such colloidal hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) have been extensively studied in viscous Newtonian media, comprehensive understanding of HIs in viscoelastic fluids is lacking. We develop a framework to quantify HIs in viscoelastic fluids with high spatiotemporal precision by trapping colloids and inducing translation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling. Using solutions of wormlike micelles (WLMs) as a case study, we discover that HIs are strongly time-dependent and depend on the structural memory generated in the viscoelastic fluid, in contrast to "instantaneous" HIs in viscous Newtonian fluids. We directly measure time-dependent HIs between a stationary probe and a driven particle during transient start-up, developing on the WLM relaxation timescale. Following the sudden cessation of the driven particle, we observe an intriguing flow reversal in the opposing direction, lasting for a time about ten times larger than the WLM relaxation time. We corroborate our observations with analytical microhydrodynamic theory, direct numerical solutions of a continuum model, and particle-based Stokesian dynamics simulations. We find that the structural recovery of the WLMs from a nonlinear strain can generate anisotropic and heterogeneous stresses that produce flow reversals and hydrodynamic attraction among colloids. Measured heterogeneities indicate a breakdown of standard continuum models for constitutive relations when the size of colloids is comparable to the length scales of the polymeric constituents and their entanglement lengths.</p>

            <p>Understanding crack tip - dislocation interaction is critical for improving the fracture resistance of semi-brittle materials like room-temperature plastically deformable ceramics. Here, we use a modified double cleavage drilled compression (DCDC) specimen geometry, which facilitates stable crack propagation, to achieve in situ observation of crack tip - dislocation interaction. MgO specimens, furnished with dislocation-rich barriers, were employed to study how dislocations influence crack propagation. Crack progression was clearly observed to decelerate within dislocation-rich regions, slowing to 15% of its velocity as compared to the pristine crystal. Upon exiting these regions, cracks reaccelerated until reaching the next dislocation-rich barrier. Coupled phase field and crystal plasticity modeling replicates the experimental observations and provides mechanistic insight into crack tip - dislocation interactions. The aligned experiment and simulation results underscore the robustness of the technique and its potential to inform the design of more fracture-resistant ceramics via dislocations.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the influence of off-diagonal dipolar interactions in the mixed-anisotropy magnet $LiHo_{x}Er_{1-x}F_4$. Motivated by experimental observations showing an unexpectedly rapid suppression of the ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_c$ upon substitution of Ho by Er ions, we use Monte Carlo simulations incorporating off-diagonal dipolar terms to elucidate the underlying physical mechanism. Our results reveal that, unlike in the diluted magnet $LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_4$, where dilution weakens the effect of these interactions, substitution by planar Er ions amplifies it. This leads to a pronounced reduction of $T_c$, closely matching experimental data, thereby resolving discrepancies with mean-field predictions. The findings underscore the essential role of off-diagonal dipolar interactions in determining the magnetic properties of mixed-anisotropy dipolar systems.</p>

            <p>Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast, low-power memory devices. While previous studies have attributed polarization switching to full-layer sliding, the symmetry constraints pose fundamental limitations. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls within in-plane polarization break C3 symmetry, enabling polarization switching under out-of-plane electric fields. Local polarization vectors deviate to response to the field, leading to local reconstruction, and ultimately drives the migration of domain walls. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, successfully realized by our experiments. These insights clarify the microscopic switching mechanism in hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, providing a basis for future nanoelectronics applications.</p>

After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart.</p>

A simplified topological characterization of HRTIs with generalized boundary conditions is carried out based on the existence of edge-state bands in the infinite HRTI and the restrictions imposed by the boundary conditions. Edge states in finite or semi-infinite 1D HRTIs are shown to be a subset of evanescent states of the infinite system and mapped onto impurity states of the uniform chain with effective energy-dependent edge potentials. The latter result allows the determination of the edge state levels without needing the diagonalization of real space or bulk Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Tayyab, Jahanzeb Tariq</p>
            <p>We consider deterministic dynamics, known as the slicer map (SM), which exhibits normal and anomalous diffusion by varying a single parameter. The statistics of the position moments and the low-order position autocorrelation function (PACF) of the SM closely overlap with those of a stochastic process called the Lévy-Lorentz gas (LLg), particularly in the normal and strongly superdiffusive anomalous regimes. However, matching low-order statistics alone cannot fully characterize the microscopic dynamics or distinguish underlying process classes. To demonstrate how these dynamics strongly overlap, we focus on the scaling of higher-order PACF, which provides a more detailed characterization. In this paper, we analytically derive the generalized PACF of the SM and explore its scaling forms under different temporal relationships. Specifically, we derive several scalings of the 3-point PACF by analyzing intriguing relations between three times. We compare these scalings with the power-law tails of the numerically estimated 3-point PACF of the LLg. This comparison provides a detailed description of the correlation scalings of the SM, demonstrating that the SM shares key features with the LLg. Our findings establish the SM as a deterministic analog of the LLg, enabling efficient prediction of multi-time position correlations in superdiffusive systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Bestler, Oded Zilberberg</p>
            <p>Thouless pumping is a paradigmatic example of topologically protected, directed transport in linear systems. Recent extensions to nonlinear pumps often overlook the need to reassess the conventional framework of linear topology. In this work, we study a nonlinear dimer-chain model that exhibits quantized transport of kinks under a periodic modulation of a pumping parameter. Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model and display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods from nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are the driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport resembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by conventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a topological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally nonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we demonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton motion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify concepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework for quantized transport in nonlinear media.</p>

            <p>Ovonic threshold switching is the key process for several applications of chalcogenide alloys including phase change memories and selector elements in cross-points arrays. Very recently, it has been shown that the threshold switching voltage VT depends on the polarity of the applied field. This feature has been already exploited in the realization of the Single Chalcogenide X-point Memory (SXM) in which a single film of a chalcogenide alloy can serve as both a memory and selector unit. In this work, we provide a microscopic understanding of the polarity-dependent VT by leveraging electrical and physical measurements, numerical simulations based on technology computer aided design (TCAD) and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We developed a Graded Band Gap (GBG) model in which an inhomogeneous distribution of localized electronic states in the gap is established by the opposite effect of a strong electric field at the cathode and a high density of electrons in the conduction band at the anode. The model is suitable to reproduce several features of the programming window, including its dependence on temperature, thickness and composition of the chalcogenide alloy. The microscopic understanding that we gained on the SXM operation lays the foundation for important improvements in the memory design and in the selection of better performing alloys for applications in enabling memory technologies.</p>

            <p>Optical imaging plays an instrumental role in understanding the behavior of trapped neutral atoms. In this work, we describe a deep learning-based online image completion protocol that reduces interference fringes in optical absorption signals for a dual-species atomic system. Regardless of the distinct nature of the task for two different atomic species, 6Li and 23Na, the method displays a robust solution for suppressing fringes. To incorporate this into daily operations, a transfer learning scheme is required that incrementally updates the previously learned parameters. We outline an online image completion method that efficiently adapts to drifting experimental conditions. Our method can be easily integrated into lab settings, where transfer learning can accelerate image analysis.</p>

            <p>Time- and Angle-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy is employed to monitor photoexcited electrons in the two-dimensional (BA)$_2$(MA)$_2$Pb$_3$I$_{10}$. ARPES intensity maps are in good agreement with ab-initio calculations of the band structure. The effective mass is $-0.18 \pm 0.02 m_e$ and $0.12 \pm 0.02 m_e$ for holes and electrons, respectively. In the photoexcited state, spin-orbit splitting of the conduction band cannot be resolved. This sets the upper bound of photoinduced Rashba coupling to $\alpha_C<2.5$ eVÅ. The correlated electron-hole plasma evolves in Wannier excitons with Bohr radius of 2.5 nm, while no sign of self-trapping in small polarons is found within the investigated time window of up to 120 ps following photoexcitation.</p>

            <h2>Comparative study of magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO from first principles</h2>

            <p>Spin-wave excitations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials and hold promise for future information and communication technologies. Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT) with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy differences using the four-state mapping ($\Delta E$), and the other via the magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the Heisenberg model based on $\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and design of magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enable high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges.</p>

            <h2>Steering chiral active Brownian motion via stochastic position-orientation resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Shee</p>
            <p>Guiding active motion is important for targeted delivery, sensing, and search tasks. Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical, physical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport efficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome these limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by interrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are infrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared displacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state excess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state diagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two resetting-dominated states with and without chirality; in contrast, the achiral counterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state. Chirality thus enriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between transport modes absent in achiral systems. A simple reset protocol can thus transform chiral active dynamics and offer a practical strategy for optimizing search and transport in circle swimmers.</p>

            <p>Understanding nonequilibrium electron-phonon interactions at the microscopic level and on ultrafast timescales is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. The present study advances our understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over relaxation pathways in driven solids.</p>

            <h2>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enhanced by Synergetic Interactions among Photon Phonon and Molecule</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Sun, Yimin Xuan</p>
            <p>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling.</p>

            <h2>Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing-Sui Lu</p>
            <p>We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.</p>

            <p>An angular-dependent potential for the U-Nb system is developed based on an existing ADP for U and a new EAM potential for Nb through fitting flexible cross-interaction functions and alloy parameters to experimental and first-principles data, enabling accurate prediction of phase transitions (alpha to gamma driven by solute concentration; alpha-prime to gamma under temperature in U-6Nb alloy), elastic properties, defect energetics, and mixed enthalpy. The potential reliably reproduces melting points of U-Nb solid solutions and captures lattice parameter expansion of gamma U-6Nb. Notably, it correctly predicts Hugoniot relations and equations of state up to about 90 GPa and resolves the alpha-prime to gamma transition under static high pressure. Combined with atomic simulations, we reveal a twinning-coupled alpha-prime to gamma transition of U-6Nb under high pressures: {112}gamma twins form via nanosecond-scale twinning precursors generated during the transient adiabatic compressions. The static phase transition pressure is predicted to be 54.5 GPa, comparable to 67.2 GPa by first-principles calculations. Besides, our result suggests that U-6Nb single-crystal would experience a nonlinear elastic relaxation before yielding plastically at 3.1 GPa (shear stress: 0.9 GPa). The results in this work help resolve long-standing discrepancies in understanding the abnormal shear stress relaxation mechanisms under high-pressure shock loading.</p>

            <p>We identify topological dissipation -- momentum transport along the polymer backbone with Ising-type exponential decay ($\sim \exp(-\Delta n/n_\text{d})$) -- as the missing link connecting atomistic and mesoscale dynamics. Simulations of four polymers reveal that dynamical correlation length $n_\text{d} \approx n_\text{k}/3$ (Kuhn length $n_\text{k}$), enabling a coarse-grained framework that \emph{explicitly separates} topological (intrachain) and spatial (interchain) dissipation channels without temporal memory kernels. The approach quantitatively reproduces dynamics from segmental relaxation to chain diffusion, solving the long-standing memory preservation challenge in Markovian coarse-graining. Our results establish topology-mediated dissipation as a key mechanism for polymer dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Chiral Superfluids with a Complex Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Hang Ji, Wenxing Nie</p>
            <p>Recently, the influence of dissipation on a quantum system has attracted much attention, particularly on how the non-Hermitian terms modify the energy spectrum, band topology, and phase transition point. Motivated by the recent investigation of non-Hermitian $s$-wave superfluidity, we study the non-Hermitian chiral $p+ip$ superfluid (SF) with a complex-valued interaction, originating from inelastic scattering between fermions. We reformulate the non-Hermitian mean-field theory for chiral SFs and derive the gap equation in the path integral approach. By numerically solving the gap equation, we obtain the phase diagram of the non-Hermitian $p+ip$ SF, characterized by the reentrant SF transition and dissipation-induced SF phase, as a result of the evolution of the exceptional lines. The method can be extended to higher partial-wave chiral SFs, such as $d+id$ and $f+if$-wave SFs. We further consider such a chiral $p+ip$ SF on a square lattice, to investigate the influence of dissipation on topology. We find that the non-Hermitian skin effect is absent in the specific cylinder geometry, in which the topology associated with the edge modes and Chern number is robust to dissipation. Besides, we find that the energies at the robust point nodes and line nodes are pure real. We further verify the conditions of zero winding number in (quasi-) one-dimensional systems, and prove an associated ``no-go'' theorem, which is hopefully applied to explore the geometry dependent skin effect.</p>

            <p>Chiral quantum magnets with spin-states separated by a large energy gap are technologically attractive but difficult to realize. Geometrically frustrated topological states with nanoscale chirality may offer a chemical pathway to such materials. However, room temperature spin misalignment, weakness of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and high energy requirements for lattice distortions set high physicochemical barriers for their realization. Here, we show that layered iron oxyhydroxides (LIOX) address these challenges due to chirality transfer from surface ligands into spin-states of dimerized FeO6 octahedra with zig-zag stacking. The intercalation of chiral amino acids induces angular displacements in the antiferromagnetic spin pairs with a helical coupling of magnetic moments along the screw axis of the zig-zag chains, or helical spin-ladders. Unlike other chiral magnets, the spin states in LIOX are chemically and optically accessible, they display strong optical resonances with helicity-matching photons and enable spin-selective charge transport. The static rather than dynamic polarization of spin ladders in LIOX makes them particularly suitable for catalysis. Room-temperature spin pairing, field-tunability, environmental robustness, and synthetic simplicity make LIOX and its intercalates a uniquely practical family of quantum magnets.</p>

            <p>An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.</p>

Using topological field theory we demonstrate that the phase is a topological charge-$4e$ superconductor with chiral central charge $c_-=4$. We further identify the deconfined excitations and anyonic excitations bound to the vortex. This unusual superconductor may be realized in moir'e bilayer and detected through quantized thermal Hall effect and spin quantum Hall effect.</p>

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows a nearly linear decrease in the high-temperature range, indicating the spin gapless semiconductor like behavior of the material. This SGS nature is further supported by the temperature-independent carrier concentration and mobility. Hall effect analysis reveals that the anomalous Hall effect in CoRuTiGe arises from both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Additionally, a well-defined symmetric negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures. These findings suggest that CoRuTiGe holds significant promise for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Itinerant antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal symmetry have recently attracted attention, since their spin-split bands enable large magnetotransport responses comparable to ferromagnets despite the negligible spontaneous magnetisation. When the inversion symmetry is further broken by the antiferromagnetic order, the emerging odd-parity multipole order renders the bands spin-degenerate but asymmetric in the momentum space. For such parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnets, it has been predicted that electronic nematicity is induced by current, allowing unconventional nonlinear transport phenomena. However, their experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we report nonreciprocal angular magnetoresistance in the layered Dirac material SrMnBi$_2$ with parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic order in its Mn-Bi layers. By quantitatively modelling the angular and field dependencies using a phenomenological framework, we reveal that the observed nonreciprocal interlayer resistivity arises from the broken four-fold symmetry of the Dirac valleys in the Bi square net adjacent to the Mn-Bi layer. Furthermore, we demonstrate the alignment of parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic domains via current-field cooling, achieving electric-magnetic control of the $f$-wave polarity in momentum space. The observed switchable nonreciprocal transport associated with current-induced valley symmetry breaking paves the way for novel antiferromagnetic spintronic and valleytronic applications.</p>

Unlike the spin polarization at the Fermi level, which follows the pseudospin, the proximity-induced magnetic moments vary across carbon atoms, defying analytical modeling. To address this, we develop a Random Forest model trained on DFT data and employ Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptors to map the local ($\sim 2\,$nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich magnetic moiré textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic environments and are beyond analytical description.</p>

            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy includes a reflection operation.. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction of the SPT phase with the aid of a controlled local defect. In this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. Based on the tri-junction implementation, we demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. We further propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.</p>

While their individual high-P/T phase diagrams have been mapped in considerable detail, comparatively little attention has been paid to the mixtures in which the two species can couple through oxygen transfer, charge redistribution, and nonadiabatic dissociation pathways. Here we use comprehensive ab initio adiabatic/nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, essentially a diabatic trajectory stitching approach, that chart the evolution of CO-N2O mixtures from van-der-Waals fluids to extended amorphous network solids over the range 0-160 GPa and 300-1500 K. We emphasize on (i) the sequence of gas to molecular crystal to polymerized amorphous solid reactive transitions that arise from an interplay between thermal and compression effects in metastable C-N-O mixtures, (ii) the role of N2O unimolecular dissociation in lowering the onset pressure for CO polymerization, and (iii) the emergence of nonadiabatic pathways, via thermal unimolecular dissociation of N2O, accompanied by spin-transition in oxygen atoms that can make C-N-O systems deviate from Born-Oppenheimer dynamics. This dominates the chemistry once the mixture enters the regime of bond-breaking temperatures (T>900 K).</p>

            <p>Achieving operating conditions comparable to ``bulk'' electronic devices, such as thin film capacitors, during \textit{operando} electron microscopy remains challenging, particularly when devices are grown on non-conductive substrates. Limited precision of focused ion beam milling for sample preparation often necessitates the use of conductive substrates or artificially thick layers that differ from actual device architectures. These modifications can alter native strain, electrostatic boundary conditions, and ultimately device response. Here, we present a generic and versatile workflow for \textit{operando} biasing of thin-film capacitors in the (scanning) transmission electron microscope, including sample fabrication and device operation. By introducing a patterned insulating barrier adjacent to the bulk-characterized capacitors, our approach enables sample preparation without altering the original film structure. As a case study, we apply the method to a piezoelectric thin-film capacitor grown on an insulating substrate, and demonstrate that it preserves the boundary-condition-sensitive domain switching at the atomic scale under applied electric fields. Overall, the process can help to establish a foundation for systematic \textit{operando} studies of complex thin-film systems under representative bulk testing geometries.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Deimetry, Timothy C. Petersen, Matthew Weyland, Scott D. Findlay</p>
            <p>In the elastic scattering regime, probe position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns have proven robust for estimating specimen thickness and mistilt. Through simulation, we show that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of a small concentration of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors.</p>

            <h2>Robust Topological Conduction in Bi2 Bi2Se3 Superlattices at Ambient Conditions</h2>

            <p>Topologically protected surface states have garnered significant attention due to their robustness against perturbations and potential applications in optoelectronics. Bi2 Bi2Se3 is a topological semimetal composed of a 2D bismuthene sheet and a Bi2Se3 quintuple layer, forming an intrinsic superlattice. This study investigates the electronic structure and edge states of Bi2 Bi2Se3 [001] oriented films under ambient conditions through conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). Point I-V spectroscopy and current imaging are used to characterize the surface and local transport properties of bismuthene and Bi2Se3 terminated layers. Our measurements reveal force dependent shifts in conduction mechanisms in both bismuthene and Bi2Se3, transitioning from direct tunneling (DT) at low forces and low biases, to Fowler Nordheim tunneling (FNT) at low forces and high biases, and eventually to a more ohmic like behavior at the highest forces. Under DT conditions on the bismuthene termination, we observed the Dirac cone in the dI/dV spectroscopy. Edge states are observed along the perimeter of the (001) terraces for both terminations, and are observed to have higher conductivity than the local terrace. Force-dependent imaging revealed an increase in the width of the edge state as force increased, until the conductive edge state appeared to cover the entire terrace. Furthermore, terrace heights display a force dependent distortion from the high tip forces, which indicates that the transition to the ohmic-like contact regime on either termination results from a complex interplay between strain and tip induced effects. All measurements were performed under ambient conditions, which demonstrates the robustness of the topological and edge states to ambient conditions.</p>

            <h2>Understanding high photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 high-pressure columbite phase by experiments and first-principles calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jimenez, Taner Akbay, Tatsumi Ishihara, Kaveh Edalati</p>
            <p>The clean production of hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel can be done using photocatalysis, with TiO2 being one of the most promising photocatalysts. However, the activity of TiO2 anatase and rutile phases is still limited. In this study, an oxygen-deficient high-pressure phase of TiO2, columbite, is stabilized by a high-pressure torsion method. The phase is utilized as an active photocatalyst for hydrogen production, and the mechanism of its high activity is examined using density functional theory (DFT). The activity of columbite appears to be experimentally higher than that of the anatase phase. DFT calculations revealed that columbite does not have a narrow electronic bandgap, but its optical bandgap and light absorbance are improved by oxygen vacancies more significantly compared to anatase. Moreover, the water adsorption energy is higher and the surface activation energy for water splitting on the (101) atomic plane of columbite is lower than that for the active planes of anatase. In conclusion, although columbite is not a low-bandgap semiconductor, its large light absorbance and high surface catalytic activity make it a promising candidate for photocatalytic reactions.</p>

            <p>An analytically solvable cell fluid model with unrestricted cell occupancy, infinite-range Curie-Weiss-type attraction and short-range intra-cell repulsion is studied within the grand-canonical ensemble. Building on an exact single-integral representation of the grand partition function, we apply Laplace's method to obtain asymptotically exact expressions for the pressure, density and equation of state. The model exhibits a hierarchy of first-order transitions, each terminating at a critical point. We determine the coordinates of the first five such points. Recasting the formalism in dimensionless variables highlights the explicit temperature dependence of all thermodynamic functions. This enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the entropy. The results reveal pronounced entropy minima around integer cell occupancies and reproduce density-anomaly isotherm crossings analogous to those in core-softened models.</p>

            <p>To realize the significant potential of optical materials such as strongly electron-correlated open-shell rare-earth monoxides, understanding the electron-localization Hubbard parameters ($U$) is of central importance. The Hubbard energy is believed to be material specific and constant. However, it has recently been pointed out that even subtle structural changes can induce changes in $U$ parameters. For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation. Given the typical detection sensitivity of differential spectroscopy ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-4}$), even a few meV modulations in $U$ are sufficient for a detectable spectral response.</p>

            <p>Cr-doped ZnO films were fabricated by a new but feasible method, that is, annealing Cr-Zn layers deposited via DC magnetron sputtering in air. Microstructures of the films were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, intrinsic point defects were identified via photoluminescence spectroscopy, and optical and dielectric properties were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and dielectric spectrometer, respectively. It was found that the average grain sizes decrease (56.34 - 39.50 nm), the band gap increases (from 3.18 to 3.23 eV), and the transmittance (at 600 nm) decreases (from 91% to 83%) with increasing Cr. Two activation energies of conduction increase after doping Cr, indicating enhanced temperature stability. At optimal Cr levels, ZnO films exhibit high transmittance and conductivity, exhibiting potential for transparent electrode development. This method can be extended to other doped ZnO films, such as Al-doped ZnO transparent electrodes, to achieve simultaneous improvements in transmittance, conductivity, and stability for flexible and wearable applications.</p>

            <p>The gapless chiral hinge states of three dimensional second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) support a quantized conductance plateau on thick nanowire. Here, we numerical study the conductance of SOTI constrictions. According to finite size effects, the hinge states in narrow region could be hybridized, which will induce reflection at the two ends of constrictions. The conductance exists the Fabry-Perot oscillation pattern because of multiple reflections. We also study the impact of the magnetic field on the Fabry-Perot interference. We show the dimensional effect that the magnetic field leads to the electrons being localized on two hinges. Our results are robust against moderate disorder so that we expect these Fabry-Perot patterns could be observed in experiments.</p>

            <p>The nonmagnetic kagome metal ScV6Sn6 displays an unconventional charge order (CO) accompanied by signatures of an anomalous Hall effect, hidden magnetism, and multiple lattice instabilities. In this study, we report the observation of unconventional anomalous thermoelectric properties. Notably, unexpected anomalous transverse Nernst signals reach a peak value of ~4 {\mu}V/K near the TCDW ~92 K in ScV6Sn6, and these signals persist in the charge-ordered state as the temperature decreases to 10 K. Furthermore, both thermopower and thermal conductivity exhibit significant changes under magnetic fields, even in the nonmagnetic ground state. These observations strongly suggest the emergence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in ScV6Sn6, as supported by muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements. While hidden magnetism represents the most plausible origin, alternative mechanisms involving orbital currents and chiral charge order remain possible.</p>

            <p>Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges have garnered increasing attention recently. Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably, the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Defects on Thermal Transport across Solid/Solid Heterogeneous Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ershuai Yin, Wenzhu Luo, Lei Wang, Qiang Li</p>
            <p>During the fabrication of heterogeneous structures inside chips, impurities and defects are inevitably introduced. However, the mechanism by which defects affect interfacial heat transport remains unclear. In this work, a microscale thermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects. The effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport characteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal conductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show that, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects weakens heat transport. Higher defect concentration leads to lower ITC. Furthermore, when defects are in SiC or Diamond, which have broader phonon spectral distributions, their impact on ITC is weaker. For the GaN/SiC interface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a defect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present in GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC. This behavior arises from defect-induced phonon energy redistribution near the interface. The redistribution increases the population of low-frequency phonons, which are more capable of crossing the interface, thus enhancing heat transfer. This study enriches the fundamental understanding of thermal transport across semiconductor heterointerfaces and guides the design and fabrication of high-ITC heterostructures.</p>

The double-peak structure of NMR spectra emerging above 29 T applied along the [001] direction evidences the successive magnetic transitions. The field dependence of NMR spectra was analyzed on the basis of cluster mean-field theory, which allows us to propose possible magnetic structures for the high-field magnetic states.</p>

            <p>Chiral materials are rare in nature, yet they play a fundamental role in modern physics due to their unconventional topological properties and transport responses. While chiral charge and structural orders have been extensively studied, chiral magnetic order -- particularly in altermagnets (AMs) -- remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the experimentally well-characterized three-dimensional metal-organic framework K[Co(HCOO)$_3$] represents the first realization of a chiral second-order topological insulator with altermagnetic order. This system hosts $\emph{g}$-wave spin-split bands, controllable second-order topological states, and chirality-locked anomalous transport properties. Its second-order topological phase manifests as alternating spin-up and spin-down hinge modes along the boundaries of hexagonal nanotubes. Remarkably, these spin-polarized hinge states can be switched through lattice chiral inversion. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical effects exhibit reversed signs in left/right-handed enantiomers, substantiating a universal chirality-controlled response across both electronic and optical channels. Our results establish chiral AMs as a promising platform for non-volatile topological spintronics, opening new avenues for manipulating quantum transport via lattice chirality.</p>

            <p>Finding the time dependent perturbation that extracts the maximal amount of energy (a.k.a. ergotropy) from a thermally isolated quantum system is a central, solved, problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum ergotropy problem.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that a continuous two frequency drive is a versatile and robust protocol to control the lifetime of quantum many body scars and to engineer non-equilibrium phases of driven quantum matter. By modulating the frequency ratio $c$ (any rational number), we systematically explore prethermal features across a broad frequency range. For small integer values of $c$, we observe ergodicity breaking even at moderately low frequencies, signaling long-lived scarred dynamics. By continuously increasing $c$, one can generate non-monotonic transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an effective Floquet Hamiltonian based approach. Furthermore, we exploit this tunability to engineer fractional subharmonic responses, highlighting the potential of two-frequency driving as a theoretical platform for controlling scars, prethermalization, and time crystal-like behavior.</p>

            <p>This thesis develops exact analytical tools to study strongly correlated stochastic systems, with a focus on extreme value statistics, gap statistics, and full counting statistics in multi-particle processes. A central contribution is the universal characterization of conditionally independent identically distributed variables-random variables that become independent upon conditioning on latent parameters. This structure arises naturally in systems with stochastic resetting, a mechanism that generates strong long-range correlations while retaining analytical tractability. Using this framework, we derive universal closed-form expressions for several observables across diverse models, including Brownian motion, Levy flights, ballistic particles, and Dyson Brownian motion, under various resetting protocols. In particular, we demonstrate that resetting induces analytically tractable non-equilibrium steady states. Theoretical predictions are supported by numerical comparisons and experimental comparisons in systems such as diffusive particles in switching harmonic traps. Applications to search optimization are also explored, identifying regimes where resetting enhances or impairs first-passage efficiency, and proposing rescaling-based protocols that outperform traditional resetting.</p>

            <p>We discuss the Fermi-velocity renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene due to Coulomb exchange interaction within an atomistic tight-binding model. Adopting the Slater-Koster parametrization for the hopping parameters obtained from first principles, our results only depend on the effective dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the Hubbard-interaction $U$. The Fermi velocity of graphene increases twist-angle independent by $~25\%$ for $\epsilon=10$ and $U=4eV$, leading to an increase by more than $100\%$ of the flat bandwidth at twist-angle $\theta=1.4^\circ$. Including also the renormalization of the out-of-plane hopping terms, we further observe a shift of the magic angle from $1.02^\circ$ to $0.96^\circ$. Our results offer a microscopic explanation of the critical temperature, $T_c$, as function of the twist angle where the largest $T_c$ is found at $\theta_{max}=1.1^\circ$. For $\theta>\theta_{max}$, $T_c$ is obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the Cooper channel. For $\theta<\theta_{max}$, the discussion is based on the critical line of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition.</p>

            <p>The triple-Q state arises due to the superposition of three symmetry equivalent spin spirals stabilized by higher-order exchange interactions. It has been predicted more than 20 years ago but was only recently discovered in a Mn monolayer on the Re(0001) surface. To date little is known about the thermodynamic properties of this intriguing non-coplanar spin state. Here, we reveal a low-temperature phase transition between the triple-Q and the row-wise antiferromagnetic state in this system via Monte Carlo simulations based on an atomistic spin model parametrized by density functional theory. By modeling the free energy landscape in terms of thermal excitations we derive an analytical expression of the partition function, which allows us to prove that the phase transition is driven by entropy. The predicted phase transition is not unique to Mn/Re(0001) but appears for a wide range of magnetic interaction parameters and is expected to occur also for other multi-Q states.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin Hall edge transport in two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides depends on whether their one-dimensional edge channels are preserved under realistic substrates and device boundaries. Here we implement spin-orbit coupling in DFTB and GFN-xTB within the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, and apply it to 1T$'$/2H WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Edge-projected spectra reveal robust edge states in 1T$'$ ribbons; and these states remain robust against a laterally infinite 2H substrate, which only shifts the Dirac point via long-wavelength corrugation without introducing additional in-gap states. By contrast, terminated 2H edges generate trivial dispersion branches in the same energy window that hybridize only weakly with the topological edge modes. In the bulk, Fermi-level states are 1T$'$-derived; at the small twist angle, lattice-relaxation-induced strain drives miniband reconstruction, whereas at the large twist angle, the layers become electronically decoupled. These findings suggest the conditions -- controlled twist angle and avoidance of terminated 2H edges -- for achieving quantized conductance and unambiguous spectroscopic</p>

            <p>We investigate the consequences of information exchange between a system and a measurement-feedback apparatus that cools the system below the environmental temperature. A quantitative relationship between entropy pumping and information acquired about the system is derived, showing that, independent of the concrete realization of the feedback, the latter exceeds the former by a positive amount of excess information flow. This excess information flow satisfies a trade-off relation with the precision of the feedback force, which places strong constraints on both the information-theoretic cost of feedback cooling and the required magnitude of the feedback force. From these constraints, a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of optical feedback cooling is derived. Finally, the results are demonstrated for feedback cooling by coherent light scattering. We show that measurement precision is the major factor determining the attainable temperature. Precise measurements can also be leveraged to reduce the required feedback force, leading to significantly more energy-efficient cooling close to the fundamental bound for realistic parameter values.</p>

            <p>CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density (JON) and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct tunneling (DT) and Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric (FE) switching, DT, FN tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high JON and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications.</p>

This property arises from the frequency dispersion of its dielectric function, which makes Maxwell equations a non-standard eigenvalue equation, with the eigenvalue (frequency) appearing inside the operator itself. We study this new Berry curvature effect on time refraction of magnetoplasmon-polariton as an example. It can induce deflection in the trajectory of a photon and make the ray swing.</p>

            <h2>Inertia Tames Fluctuations in Autonomous Stationary Heat Engines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrique P. Cital, Viktor Holubec</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) provide fundamental constraints on the interplay between power fluctuations, entropy production, and efficiency in overdamped stationary autonomous heat engines. However, their validity in underdamped regimes remains limited and less explored. Here, we analytically and numerically study a physically realizable autonomous heat engine composed of two underdamped continuous degrees of freedom coupled to a two-level system. We show that this nonlinear setup can robustly violate TUR-based trade-offs by exploiting resonant coupling, effectively using one underdamped mode as an internal periodic drive. When this coupling is suppressed, the system recovers TUR-like bounds consistent with overdamped theory. Importantly, we demonstrate that the strongest suppression of current fluctuations occurs in a resonance regime that can be directly inferred from mean current measurements - a quantity typically much easier to access experimentally than fluctuations. Our results reveal new pathways to circumvent classical TUR constraints in underdamped systems and provide practical guidelines for designing efficient, precise microscopic engines and autonomous clocks.</p>

            <h2>A collisional model of odd fluids: from Boltzmann equation to chiral hydrodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ege Eren, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli</p>
            <p>When the time-reversal and parity symmetries in a fluid are broken, transverse transport coefficients can arise in response to perturbations, an example being odd viscosity. We refer to these systems as odd fluids. While much progress has been made in the continuum theory of odd-viscous fluids, and non-collisional models for odd viscous fluids have been proposed, a classical microscopic description in which the transverse responses originate from collisions is lacking. In this paper, we show that a dilute granular gas of rough and inelastic particles driven by a constant torque is a minimal microscopic model of an odd fluid. By applying the methods of Boltzmann kinetic theory, we obtain a hydrodynamic description of the microscopic model. Then, using the method of adiabatic elimination, we numerically compute all the response coefficients of the model, explicitly showing that the model has many odd response terms. Our theory predicts that certain odd response coefficients can change sign even when the direction of the external torque is fixed. While we choose a particular case, the procedure we present can be applied to any collisional model. We also present a semi-quantitative method to determine the hydrodynamic variables of the theory by observing the eigenvalue spectrum of the linear collision operator.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) in infinite-layer nickelate films with different disorder levels. The disordered NdNiO$_{2}$ film exhibits a flat $S/T$ curve, whereas cleaner samples display a logarithmic divergence with decreasing temperature, followed by a pronounced ``hump'' near 25 K. These distinct behaviors reveal a disorder-driven transition from band-structure-dominated transport to quantum-critical-dominated transport. Below the ``hump'' temperature, four-fold symmetry breaking is observed in the in-plane angular magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic order in parent infinite-layer nickelate films. Furthermore, the logarithmic divergence in $S/T$ is also observed in a clean superconducting Sm$_{0.73}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.22}$NiO$_{2}$ film, where it coexists with linear-in-temperature resistivity over the same temperature range. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum criticality over a wide doping range in clean infinite-layer nickelate films, similar to cuprates, which highlights the central role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in their superconducting pairing mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Variability of motility behavior in populations of microbiological agents is an ubiquitous phenomenon even in the case of genetically identical cells. Accordingly, passive objects introduced into such biological systems and driven by them will also exhibit heterogeneous motion patterns. Here, we study a biohybrid system of passive beads driven by active ameboid cells and use a likelihood approach to estimate the heterogeneity of the bead dynamics from their discretely sampled trajectories. We showcase how this approach can deal with information-scarce situations and provides natural uncertainty bounds for heterogeneity estimates. Using these advantages we particularly uncover that the heterogeneity in the system is time-dependent.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism is a novel magnetic phase combining characteristics of both antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetic ordering. Despite growing theoretical interest in altermagnetic materials, reports of experimentally verified high Neel temperature layered compounds are limited or remain to be firmly established. Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we identify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature of 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of altermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature dependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable band shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel temperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These findings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetic phenomena.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin structures with non-trivial topology that comprise two-dimensional quasi-particles and are promising information carriers for data storage and processing devices. Skyrmion lattices in magnetic thin films exhibit Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) phase transitions and have garnered significant interest for studying emergent 2D phase behavior. In experimental skyrmion lattices, the main factor limiting the quasi-long-range order in thin films has been the non-flat energy landscape - often referred to as pinning effects. We demonstrate direct control of the skyrmion lattice order by effectively tuning the energy landscape employing magnetic field oscillations. By quantifying lattice order and dynamics, we explore how domain boundaries form and evolve due to pinning effects in Kerr microscopy experiments and in Brownian dynamics simulations, offering a pathway to control and study emergent skyrmion lattice properties and 2D phase behavior.</p>

            <p>Reports of photoluminescence from GeSn grown on Ge substrates by molecular beam epitaxy have been limited. We find that one limiting factor to observing photoluminescence is due to localized defect states marked by photoluminescence at 2400 nm and originating from the Ge substrate and buffer layer. In this study, we report on an optical study utilizing doped Ge(001) substrates to effectively suppress defect-related photoluminescence in GeSn layers by filling localized defect trap states. For this experiment, a GeSn layer with Sn content up to 10.5% was grown on a doped Ge(001) substrate. Analysis of the physics of the photoluminescence spectrum collected from the GeSn thin film shows an emission at the expected wavelength of 2300 nm for 10.5% Sn content and the absence of the typically observed defect related signal at 2400 nm. This understanding is further confirmed using short pulse optical excitation of the GeSn grown on undoped Ge substrates.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation at room temperature offers a promising pathway toward quantum photonic technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. A key challenge in this field is to engineer a controlled platform where strong confinement, nonlinear interactions, and structural disorder coexist, unlocking access to rich collective behavior and unconventional condensate dynamics. We demonstrate polariton condensation in CsPbBr$_3$ microplatelets that self-assemble into whispering gallery mode microresonators featuring tight lateral photon confinement finely balanced with intrinsic disorder. The system exhibits hallmark signatures of out-of-equilibrium condensation, including a non-linear increase in emission intensity, spectral narrowing, and interaction-induced blueshift. Intrinsic disorder subtly reshapes the cavity energy landscape, inducing condensate fragmentation and enabling direct optical access to the condensate wavefunction. Interferometric measurements reveal extended phase coherence, whereas characteristic fork-shaped fringe dislocations confirm the presence of quantized vortices pinned by the disordered potential. These topological excitations underscore the rich physics driven by the interplay of gain, loss, confinement, and disorder. Our work establishes a scalable platform for investigating driven-dissipative quantum fluids of light at room temperature, where the intrinsic disorder balances optical confinement and provides a window into condensate wavefunction, coherence, and vortex phenomena. This study system opens new opportunities for exploring many-body physics and potentially advancing topological photonics in integrable microcavity architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei I. Pavlov, Mikhail N. Kiselev</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum noise in a mesoscopic quantum dot serving as a realization of the charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model weakly coupled to a fermionic lead via a tunnel contact. We find noise signatures under voltage and temperature biases that can serve as clear markers of the SYK physics in experiments with related setups. We develop a linear response theory that treats all types of noise on the same footing and generalizes a concept of transport coefficients for charge and heat currents, as well as relations between them, to equilibrium noise power. Within this theory, we find characteristic scaling of the noise coefficients with temperature in all regimes that can be relevant for experimental realizations of the SYK dots, find a set of universal constants, with their values being unique to the SYK physics, that connect these coefficients, and characterize noise manifestations of the Coulomb blockade. Beyond SYK systems, these results may serve as a general framework for identification of non-Fermi-liquid signatures in mesoscopic transport and provide additional observables for experiments on thermoelectric phenomena.</p>

            <p>We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</p>

            <p>Topological invariants, rigorously defined only in the thermodynamic limit, have been generalized to topological indicators applicable to finite-size disordered systems. However, in many experimentally relevant situations, such as semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) hybrid nanowires hosting Majorana zero modes, the interplay between strong disorder and finite-size effects renders these indicators (e.g., the so-called topological visibility) biased and ill-defined, significantly limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we propose the topological invariant rigorously defined for an infinite system constructed by periodically repeating the original finite disordered system, as a topological indicator. Using the one-dimensional SM-SC hybrid nanowire as an example, we show that this general and transparent approach yields faithful topological indicators free from the biases affecting commonly used finite-size indicators, capturing the nature (topological or trivial) of the phase at generic points in parameter space, and providing a reliable tool for interpreting experimental results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautham Varma K, Azaz Ahmad, Gargee Sharma</p>
            <p>Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties. Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our study to be particularly timely and relevant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyung-Su Kim</p>
            <p>We study how a weak perpendicular magnetic field $B$ and a Berry curvature $\Omega$ modify the magnetic interactions of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC), using the semi-classical large-$r_s$ expansion. When only a magnetic field is present, various ring-exchange interactions arise from electron tunneling along {\it complex} trajectories, which constitute {\it complex instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in $B$, each ring-exchange constant acquires an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase equal to the magnetic flux enclosed by the real tunneling trajectory of the $B=0$ problem. This effect is directly relevant to two-dimensional electron systems with a small $g$-factor ($g \ll 1$). In the presence of a Berry curvature, multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a (complexified) phase space $({\bf r}, {\bf k})$. To leading order in $\Omega$, the exchange constants acquire the Berry phase enclosed by a {\it purely imaginary} trajectory in a momentum space. Finally, when both $B$ and $\Omega$ are non-zero, in addition to having the AB and Berry phase factors, the magnitude of the exchange constant can also be renormalized by an effective-mass correction. These effects may be relevant for the WC and its proximate phases recently observed in tetra- and penta-layer rhombohedral graphene.</p>

            <p>The growing demand for photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are lightweight, flexible, and seamlessly integrated into diverse applications has propelled interest in thin-film solar cells. Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition.</p>

            <p>Michaelis-Menten kinetics is one of the most recognized models in enzyme kinetics, crucial for the understanding of biochemical reactions in several metabolic processes. In this study, we perform a stochastic analysis of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the introduction of inhibitory mechanisms, which significantly diversifies the study of the reaction. We apply the Fock space formalism to reformulate the master equation, transforming it into a Schrödinger-type equation. We investigate reversible inhibitions and analyze the behavior of the averaged number of substances involved, identifying a stiffness behavior in all scenarios. In a specific case of partial inhibition, we observe that the inhibitor can act as an activator that favors product formation. We calculate the first product formation time (FPFT), which characterizes the time statistic of the first product formation. We observe the emergence of an intermediate time scale in addition to the two known time scales typical in first-passage problems. This intermediate time scale is closely aligned with the slow-binding kinetics observed in experimentally observed enzymatic reactions that involve inhibitors. This intermediate time scale is related to the new pathways introduced by the presence of inhibitors. This study offers a new perspective on inhibited enzymatic reactions, and demonstrates the usefulness of the Fock space formalism in the analysis of complex chemical systems.</p>

            <p>Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions.

            <p>As deep learning applications continue to deploy increasingly large artificial neural networks, the associated high energy demands are creating a need for alternative neuromorphic approaches. Optics and photonics are particularly compelling platforms as they offer high speeds and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic systems based on nonlinear optics promise high expressivity with a minimal number of parameters. However, so far, there is no efficient and generic physics-based training method allowing us to extract gradients for the most general class of nonlinear optical systems. In this work, we present Scattering Backpropagation, an efficient method for experimentally measuring approximated gradients for nonlinear optical neural networks. Remarkably, our approach does not require a mathematical model of the physical nonlinearity, and only involves two scattering experiments to extract all gradient approximations. The estimation precision depends on the deviation from reciprocity. We successfully apply our method to well-known benchmarks such as XOR and MNIST. Scattering Backpropagation is widely applicable to existing state-of-the-art, scalable platforms, such as optics, microwave, and also extends to other physical platforms such as electrical circuits.</p>

Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of N independent two-level electrons interacting with Schrödinger cat or kitten states of light. Without measurement, a macroscopic cat state of electrons appears only in an ultrashort time window. In contrast, we demonstrate that photon-number parity or quadrature projective measurements can restore a macroscopic cat state in nonequilibrium electrons, even in the thermodynamic limit. These dynamics are captured by an external-field approximation, in which the electronic system evolves into a Rabi-oscillation cat state. Our results highlight the need for precise quantum measurement techniques for light to control macroscopic quantum states of matter driven by quantum light.</p>

In this work, we reformulate the orbital part of the wavefunction using Givens rotation matrices, enabling an analytical treatment of the variational optimization. By combining the low-rank APG with the direct Givens rotation (DGR) method, we achieved a significant improvement in optimization efficiency. We applied the developed method to small molecular systems and confirmed that it provides high accuracy, while also significantly reducing the computational time compared to conventional methods.</p>

            <p>Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</p>

            <p>Precise allocation of nano light-sources in photonic integrated circuits is essential for the development of next-generation optical technologies such as optical nano-circuits, quantum information processing, and quantum communication. However, controlling the position of such light sources is a challenging task. We here show that halide perovskite nanoparticle light sources can be generated at the desired positions by electron beam. We applied cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 composite produced by thermal evaporation and discovered that the intensity of green light emission from the CsPbBr3 nanoparticles increased with electron beam irradiation. Changes in the cathodoluminescence spectrum associated with the electron beam irradiation suggest CsPbBr3 nanoparticle formations. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the high spatial resolution and controllability of the electron beam, we demonstrate nano-light source patterning on the film.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for ultra-water-rich ammonia hydrates stabilized in icy exoplanetary mantles</h2>

            <p>Understanding the behavior of the water-ammonia system at high pressure-high temperature conditions is important for modeling the internal dynamics of exoplanet icy mantles. Conventionally, mixtures of ammonia hemihydrate AHH (2:1 ammonia-water molar ratio) and H2O ice VII have been regarded as the ultimate solid phase assembly in the system. Here we report evidence for chemical reactions between AHH and ice VII above 750 K and 16 GPa that stabilize water-rich ammonia hydrates, including a novel ultra-water rich hydrate NH3.6H2O (1:6 ratio) coexisting with ammonia dihydrate ADH (1:2 ratio) and excess ice VII. This assembly is stable up to at least 30 GPa and 1600 K and can be quenched to room temperature. Our results demonstrate that water-rich ammonia hydrates are favored in the icy mantle of 1-2 MEarth exoplanets regardless of the ammonia content of the hydrate crystallized during accretion and/or evolution as long as excess H2O ice is available. The buoyancy contrast between water-rich hydrates and ice VII may lead to chemical stratification in exoplanet icy mantles, hence affecting their thermal evolution.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Open Quantum Walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maksym Szemer, Szymon Buchaniec, Grzegorz Brus</p>
            <p>The microstructure critically governs the properties of materials used in energy and chemical engineering technologies, from catalysts and filters to thermal insulators and sensors. Therefore, accurate design is based on quantitative descriptors of microstructural features. Here we show that eight key descriptors can be extracted by a single workflow that fuses computational topology with assembly-learning-based regression. First, 1312 synthetic three-dimensional microstructures were generated and evaluated using established algorithms, and a labeled data set of ground-truth parameters was built. Converting every structure into a persistence image allowed us to train a deep neural network that predicts the eight descriptors. In an independent test set, the model achieved on average R^2 ~ 0.84 and Pearson r ~ 0.92, demonstrating both precision and generality. The approach provides a unified and scalable tool for rapid characterization of functional porous materials.</p>

            <p>We consider the preparation of single-spinon wave functions, relevant for one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin models, in a quantum computer. We adopt the recently proposed ansatz \cite{kulk} for the single-spinon wave function, where a state with $S=1/2$ is built in a spin chain with $L+1$ sites, adding a site with $S_z=1/2$ to the configurations of the ground-state wave function for the spin chain with length $L$. We extend the original work to the case of the Haldane-Shastry model. We discuss how to prepare the single-spinon ansatz both for the Heisenberg and Haldane-Shastry models in quantum computers, using a linear combination of unitaries. We consider three different strategies to compute the single-spinon energy in a quantum computer and analyze their cost in terms of the number of qubits, gates, and circuits.</p>

            <h2>Load-Balanced Diffusion Monte Carlo Method with Lattice Regularization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kousuke Nakano, Sandro Sorella, Michele Casula</p>
            <p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the many-body Schrödinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations. QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers, making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework. DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance, which grows as $\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high parallel efficiency ($\sim$98\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\rm w}= 51200$), together with a speedup of $\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers.</p>

            <h2>Continuous-wave, high-resolution, ultra-broadband mid-infrared nonlinear spectroscopy with tunable plasmonic nanocavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Xie, Nobuaki Oyamada, Francesco Ciccarello, Wen Chen, Christophe Galland</p>
            <p>Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy is a technique to probe the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared wavelengths while detecting the upconverted signal at visible wavelengths. It has recently transitioned from large-area molecular films and colloidal suspensions to nanoscale structures, enabled by dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that confine light and matter in the same deep-subwavelength sensing volume. Here, we implement continuous-wave ultra-broadband SFG and DFG spectroscopy from $860$ to $1670~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ on a variety of dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. The use of a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and the absence of geometric phase-matching requirements speed up and simplify data acquisition. At the same time, simultaneous access to SFG and DFG sidebands permits ratiometric signal analysis, enabling both common-noise rejection and field-normalized characterization of coherent response. The resulting spectra harbour the signatures of coherent interference between the resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the $\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility, previously only observed under fs- and ps-pulsed excitation. We demonstrate the versatility and reproducibility of our approach across several molecules that yield distinct resonant and nonresonant mid-infrared responses. Together, these features position our platform as a scalable route toward multiplexed, high-resolution mid-IR sensing and a potential basis for coherent single- or few-molecule vibrational detection at the chip level.</p>

            <p>In the absence of decoherence the current of fermionic particles across a finite lattice connecting two reservoirs (leads) with different chemical potentials is known to be ballistic.

            <p>In this work, we describe a novel localization phenomena, the so-called topological defect accumulation, occurring in a non-Hermitian chain with an arbitrary number of defect sites. Specifically, it refers to the localization and coalescence of multiple defect eigenstates at a single defect site closest to the localization edge of the bulk non-Hermitian skin modes. This phenomenon is distinct from the conventional topological defect states in Hermitian systems, where the defect states are separately localized at their respective defect sites. The requirement for the onset of topological defect accumulation is the presence of non-reciprocal coupling which renders the chain non-Hermitian, as well as imaginary onsite potentials at the defect nodes. This allows the defect state accumulation and distribution to be modulated by both the defect site distribution and their corresponding onsite potentials paving the way for possible applications. Furthermore, this phenomenon is realizable in various synthetic and experimentally realizable platforms, such as topolectrical and photonic systems.</p>

            <p>Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic constraints, leading to ballistic and non-ergodic behavior at different detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation.</p>

            <p>The fermion sign problem constitutes one of the most fundamental obstacles in quantum many-body theory. Recently, it has been suggested to circumvent the sign problem by carrying out path integral simulations with a fictitious quantum statistics variable $\xi$, which allows for a smooth interpolation between the bosonic and fermionic limits [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This $\xi$-extrapolation method has subsequently been applied to a variety of systems and has facilitated the analysis of an x-ray scattering measurement taken at the National Ignition Facility with unprecedented accuracy [\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. Yet, it comes at the cost of performing an additional $10-20$ simulations, which, in combination with the required small error bars, can pose a serious practical limitation. Here, we remove this bottleneck by presenting a new re-weighting estimator, which allows the study of the full $\xi$-dependence from a single path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation. This is demonstrated for various observables of the uniform electron gas and also warm dense beryllium. We expect our work to be useful for future PIMC simulations of Fermi systems, including ultracold atoms, electrons in quantum dots, and warm dense quantum plasmas.</p>

We explore a new platform of Er$^{3+}$:CeO$_2$ films on silicon, offering low nuclear spin density and the potential for on-chip integration. We demonstrate a 38.8 $\mu$s spin coherence, which can be extended to 176.4\nobreakspace $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling.

            <p>Ammonia, a critical chemical fertilizer and a potential hydrogen carrier, can be sustainably synthesized from atmospheric nitrogen and water under ambient conditions through photocatalysis. In this study, high-entropy oxides with d0 and mixed d0+d10 cationic configurations are introduced as a new group of catalysts for nitrogen fixation and photocatalytic ammonia production. The oxides exhibit impressive efficiency in ammonia production compared to binary oxides, while the efficiency is improved by using a mixed cationic configuration. It was shown that the incorporation of d10 elements, such as gallium and zinc, boosts the photocatalytic reactions by improving light absorbance, charge separation and charge lifetime. These findings demonstrate the potential of high-entropy oxides as next-generation photocatalysts for green ammonia synthesis, offering an effective alternative to conventional catalytic systems.</p>

            <p>Dielectric breakdown of insulators is one of the most common failure modes of electronics in the high-radiation environment of space, but its mechanics remain poorly understood. When electron-irradiated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) undergoes breakdown, the resulting channels exhibit striking periodic structures with characteristic wavelengths ~80 {\mu}m in the recently identified ivy-mode channels. These previously unobserved modulations offer unique insights into the physics of ultra-fast dielectric breakdown. Through materials characterization and theoretical modeling, we identify the physical instability mechanism responsible for these structures. Raman spectroscopy reveals that carbon deposition correlates with channel width variations, indicating that periodic structure formation occurs during the plasma discharge phase. We evaluated three candidate instability mechanisms: the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, and the z-pinch entropy mode. The first two mechanisms operate on incompatible timescales and require unphysical material parameters to match observations. In contrast, the z-pinch entropy mode operates during the nanosecond discharge phase and produces wavelengths consistent with plasma densities of 0.1-1% of solid density and temperatures of 10-100 eV. Current measurements from isolated discharge channels (~200 A) validate theoretical predictions for the entropy mode. These findings establish that the entropy mode plasma instability during the discharge phase, rather than post discharge thermal or mechanical processes, govern periodic structure formation in breakdown channels. This work provides new insights into the physics of dielectric breakdown and establishes a framework for predicting discharge morphology and characteristics in insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce non-integrable singularities that may act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that material dissipation alone cannot regularize the singular behavior, in sharp contrast with reciprocal systems where any loss suffices. Instead, the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</p>

            <p>Accurately estimating ground-state energies of quantum many-body systems is still a challenging computational task because of the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the system size. Sample-based diagonalization (SBD) methods address this problem by projecting the Hamiltonian onto a subspace spanned by a selected set of basis configurations. In this article, we introduce two neural network-enhanced approaches for SBD: sample-based neural diagonalization (SND) and adaptive-basis SND (AB-SND). Both employ autoregressive neural networks to efficiently sample relevant basis configurations, with AB-SND additionally optimizing a parameterized basis transformation so that the ground-state wave function becomes more concentrated. We consider different classes of basis transformations: single-spin and non-overlapping two-spin rotations, which are tractable on classical computers, and also more expressive global unitaries that can be implemented using quantum circuits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques on various quantum Ising models, showing that SND achieves high accuracy for concentrated ground states, while AB-SND consistently outperforms both SND and more conventional SBD methods, allowing entering regimes in which the ground state is not concentrated in the original computational basis.</p>

            <p>Control over the interaction of waves with ultrafast time-varying materials - those that change on a time-scale commensurate with the wave period - holds much promise for developing a raft of new technologies. Time-varying materials exchange energy with the waves passing through them, thus exhibiting entirely new phenomena not possible with static media. Work to date has largely considered the realisation of ultrafast time-varying materials, with much less attention paid to how their interaction depends upon the shape of the incident waves themselves. Here we experimentally demonstrate 'waveform shaping' within ultrafast time-varying media: temporal shaping of incident pulses to optimise specific dynamic material interactions. We create an ultrafast time-varying medium by rapidly modulating a waveguide termination, and measure the spectrally resolved reflection matrix. Analysis of this reflection matrix enables the identification of the incident waveforms that undergo a desired spectral transformation. Using this approach, we first characterise the medium's eigenpulses; temporal modes that reflect from the medium without spectral distortion. Next, we identify the waveforms that are either maximally or minimally reflected, enabling strong broadband absorption arising from the temporal modulation of the medium. Finally, we show how energy can be optimally concentrated into a user-defined set of frequency bands upon reflection. Our work paves the way towards new applications of ultrafast time-varying media, spanning from optics to microwaves and acoustics.</p>

The augmented MOLOPT basis sets achieve fast convergence of $GW$ gaps and Bethe-Salpeter excitation energies, while maintaining low condition numbers of the overlap matrix to ensure numerical stability. For $GW$ HOMO-LUMO gaps, the double-zeta augmented MOLOPT basis yields a mean absolute deviation of 60 meV to the complete basis set limit. The basis set convergence for excitation energies from time-dependent density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is similar. We use our smallest generated augmented MOLOPT basis (aug-SZV-MOLOPT-ae-mini) to demonstrate $GW$ calculations on nanographenes with 2312 atoms requiring only 3500 core hours and 2.9 TB RAM as computational resources.</p>

            <p>We investigate photon production from media characterized by a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5(t)$. We first consider the chiral anomaly as a small perturbation and show that $\mu_5\to 2\gamma$ process generates non-polarized radiation, as the probabilities of producing right and left-handed photons are equal. In chiral semimetal with a vanishing chiral chemical potential but a finite separation of Weyl nodes, ${\bf \Delta}(t)$, the photon production vanishes at the leading order of perturbation theory. We then employ the method of Bogolyubov transformation to obtain the photon spectrum that sums up all powers of $\mu_5$. Employing the exactly solvable model $\mu_5(t) \propto A+B\tanh(t/\tau)$, we demonstrate that the spectrum exhibits strong circular polarization, whose direction is determined by the sign of $\mu_5$. The spectrum contains resonances associated with the instability of the electromagnetic field in chiral media. We discuss potential phenomenological applications of these findings.</p>

            <p>The single droplet under shear is a foundational problem in fluid mechanics. In computational fluid dynamics, the two-dimensional (2D) formulation offers advantages in both computational efficiency and relevance, yet its theoretical treatment remains relatively underdeveloped. In this brief note, we present an analytical treatment of this problem, beginning with a derivation of the Lamb solution for 2D Stokes flows, which in turn is used to obtain the flow fields around a droplet in a purely extensional flow. Using these flow fields, expressions are obtained for the apparent viscosity, $\mu^*$, of a dilute emulsion as well as a small deformation theory. We show that $\mu^* = \mu( 1 + f(\lambda) \phi) + \mathcal{O}(\phi^2)$ with $f(\lambda) = (2\lambda + 1)/(\lambda + 1)$ where $\lambda$ is the ratio of the droplet viscosity to the matrix viscosity and $\phi$ is the area fraction covered by the suspended phase. Also the steady state value of the Taylor deformation parameter $D_T^\infty$, in the capillarity-dominated regime, obeys $D_T^\infty = g(\lambda)\,\text{Ca}$, where Ca is the capillary number and $g(\lambda) = 1$. This contrasts with the 3D case, where $g(\lambda)$ depends on $\lambda$. These results are then validated through direct numerical simulations across a wide range of viscosity ratios ($0.01 < \lambda < 100$). Our results provide a basic theoretical framework for interpreting 2D droplet simulations and provide clear benchmarks for computational fluid dynamics.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined water plays a key role in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and catalysis, yet its reactivity remains a matter of debate. Prior studies have reported both enhanced and suppressed water self-dissociation relative to the bulk, but without a consistent explanation. Here, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials trained at first-principles accuracy, we investigate dissociation behavior in water confined within 2D slit pores and nanodroplets, using graphene and hexagonal boron nitride as model materials. We find that reactivity is extremely sensitive to water density, confinement width, geometry, material flexibility, and surface chemistry. Despite this complexity, we show that chemical potential -- together with interfacial interactions -- governs dissociation trends and explains the variability observed in prior studies. This thermodynamic perspective reconciles previous contradictions and reveals how nanoscale environments can drastically shift water reactivity. Our findings provide molecular-level insight and offer a design lever for modulating water chemistry at the nanoscale.</p>

Wavefunction-based theories, in contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface, where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of complex catalytic systems.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic syndrome decoder in volume-law phases of hybrid quantum circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawid Paszko, Marcin Szyniszewski, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.</p>

            <p>This paper is part of a bottom-up approach to gravitational thermodynamics that is guided by the axiomatic frameworks of equilibrium thermodynamics. We identify a novel form of the microcanonical distribution for systems in background gravitational fields that respects the kinetic theory and the thermodynamic symmetries. Thermodynamic consistency dictates the treatment of the gravitational field as a thermodynamic variable. We introduce the thermodynamic conjugate to the gravitational field, the gravitational pull, an additive variable that is a structural element of our microcanonical distribution. We demonstrate the validity of our results to inhomogenous background fields, a class of self-gravitating systems, relativistic gases in Rindler spacetime, and quantum gases.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Symmetries From Fusion Actions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chongying Dong, Siu-Hung Ng, Li Ren, Feng Xu</p>
            <p>Let $A$ be a condensable algebra in a modular tensor category $\EuScript{C}$. We define an action of the fusion category $\EuScript{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\EuScript{C}$ on the morphism space $\mbox{Hom}_{\EuScript{C}}(x,A)$ for any $x$ in $\EuScript{C}$, whose characters are generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\EuScript{B}$ of $\EuScript{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\EuScript{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\EuScript{B}$ to $A^\EuScript{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\EuScript{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\EuScript{C}_A}$ where $\EuScript{C}=\EuScript{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\EuScript{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p>

The system and the reservoirs evolve and interact via random collision described by a Kac-type master equation.

We show that, for times much shorter than $\sqrt{N}$ the interaction with the reservoirs is well approximated by the interaction with 2 Maxwellian thermostats, that is, heat reservoirs with $N=\infty$. As a byproduct, if $T_+=T_-$ we extend the results in \cite{BLTV} to particles in 3 dimension.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Palaia, Adelchi J. Asta, Megh Dutta, Patrick B. Warren, Benjamin Rotenberg, Emmanuel Trizac</p>
            <p>A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold.</p>

            <h2>Impurity screening by defects in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Hai Wu, Yueshui Zhang, Hong-Hao Tu, Meng Cheng</p>
            <p>We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini</p>
            <p>Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</p>

            <p>The criticality enhanced correlations and susceptibility allow weak periodic driving to induce collective synchronization due to critical slowing down, providing a unique platform to study non-equilibrium order emergence. This establishes a powerful paradigm for investigating non-equilibrium order formation, yet the fundamental mechanisms of critical-point synchronization remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce quantum synchronization at the critical point of Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the microwave periodic driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded temporal order in subspace, which triggers synchronization across the entire ensemble. The behavior of the emergent synchronized oscillation is elaborately linked to alterations in the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which result in phase-dependent seeding and embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body phenomena, offering insight into the behavior of complex many-body systems under seeding.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elizabeth J. Dresselhaus, Alexander Avdoshkin, Zhetao Jia, Matteo Secli, Boubacar Kante, Joel E. Moore</p>
            <p>Emerging experimental platforms use amorphousness, a constrained form of disorder, to tailor meta-material properties. We study localization under this type of disorder in a family of 2D models generalizing recent experiments on photonic systems. Models in this family reside on amorphous analogs of kagomé lattices with fixed coordination number, vary by a tunable synthetic field, and remarkabaly, permit exact results. We observe two kinds of localization that emerge in these models: Anderson localization by amorphous disorder, and the existence of compact, macroscopically degenerate localized states as in many crystalline flat bands. The flat-band-like degeneracy innate to kagomé lattices survives under amorphousness without on-site disorder. This phenomenon arises from the cooperation between the structure of the compact localized states and the geometry of the amorphous graph. More surprisingly, for particular values of the field, such states emerge in the amorphous system that were not present on the kagomé lattice in the same field. Outside the flat band, constrained amorphous graph geometry necessitates the existence of a fully delocalized state, near which we observe evidence of a localization-delocalization transition. Our platform serves as a demonstration of how the qualitative behavior of a disordered system can be tuned at fixed graph topology and lead to localization phenomena unique to amorphous systems that are not observed in their generically disordered counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Jie Jason Gao, Fu-Ling Yang, Michael C. Holcomb, Jerzy Blawzdziewicz</p>
            <p>We create a mechanical digger able to move within 2D densely-packed granular media, in a manner intrinsically different from the existing biomimic diggers. The characteristics of our design include that the average grain size is about one tenth as large as the digger, and the area packing density {\phi} is about 90% of the jamming density {\phi}c. Unlike conventional autonomous diggers that move by fluidizing the surrounding granular media with a much finer grain size, our digger swiftly bypasses this mobility mechanism as coarse grains with interparticle friction are hard to be fluidized. To cope with high interparticle friction, the digger has a circular shape and singly captures granular particles near the front entrance of the recess formed by the center unit running across its body and then ejects the captured particles backwards. We validate this moving strategy in both experiments using a manual digger and the corresponding numerical simulations, and demonstrate that the moving efficiency can be enhanced by the judgement of the human operator but the effectiveness is not significantly influenced by the shape of granular particles. In addition, localized vibration is needed to degrade friction between interlocked irregular-shaped particles. Our numerical results show that the distribution of both moving distances and time intervals between consecutive ejections follow a power-law Further, we experimentally verify this finding by demonstrating that similar power-laws are observed from an automated digger which regularly randomizes its digging direction. Finding these spatio-temporal power laws indicates that digging within a densely-packed granular environment could be a critical phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Dielectric breakdown of physical vacuum (Schwinger effect) is the textbook demonstration of compatibility of Relativity and Quantum theory. Although observing this effect is still practically unachievable, its analogue generalizations have been shown to be more readily attainable. This paper demonstrates that a gapped Dirac semiconductor, methylammonium lead-bromide perovskite (MAPbBr$_3$), exhibits analogue dynamical Schwinger effect. Tunneling ionization under deep sub-gap mid-infrared irradiation leads to intense photoluminescence in the visible range, in full agreement with quasi-adiabatic theory. In addition to revealing a gapped extended system suitable for studying the analogue Schwinger effect, this observation holds great potential for non-perturbative field sensing, i.e., sensing electric fields through non-perturbative light-matter interactions. First, this paper illustrates this by measuring the local deviation from the nominally cubic phase of a perovskite single crystal, which can be interpreted in terms of frozen-in fields. Next, it is shown that analogue dynamic Schwinger effect can be used for nonperturbative amplification of non-parametric upconversion process in perovskites driven simultaneously by multiple optical fields. This discovery demonstrates the potential for material response beyond perturbation theory in the Schwinger regime, offering extremely sensitive light detection and amplification across an ultrabroad spectral range not accessible by conventional devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manideep Gone, Srijata Lahiri, Nabyendu Das</p>
            <p>We report appearance of non-trivial zero energy corner modes in the form of topological defects (trimers) in a carefully designed 2D crystalline topological insulator. The proposed scenario is developed via an unconventional stacking of 1D topological atomic chains with crystalline mirror symmetry along the diagonal (y=x) line. Our analysis shows that by systematically varying the hopping parameters t (intra-chain), v (within the unit cell) and w (between the unit cells) the system exhibits more than one distinct non-trivial second order topological phases. These phases are distinguished by the zero energy corner modes. In one of these phases the system supports four zero modes. Two of them reside on the trimers and the rest on isolated sites situated at the corner along the diagonal line. However, in the second case, the zero modes on the isolated sites persist at the corners while the zero modes on the trimers vanish. A critical look at the phase evolution of the Bloch states helps in investigating the topology of these phases via using winding numbers. Our work also shows the bulk-corner correspondence that exist between the invariants and the zero modes at the corners. With four zero modes at the corners and a winding number as 2, we conclude that the system has transformed into a second order topological insulator via tuning of the hopping amplitudes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Toniolo, Sougato Bose</p>
            <p>In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional local spin systems, the XXZ model with random magnetic field is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOM), but assuming instead that the system's dynamics gives rise to a Lieb-Robinson bound (L-R) with a logarithmic lightcone, we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation, starting from a generic product state, of $ \alpha$-Rényi entropies, with $ \alpha $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law, that denotes a slow spread of entanglement. This is in sharp contrast with Anderson localized phases that show no dynamically generated entanglement. To prove this result we apply a general theory recently developed by us in arXiv:2408.00743 that quantitatively relates the L-R bounds of a local Hamiltonian with the dynamical generation of entanglement. Assuming instead the existence of LIOM we provide new independent proofs of the known facts that the L-R bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic light cone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have shown that the nonzero center of mass momentum pair density wave (PDW) is a widespread phenomenon observed over different superconducting materials. However, concrete theoretical model realizations of the PDW order have remained elusive. Here, we study a one-dimensional model with nearest-neighbor pairing attraction, i.e. a spinful Kitaev chain, under generic spin-orbit couplings such that the spin-rotation symmetry is fully broken. The most general superconducting order parameter is described by a spatial dependent $\mathbf{d}_i$-vector. We show that a spin-triplet pair density wave (t-PDW) emerges in the ground state and occupies a large part of the phase diagram. The $\mathbf{d_i}$-vector of the t-PDW rotates with a pitch $Q_{\rm pdw}$ along the chain and spans an ellipsoid. The pure t-PDW is fully gapped and realizes a class-DIII topological superconductor, characterized by two Majorana zero modes localized at each end of the chain and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into the exotic pure PDW superconductor and provide a possible explanation for the one-dimensional PDW detected along domain walls in monolayer iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se) and potentially realizable using other quantum structures in unconventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>The use of pressure to obtain new materials that can be recovered under ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples, such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended covalent-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO$_2$ has been extensively studied because of its status as a prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, has been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but below room temperature. Here we report ab initio calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O$_2$), rather than the compound CO$_2$, lowers the onset of C-polymerization at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~7 GPa (complete by ~23 GPa). Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We predict that this dense phase is an energetic material which can potentially be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature.</p>

            <p>We investigate the fundamental problem of a small density of bosonic impurities immersed in a dilute Bose gas at zero temperature. Using a rigorous perturbative expansion, we show that the presence of the surrounding medium enhances the repulsion between dressed bosonic impurities (polarons) in the regime of weak interactions. Crucially, this differs from prevailing theories based on Landau quasiparticles, which neglect the possibility of quantum degenerate impurities and predict an exchange-induced attraction. We furthermore show that the polaron-polaron interactions are strongly modified if the medium chemical potential rather than the density is held fixed, such that the medium-induced attraction between thermal impurities becomes twice the expected Landau effective interaction. Our work provides a possible explanation for the differing signs of the polaron-polaron interactions observed in experiments across cold atomic gases and two-dimensional semiconductors, and it has important implications for theories of quasiparticles and quantum mixtures in general.</p>

            <p>After fifty years of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the nature of the transition between their topological phases (confinement/deconfinement) remains challenging due to the absence of a local order parameter. In this work, we conduct a percolation analysis of Wegner's three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model using intensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling, offering fresh insights into the topological phase transitions of gauge-invariant systems. We demonstrate that, regardless of the connection rules, geometrical loops, constructed by piercing excited plaquettes percolate precisely at the thermal critical point $T_{\rm c}$, with critical exponents coinciding with those of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. Further, we construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters in a random-cluster representation, showing that they also percolate at $T_{\rm c}$, enabling access to all thermal critical exponents. Strikingly, the Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameters for both loops and FK clusters reveal a pseudo-first-order transition.

The MoSxOy nanoflakes were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. The sintered nanoflakes are 10-20 nm thick and self-assembled in the "nanoflower"-shape aggregates forming powder particles. The chemical composition and structure of the powders were studied by XPS, EDS and Raman spectroscopy, which show that the powders have different chemical composition and structure depending on the preparation conditions. These studies revealed the existence of different forms of MoS2 and its oxides in the powders. These features are impactful on electric transport properties. The current vs voltage (I-V) dependences of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal hysteresis-like behavior; and their loop width depends on the chemical composition and structure. In the samples with the highest content of Mo in the oxide/sulfoxide form the negative differential conductivity has been observed. The I-V curves of all MoSxOy nanoflake samples manifest the three-state resistive switching and the long-lasting transient charge/discharge on switching "on/off" the voltage across the sample, which evidences the role of interface charges in their conductivity. To describe theoretically the observed I-V curves, polar and electric-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, the Landau-Cahn-Hilliard approach considering flexo-chemical field has been used. The revealed in experiment and explained theoretically features of resistive switching and charge accumulation look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.</p>

Here, we extend the analysis to the spontaneously symmetry-broken antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of the repulsive Hubbard model. To this aim, we calculated two-particle quantities using dynamical mean-field theory for the AF-ordered Hubbard model and studied the possible occurrence of divergences of the irreducible vertex functions in the charge and spin sectors. Our calculations pinpoint the divergences in the AF phase diagram, showing that while the onset of AF order mitigates the breakdown of the perturbation expansion, it does not fully prevent it. Moreover, we have been able to link the changes in the dynamical structure of the corresponding generalized susceptibilities to the physical crossover from a weak-coupling (Slater) to a strong-coupling (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet, which takes place as the interaction strength is gradually increased. Finally, we discuss possible physical consequences of the irreducible vertex divergences in triggering phase-separation instabilities within the AF phase and elaborate on the implications of our findings for two-dimensional systems, where the onset of a long-range AF order is prevented by the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</p>

            <h2>Two-dimensional orbital-obstructed insulators with higher-order band topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olga Arroyo-Gascón, Sergio Bravo, Mónica Pacheco, Leonor Chico</p>
            <p>Obstructed atomic phases, with their realizations in systems of diverse dimensionality, have recently arisen as one of the topological states with greatest potential to show higher-order phenomena. In this work we report a special type of obstruction, known as orbital-mediated atomic obstruction, in monolayers of materials with spatial symmetry described by the space group $P$-$3m1$. By means of a minimal tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we show that this obstructed phase is related to the mismatch of the charge centers coming from the atomic limit with respect to the centers that are obtained from a reciprocal space description. Although we find atomic limits that correspond with occupied atomic sites, orbital-mediated atomic obstruction requires the presence of orbitals that have no support in real space. In order to demonstrate the nontrivial character of the obstruction, we confirm the presence of a filling anomaly for finite geometries that is directly associated with the bulk configuration, and discuss the role of the boundary states and their underlying mechanism. Several material examples are presented to illustrate the ubiquity of these nontrivial responses and, in turn, to discuss the differences related to the particular ground state configuration. In addition, we perform a survey of materials and elaborate a list of candidate systems which will host this obstructed phase in monolayer form.</p>

            <h2>Fibonacci-Modulation-Induced Multiple Topological Anderson Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijiang Ji, Zhihao Xu</p>
            <p>Topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) provide a mechanism for topological phase transitions in disordered systems and have implications for quantum material design. In this work, we investigate the emergence of multiple TAIs in a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain subject to Fibonacci modulation, which transforms a trivial band structure into a sequence of topologically nontrivial phases. This behavior is characterized by the appearance of zero-energy modes and changes in the $Z_2$ topological quantum number. As the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases increases, a feature that is closely related to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. In contrast to conventional TAI phases with fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases display multifractal properties. This model can be experimentally realized using a Bose-Einstein condensate in a momentum-space lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal features can be explored through quench dynamics.</p>

            <p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p>

            <p>Double perovskites containing heavy transition metal ions are an important family of compounds for the study of the interplay between electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. Here, by combining magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in two prototype rhenium-based double perovskite compounds, Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$. A type-I dipolar antiferromagnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{q} = (0, 0, 1)$ is observed in both compounds. At temperatures above the magnetic transitions, a quadrupolar ordered phase is identified. Weak spin excitations, which are gapped at low temperatures and softened in the correlated paramagnetic phase, are explained using a minimal model that considers both the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. At larger wavevectors, we observe dominant phonon excitations that are well described by density functional calculations.</p>

            <h2>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</p>

            <h2>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashton S. Bradley, Nils A. Krause</p>
            <p>We present a quantitative analytical framework for calculating two-point velocity correlations in compressible quantum fluids, focusing on two key classes of superfluid excitations: vortices and rarefaction pulses. We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Hao Zhong, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetry-enriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</p>

            <p>The ground-state properties of the supersolid polaron consisting of a neutral impurity immersed in a dipolar supersolid have recently been studied. Here, the optical response of an impurity in a dipolar supersolid is calculated and interpreted in terms of the contributions of the different excitation modes of the supersolid. The optical absorption spectrum reveals the two Van Hove singularities that correspond to the flattening of the two Goldstone modes of the supersolid at the Brillouin zone edge. A single peak is found in the superfluid regime corresponding to the roton minimum which diverges at the transition. We propose the response of an ionic impurity as an experimental probe for the supersolid excitations and show how this technique can be extended to neutral impurities with an electric or magnetic dipole moment.</p>

            <h2>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the thermal Hall effect can originate from magnons (magnon Hall effect), phonons (phonon Hall effect), or their combination (magnon-polaron Hall effect). The magnon-polaron Hall effect, first observed in Fe2Mo3O8, is particularly intriguing as its thermal Hall signal can be remarkably large. In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry is a well-established framework for understanding transport and optical responses in quantum materials. In this work, I study the photon drag effect in Dirac electrons using the quantum geometric interpretation of non-vertical optical transitions. Due to the particle-hole symmetry inherent in Dirac electrons, the shift photon-drag photocurrent is dominated by dissipationless Fermi surface contributions, connected to the dipole of quantum metric tensor. I find that this dipole is significantly enhanced by a small band gap in massive Dirac electrons and remains robust in the massless limit. I demonstrate the existence of a circular shift photon-drag current in the effective Hamiltonian at the L-point of bismuth, where the bands exhibit trivial topology, highlighting the ubiquity of the circular photon-drag effect in centrosymmetric materials.</p>

            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

By constructing a superposition ansatz of coboson states, we solve the Schrödinger equation for two fermion pairs under both attractive and repulsive interactions. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the potential of the coboson formalism for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems, achieving results comparable to standard exact diagonalization techniques.</p>

            <p>The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended version of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases characterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a similar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all topological transition points between any two distinct phases. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</p>

            <p>We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve $\sim 97.2\pm0.1\%$ test accuracy on MNIST and $\sim 88.0\pm0.1\%$ on Fashion-MNIST without requiring any significant hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.</p>

            <p>Associative polymers (APs) with reversible, specific interactions between ``sticker'' sites exhibit a phase behavior that depends on a delicate balance between distinct contributions controlling the binding. For highly-bonded systems, it is entropy that mostly determines if, on increasing concentration, the network forms progressively or \textit{via} a first-order transition. With the aim of introducing an experimentally-viable system tailored to test the subtle dependence of the phase behavior on the binding site topology, here we numerically investigate AP polymers made of DNA, where ``sticker'' sites made by short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a single sticker type, $(AA)_6$, and one with two distinct alternating types, $(AB)_6$. At low temperature, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond, the $(AA)_6$ system remains homogeneous, while the $(AB)_6$ system exhibits phase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions from simpler bead-spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer conformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind this separation arises from the different topological constraints associated with intra- versus inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a controllable, realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the thermodynamics of associative polymer networks depends on the bonding site architecture in a clean and controlled way.</p>

While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

We demonstrate this in LeanLJ, a package of functions, proofs, and code execution software that implements Lennard Jones energy calculations in periodic boundaries. We introduce a strategy that uses polymorphic functions and typeclasses to bridge formal proofs (about idealized Real numbers) and executable programs (over floating point numbers). Execution of LeanLJ matches the current gold standard NIST benchmarks, while providing even stronger guarantees, given LeanLJ's grounding in formal mathematics. This approach can be extended to formally verified molecular simulations, in particular, and formally verified scientific computing software, in general.

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest due to their tunable physical properties when stacked into homo- and hetero-structures. Twisting adjacent layers introduces moiré patterns that strongly influence the material electronic and thermal behavior. In twisted graphene systems, the twist angle critically alters phonon transport, leading to reduced thermal conductivity compared to Bernal-stacked configurations. However, experimental investigations into thermal transport in twisted structures remain limited. Here, we study the local thermal properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) using Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). We find an increase in thermal resistance of $0.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^6 KW^{-1}$ compared to untwisted bilayers, attributed to changes in both intrinsic thermal conductivity and the tip-sample interface. These results, supported by analytical modeling, provide new insight into thermal transport mechanisms in twisted 2D systems and offer a pathway toward thermal engineering in twistronic devices.</p>

Upon excitation by a short laser pulse, the polarization wave emits intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) radiation at the ferroelectric transverse optical phonon frequency, modulates the ferroelectric order parameter, and propagates uniaxially along the polar axis at hypersonic velocities of ~105 m/s.

The symmetries of the variously ordered phases are a major issue concerning the understanding of the stabilization of the ordered phases as well as concerning the interplay between the various types of order. EuAl$_4$ at room temperature has tetragonal symmetry with space group $I4/mmm$. The CDW phase has an incommensurately modulated crystal structure described by the modulation wave vector $\mathbf{q} \approx 0.17\mathbf{c}^{*}$. On the basis of various experiments, including elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, and second-harmonic generation, it has been proposed that the symmetry of the CDW phase of EuAl$_4$ could be centrosymmetric orthorhombic, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic or non-centrosymmetric tetragonal. Here, we report temperature-dependent, single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments that show that the CDW is a transverse CDW with phason disorder, and with non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the orthorhombic superspace group $F222(0\,0\,\sigma)00s$.Essential for this finding is the availability of a sufficient number of second-order ($2\mathbf{q}$) satellite reflections in the x-ray diffraction data set. The broken inversion symmetry implies that skyrmions might form due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, instead of a more exotic mechanism as it is required for centrosymmetric structures.</p>

            <h2>Anyon dispersion from non-uniform magnetic field on the sphere</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mina-Lou Schleith, Tomohiro Soejima, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moiré systems has raised the interesting possibility of realizing phases of itenerant anyons. Anyon dispersion is only possible in the absence of continuous magnetic translation symmetry (CMTS). Motivated by this, we consider anyons on the sphere in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field which breaks the ${\rm SU}(2)$ rotation symmetry, the analog of CMTS on the sphere, down to a ${\rm U}(1)$. This allows us to study the energy dispersion of the anyons as a function of $L_z$ angular-momentum, while maintaining the perfect flatness of single-particle dispersion. We parametrize the non-uniform field by a real parameter $R$ which concentrates the field at the north (south) pole for $R>1$ ($R < 1$), and show that, for our choice of field, any $p$-body correlation function evaluated in the space of Laughlin quasiholes can be mapped \emph{exactly} to a corresponding $p$-body correlation function in uniform field. In the thermodynamic limit, this enables us to analytically compute the interaction-generated spatially varying potential felt by the anyons. Remarkably, such spatially varying potential is sufficient to generate dispersion for the anyons, which we compute exactly, up to an overall scaling constant. The anyon dispersion in our model describes azimuthal motion around the sphere at a constant height, similar to spin precession. Our work therefore serves as a concrete demonstration that interaction alone can generate nonzero anyon dispersion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Börge Göbel, Samir Lounis</p>
            <p>Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</p>

            <h2>Extracting the singularity of a logarithmic partition function to investigate quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>In principle, the logarithm of a partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations in practice, since resolving the singularity of a logarithmic partition function requires extremely high-precision data,especially when distinguishing weakly first-order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite-size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the analytic terms. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many-body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first-order phase transitions, such as in JQ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many-body phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</p>

            <p>The interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom offers a versatile playground for the realization of a variety of correlated phases of matter. However, the types of spin-orbital interactions are often limited and challenging to tune. Here, we propose and analyze a new platform for spin-orbital interactions based upon a lattice of Wigner molecules in moiré transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Leveraging the spin-orbital degeneracy of the low-energy Hilbert space of each Wigner molecule, we demonstrate that TMD materials can host a general spin-orbital Hamiltonian that is tunable via the moiré superlattice spacing and dielectric environments. We study the phase diagram for this model, revealing a rich landscape of phases driven by spin-orbital interactions, ranging from ferri-electric valence bond solids to a helical spin liquid. Our work establishes moiré Wigner molecules in TMD materials as a prominent platform for correlated spin-orbital phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongjin Kim, Robin Schäfer, David M. Long, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Anushya Chandran</p>
            <p>Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic, and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Chaotic instabilities thus far precede thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter leads to chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.</p>

            <p>The ferroelectric switching speed has been experimentally obfuscated by the interaction between the measurement circuit and the ferroelectric switching itself. This has prohibited the observation of real material responses at nanosecond timescales and lower. Here, fundamental polarization switching speeds in ferroelectric materials with the perovskite, fluorite, and wurtzite structures are reported. Upon lateral scaling of island capacitors from micron to nanoscales, a clear transition from circuit-limited switching to a material-limited switching regime is observed. In La$_{0.15}$Bi$_{0.85}$FeO$_{3}$ capacitors, switching is as fast as ~150 ps, the fastest switching time reported. For polycrystalline Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2}$ capacitors, a fundamental switching limit of ~210 ps is observed. Switching times for Al$_{0.92}$B$_{0.08}$N are near 20 ns, limited by the coercive and breakdown electric fields. The activation field, instantaneous pseudo-resistivity, and energy-delay are reported in this material-limited regime. Lastly, a criterion for reaching the material-limited regime is provided. This regime enables observation of intrinsic material properties and favorable scaling trends for high-performance computing.</p>

            <h2>Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohan Mittal, Tom Zander, Johannes Lang, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijie Xu, Sergei Nechaev</p>
            <p>We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a half-line $x \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) with distribution $Q(u_j)$, located at $x=0$. By computing the first two moments, $\langle G_N \rangle$ and $\langle G_N^2 \rangle$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over different disorder distributions, we provide the explicit condition for coincidence/distinction of pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the transition points of annealed and quenched systems are always different, although for finite systems there exists a "gray zone" in which this distinction may be hardly noticeable. This result may help reconcile opposing viewpoints on whether quenching is marginally relevant.</p>

We achieve an average shuttling fidelity of \SI{99.8}{\percent}. The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate. An appropriate four-level Hamiltonian model supports our findings. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing high-performance spin shuttling systems in future quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>S-substituted FeSe superconductors in the tetragonal phase display several unique features among iron-based superconductors, particularly the presence of zero-energy excitations in the superconducting (SC) state. The recent concept of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces (BFSs), a theoretical model describing ultranodal states, has attracted considerable interest. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) have revealed an anomalous low-energy spin fluctuations deep in the SC state. The low-energy spin fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature, supporting strong Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions associated with BFSs. Here, we further investigate these correlation effects through $^{77}$Se-NMR measurements of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) under pressures up to 2.0 GPa and temperatures down to ~100 mK. The results demonstrate that the anomalous enhancement is suppressed but persists under pressure, implying that quasiparticle interactions become weak by applying pressure. Furthermore, spin fluctuations in the normal state exhibit different temperature dependence from those deep in the SC state, suggesting that the nesting properties of normal electrons differ from those of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. These findings are consistent with the theoretical model of BFSs with C$_2$ symmetry and strengthen evidence for Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions, providing insights into the unconventional pairing state of this system.</p>

This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Chang Chen, Ken-Ming Lin</p>
            <p>Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics, combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhang, Wen-Tao Xu</p>
            <p>Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shibo Fang, Zongmeng Yang, Jianhua Wang, Xingyue Yang, Jing Lu, Xiaotian Wang, Yee Sin Ang</p>
            <p>The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Molly Brennan, Edwina F. Yeo, Philip Pearce, Mohit P. Dalwadi</p>
            <p>Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</p>

            <h2>Dynamically tunable hydrodynamic transport in boron nitride-encapsulated graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akash Gugnani, Aniket Majumdar, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Arindam Ghosh</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.</p>

            <h2>The superconducting diode effect in Josephson junctions fabricated from structurally chiral Mo$_3$Al$_2$C</h2>

            <p>The superconducting diode effect occurs in superconducting materials in which both spin and inversion symmetry are broken. The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries. Thus a Josephson junction interface with the left-handed structure on one side of the junction and the right-handed structure on the other should exhibit a diode effect. Here, we report the electrical transport properties of right-handed/left-handed and right-handed/right-handed devices fabricated from single crystals of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. A magnetic-field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in both devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $|I_{c-}|$, and we show evidence for a zero-field diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed device but not the right-handed/right-handed device. A maximum asymmetry of 5\% is observed in both devices. We provide a few explanations for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in these devices.</p>

            <h2>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiki Fukusumi</p>
            <p>The algebraic or ring structure of anyons, called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rules in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFT and categorical symmetry of the TO or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we present a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</p>

            <h2>Connectivity structure and dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David G. Clark, Owen Marschall, Alexander van Meegen, Ashok Litwin-Kumar</p>
            <p>Studies of the dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks often assume independent and identically distributed couplings, but large-scale connectomics data indicate that biological neural circuits exhibit markedly different connectivity properties. These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytic expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low-dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the \textit{Drosophila} connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Belitsky, N.P.N. Ngoc, G.M. Schütz</p>
            <p>We introduce the headway exclusion process which is an exclusion process with $N$ particles on the one-dimensional discrete torus with $L$ sites with jump rates that depend only on the distance to the next particle in the direction of the jump but not on $N$ and $L$. For measures with a long-range two-body interaction potential that depends only on the distance between neighboring particles we prove a relation between the interaction potential and particle jump rates that is necessary and sufficient for the measure to be invariant for the process. The normalization of the measure and the stationary current are computed both for finite $L$ and $N$ and in the thermodynamic limit. For a finitely many particles that evolve on $\mathbb{Z}$ unidirectionally it is proved by reverse duality that a certain family of non-stationary measures with a microscopic shock and antishock evolves into a convex combination of such measures with weights given by random walk transition probabilities. On macroscopic scale this domain random walk is a travelling wave phenomenon tantamount to phase separation with a stable shock and a stable antishock. Various potential applications of this result and open questions are outlined.</p>

            <h2>Strings as Hyper-Fractons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erica Bertolini, Hyungrok Kim</p>
            <p>We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</p>

            <h2>Magnon cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit system via two-magnon driving and dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Gen Li, Huatang Tan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Jafari, J. Naji, A. Langari, Vahid Karimipour, Henrik Johannesson</p>
            <p>We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</h2>

            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate vortex-induced losses and find the resistive component of the sensitivity to trapped flux $S$ to be approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The resistive sensitivity $S$ decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the reactive component, $S'$, exhibits a maximum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled within the Coffey-Clem framework in the zero-creep limit, under the assumption that vortex pinning is enhanced by thermally activated processes. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in laser excitation of the low-energy nuclear isomer transition in $^{229}$Th have opened avenues for developing nuclear clocks, a novel quantum technology with exceptional performance and sensitivity to exotic physics. Here we explore the host-dependence of the nuclear clock frequency, focusing on the isomer shift induced by the difference in the nuclear charge distribution between the ground and excited nuclear states. We combine relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure with periodic density functional theory to evaluate the isomer shifts in solid-state hosts. We elucidate the critical importance of the ``relaxation'' effect in evaluating the isomer shifts. Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: $ \omega_\text{clk}(\text{solid state}) = 2,020,407,384(40) \, \text{MHz}$, $\omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{4+}) = 2,020,407,648(70) \, \text{MHz}$, and $ \omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{3+}) = 2,020,407,114(70) \, \text{MHz}$. We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare $^{229}$Th nucleus to be $\omega_\text{nuc} = 8.272(22) \,\text{eV}$. Our calculated valence-band isomer shifts for different host materials constrain the nuclear transition frequencies to an 80 MHz-wide frequency window, aiding experimental searches for the $^{229}$Th nuclear transition in novel materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kühn, Gabriel Mahuas, Ulisse Ferrari</p>
            <p>Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.</p>

            <p>Large Atomistic Models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomistic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to August 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research.

            <p>We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. This measure characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix and is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity. We explore various aspects of capacity of entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We carefully examine the existence of a convenient entropic c-function based on this quantity both in bosonic and fermionic theories. While in the relativistic case the corresponding c-function displays a monotonic behavior under the RG flow, this is not the case for the nonrelativistic theories. We also investigate the dynamics of capacity of entanglement after a mass quench and show that it follows the quasiparticle interpretation for the spreading of entanglement. Finally, we discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including the entanglement entropy.</p>

            <p>Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional (3D), unit-cell-like ion clusters. We identify a set of transitions signaled by parity-odd octupole order parameters, and probe their distinct dynamical signatures. Our observations reveal the softening of a collective Higgs-like mode indicating spontaneous symmetry-breaking, hysteresis resulting from a catastrophe where a metastable state vanishes abruptly, and stochastic switching between metastable states of differing symmetries. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence of symmetry-breaking and discontinuous transitions, analogous to a thermodynamic triple point. Our results establish 3D trapped-ion clusters as a versatile platform to engineer complex potential energy landscapes, opening new avenues for studies of reaction kinetics, geometric frustration, and related phenomena in mesoscopic platforms.</p>

            <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.</p>

            <p>We study the steady flow-induced deformation between an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid and a three-dimensional (3D) deformable channel. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive experimental--theoretical framework for such flows of constant-viscosity viscoelastic (i.e., Boger) fluids, which allows us to quantify the influence of the fluid's viscoelasticity on the flow rate--pressure drop ($q-\Delta p$) relation. For a flow-rate-controlled regime and weakly viscoelastic flow, we find excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results, specifically providing an experimental demonstration of how both wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity decrease the pressure drop. To definitively demonstrate the coupled effect of wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity (change of cross-sectional area and curving of streamlines), we perform experiments in an equivalent rigid channel, showing that both the Boger fluid and a viscosity-matched Newtonian fluid have the same pressure drop. Thus, the experimentally verified theory for the $q-\Delta p$ relation of weakly viscoelastic flows of Boger fluids in compliant channels can now be used for the design of microfluidics and soft hydraulic systems operating with complex fluids.</p>

            <h2>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Praful Gagrani, Nino Lauber, Eric Smith, Christoph Flamm</p>
            <p>Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.</p>

            <p>We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter direct detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</p>

            <h2>Suppression of coherent light scattering in a three-dimensional atomic array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Kun Lu, Hanzhen Lin, Jiahao Lyu, Yoo Kyung Lee, Vitaly Fedoseev, Wolfgang Ketterle</p>
            <p>Understanding how atoms collectively interact with light is not only important for fundamental science, but also crucial for designing light-matter interfaces in quantum technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on arranging atoms in ordered arrays and using constructive (destructive) interference to enhance (suppress) the coupling to electromagnetic fields, thereby tailoring collective light-matter interactions. These studies have mainly focused on one- and two-dimensional arrays. However, only three-dimensional (3D) arrays can demonstrate destructive interference of coherent light scattering in all directions. This omnidirectional suppression of coherent light scattering in 3D atomic arrays has thus far not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we observe a strong reduction of light scattering in a 3D atomic array prepared in the form of a Mott insulator in optical lattices. The residual light scattering is shown to be caused by the delocalization of atoms, Raman scattering, and inelastic scattering associated with saturation. We also demonstrate how light scattering can be a sensitive probe for density fluctuations in many-body states in optical lattices, enabling us to characterize the superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition as well as defects generated by dynamical parameter ramps. The results of our work can be used to prepare subradiant states for photon storage and probe correlations for many-body systems in optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Light Induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Cubic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debabrata Sinha</p>
            <p>We investigate topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional electron system with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling driven by circularly polarized light. Within the Floquet framework, we demonstrate that light-matter interaction induces nontrivial band topology characterized by a quantized anomalous Hall response, with Chern insulating phases of C = 0, 1, and 3. These transitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light. Introducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space without modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains topologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are finite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter windows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic Rashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling strengths. These results clarify the interplay between distinct spin-orbit interactions in Floquet-engineered Chern insulators and offer experimentally relevant pathways for achieving light-controlled topological phases.</p>

To do this we compare results from the chiral soliton model with exact numerical solutions for the ground state of the three-particle Schrödinger equation in the limit that the spatial profile of the soliton is largely independent of its center-of-mass motion. The connection between the two approaches is found via the Page-Wootters mechanism, and this is what allows for dynamical evolution even in the quantum ground state, as required for a genuine quantum time crystal.</p>

            <p>Many efforts have been made in the past decade to realize topological superconductivity using superconducting proximity effect, but an ideal platform is still lacking. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform which gives rise to a topological phase that is robust against disorder. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading magnetic flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We theoretically show that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase occurs periodically for a wide range of $\Phi$, independently of the chemical potential. Our experiment found that a TI device of this structure indeed behaves as a columnar nano-SQUID where the supercurrent flows only through the top and bottom surfaces with vanishing bulk contribution. Furthermore, the top/bottom asymmetry can be tuned by a back gate, a key ingredient for the topological phase.</p>

            <p>We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases -- such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe -- topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the tetragonal $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using Topological Quantum Chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and temperature-induced structural changes lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe</p>

            <p>We construct an interacting Wannier model for both AA-stacked and AB-stacked twisted SnSe2, revealing a rich landscape of correlated quantum phases. For the AA-stacked case, the system is effectively described by a three-orbital triangular lattice model, where each orbital corresponds to a valley and exhibits an approximate one-dimensional hopping structure due to a new momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetry. By exploring the interacting phase diagram using a combination of theoretical methods, including Hartree-Fock mean-field theory and exact solutions of the spin model in certain limits, we identify several exotic quantum phases. These include a dimerized phase with finite residual entropy, valence bond solids, and quantum paramagnetism. In the AB-stacked case, the system realizes an interacting kagome lattice model, where the Wannier orbitals associated with the three valleys form three sublattices. In the strong coupling regime, we use cluster mean-field methods to demonstrate the emergence of a classical spin liquid phase due to the frustrated lattice structure. The high tunability of the moiré system, which allows control over both the filling and interaction strength (via twist angle), renders twisted SnSe2 a versatile platform for realizing a wide range of exotic correlated quantum phases.</p>

Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological) four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control in experimental realizations.</p>

            <p>The pressure-dependent evolution of the spin crossover (SCO) transition has garnered significant interest due to its connection to the giant barocaloric effect (BCE) near room temperature. Pressure alters both the molecular and solid-state structures of SCO materials, affecting the relative stability of low- and high-spin states and, consequently, the transition temperature ($T_{1/2}$). Crucially, the shape of the $T_{1/2}$ vs. pressure curve dictates the magnitude of the BCE, making its accurate characterization essential for identifying high-performance materials. In this work, we investigate the nonlinear $T_{1/2}$ vs. pressure behavior of the prototypical SCO complex [FeL$_2$][BF$_4$]$_2$ [L = 2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine] using solid-state PBE+U computations. Our results unveil the mechanisms by which pressure influences its SCO transition, including the onset of a phase transition, as well as the key role of low-frequency phonons in the BCE. Furthermore, we establish a computational protocol for accurately modeling the BCE in SCO crystals, providing a powerful tool for the rapid and efficient discovery of new materials with enhanced barocaloric performance.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the complementary properties of vanadium-based ferromagnets and HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics, we propose a novel multiferroic oxide, VHfO$_4$, through 50\% Hf$^{4+}$ substitution with V$^{4+}$ in the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ phase of HfO$_2$. First-principles DFT calculations reveal that the $Pca2_1$-like VHfO$_4$ phase exhibits dynamic stability and concurrent ferroic orders: robust ferroelectric polarization comparable to HfO$_2$ and V-driven magnetism. Parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations identify an antiferromagnetic ground state, while strain engineering enables tunable magnetoelectric coupling. Biaxial in-plane strain induces four magnetic states: intralayer FM/interlayer AFM, intralayer AFM/interlayer FM, spiral-like non-collinear order, and discrete alternating spin alignment. Critically, $c$-axis strain modulates magnetic energy landscapes, demonstrating electromechanical control of magnetism. This work establishes VHfO$_4$ as a Type-I multiferroic with coexisting atomic-scale ferroic origins and strain-tunable cross-coupling, offering a platform for voltage-controlled spintronics devices.</p>

This highlights the central role of Berry curvature in engineering orbital Hall responses. We also discuss the applicability of our framework by analyzing a realistic model.

            <p>We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p>

Due to the complex interactions between the rare earth elements and surrounding atoms, as well as hybridization with itinerant electrons, this family likely possesses highly intriguing and novel magnetic structures and thus exhibits dynamic behaviors. We systematically probe polycrystalline samples of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = La, Ce, Pr and Nd) combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS), heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The INS measurements identify well-resolved crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations at 19.2 and 24.9 meV in CeAlSi, at 5.4 meV in PrAlSi, and at 2.5 and 4.2 meV in NdAlSi. We analyzed the INS data using the corresponding CEF models and determined the CEF parameters and ground state wave functions of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd). Our results suggest strong single-ion anisotropy in their ground states: $|\pm3/2\rangle$ (94.5\%) in CeAlSi, $|\pm3\rangle$ (99.2\%) in PrAlSi, and $|\pm9/2\rangle$ (76.2\%) in NdAlSi. Notably, the weaker anisotropy and strong exchange interactions in NdAlSi promote competing magnetic orders and CEF splitting at low temperature, contrasting with the robust CEF levels in magnetic states of CeAlSi and PrAlSi.</p>

The reconstruction is orbital-selective, occurring predominantly in the $s$-orbital channel.

            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to non-reciprocal transport, where current flows without resistance in one direction but becomes resistive in the opposite direction, but its typical reliance on magnetic field hinders scalability and device integration. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for realizing a field-free SDE based on a two-dimensional (2D) Shiba lattice featuring a conical spin texture. Using the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations, we illustrate that the conical spin configuration alone is sufficient to break the necessary inversion and time reversal symmetries, enabling nonreciprocal supercurrent flow without any external magnetic field, yielding diode efficiency exceeding 40%. Furthermore, we find that the efficiency of such a diode effect becomes strongly dependent on the direction of current flow, revealing a pronounced angular dependence that can be tuned by varying the pitches of the spin texture along the two spatial lattice directions. Our findings offer a pathway toward scalable, field-free superconducting components for non-dissipative electronics and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>Computer simulations yield evidence of superfluid behavior of nanoscale size clusters of parahydrogen adsorbed on a graphite substrate at low temperature ($T\lesssim 0.25 \text{ K}$). Clusters with a number of molecules between 7 and 12 display concurrent superfluidity and crystalline order, reflecting the corrugation of the substrate. Remarkably, it is found that specific clusters with a number of molecules ranging between 7 and 12 self-diffuse on the surface like free particles, despite the strong pinning effect of the substrate. This effect is underlain by coordinated quantum-mechanical exchanges of groups of identical molecules, i.e., it has no classical counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Random Permutation Circuits are Quantum Chaotic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Bertini, Katja Klobas, Pavel Kos, Daniel Malz</p>
            <p>Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.</p>

            <h2>Majorana braiding simulations with projective measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Philipp Frey, Themba Hodge, Eric Mascot, Stephan Rachel</p>
            <p>We summarize the key ingredients required for universal topological quantum computation using Majorana zero modes in networks of topological superconductor nanowires. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of both sparse and dense logical qubit encodings, and on the transitions between them via projective parity measurements. Combined with hybridization, these operations extend the computational capabilities beyond braiding alone and enable universal gate sets. In addition to outlining the theoretical foundations-including the algebra of Majorana operators, along with the stabilizer formalism-we introduce an efficient numerical method for simulating the time-dependent dynamics of such systems. This method, based on the time dependent Pfaffian formalism, allows for the classical simulation of realistic device architectures that incorporate braiding, projective measurements, and disorder. The result is a semi-pedagogical overview and computational toolbox designed to support further exploration of topological quantum computing platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keshav Jha, Joseph Mayer</p>
            <p>Three-dimensional (3D) printed preoperative planning models serve a critical role in the success of many medical procedures. However, many of these models do not portray the patient's complete anatomy due to their monolithic and static nature. The use of dynamic 3D-printed models can better equip physicians by providing a more anatomically accurate model due to its movement capabilities and the ability to remove and replace printed anatomies based on planning stages. A dynamic 3D-printed preoperative planning model has the capability to move in similar ways to the anatomy that is being represented by the model, or reveal additional issues that may arise during the use of a movement mechanism. The 3D-printed models are constructed in a similar manner to their static counterparts; however, in the digital post-processing phase, additional care is needed to ensure the dynamic functionality of the model. Here, we discuss the process of creating a dynamic 3D-printed model and its benefits and uses in modern medicine.</p>

            <p>The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems. In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</p>

            <h2>Nodal pair density waves from a quarter-metal in crystalline graphene multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sk Asrap Murshed, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Crystalline graphene heterostructures, namely, Bernal bilayer graphene (BBLG) and rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTLG), for example, subject to perpendicular electric displacement fields, display a rich confluence of competing orders, resulting in a valley-degenerate, spin-polarized half-metal at moderate doping, and a spin- and valley-polarized (non-degenerate) quarter-metal at lower doping. Here we show that such a quarter-metal can be susceptible toward the nucleation of a unique spin- and valley-polarized superconducting ground state, accommodating \emph{odd-parity} (dominantly $p$ wave in BBLG and $f$ wave in RTLG) inter-layer Cooper pairs that break the translational symmetry, giving rise to a Kekulé (in BBLG) or columnar (in RTLG) pair density wave. Due to the trigonal warping in the normal state, the superconducting ground state produces three-fold rotationally symmetric isolated Fermi rings of normal fermions, which can manifest via linear in temperature scaling of the specific heat. We present scaling of the zero-temperature pairing amplitude and the transition temperature of such pair density wave in the presence of trigonally warped disconnected, annular, and simply connected Fermi rings in the normal state, subject to an effective attractive interaction within a mean-field approximation.</p>

            <h2>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongjin Kim, Cedric Lim, Kirill Matirko, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Michael O. Flynn</p>
            <p>We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.</p>

            <h2>Symmetries, Conservation Laws and Entanglement in Non-Hermitian Fermionic Lattices</h2>

            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.</p>

            <p>We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p>We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Bifurcations in Quantum Circuit Stability from Hidden Parameter Statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pilsung Kang</p>
            <p>The compression of quantum circuits is a foundational challenge for near-term quantum computing, yet the principles governing circuit stability remain poorly understood. We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits. Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of ``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.</p>

            <p>In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.</p>

            <p>We explore a class of dynamical protocols - that we term loop quenches - which are tailored for the study of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) systems. In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus evading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium topology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we introduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes the equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for chiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe measurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our protocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most importantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be extended to other symmetry classes and dimensions.</p>

By employing a coupled set of Gross-Pitaevskii equations with adiabatic elimination of excited states, we demonstrate field-induced tuning of Josephson frequencies and a transition from contact to dipole-dominated regimes.

Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron quasiparticles.

            <p>Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigated the quasiparticle and spin dynamics in single crystals of bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset temperatures at $\sim$140 K and $\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\rm SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical control.</p>

It is an unconventional phase of matter characterized by a d-wave (or higher even-parity-wave) collinear compensated spin ordering, which enables strongly spin-polarized currents in the absence of magnetization, and features fast spin dynamics. Simultaneously, on the applied magnetism front, spintronic memories based on conventional ferromagnets are currently turning from a niche to a mass produced integrated-circuit technology as they start to complement semiconductors on advanced-node microprocessor chips. Our review connects these two rapidly developing science and technology fields by discussing how the unique signatures of altermagnetism can impact the functionality and scalability of future spintronic devices. As a reference, we first briefly recall the merits and physical limitations of the present ferromagnetic spintronic technology, and of proof-of-concept spintronic devices based on conventional collinear antiferromagnets and non-collinear compensated magnets. The main part of the review then focuses on physical concepts of the altermagnetic spintronics, and its potential interplay with ferroelectricity or superconductivity.

            <p>The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.</p>

            <p>We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing Topological Phase Transition in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> ZhaoXiang Fang, Yongxu Fu, Guang-Can Guo, Long Xiong</p>
            <p>We propose and present a concept of Topological Distance (TD), obtained from the integration of trace distance over the generalized Brillouin zone, in order to characterize the topological transitions of non-Hermitian systems. Specifically, such a quantity is used to measure the overall dissimilarity between eigen wavefunctions upon traversing all possible matter states, and confirms the phase boundaries through observing the divergences of both TD and its partial derivatives; we clarify its origin and also offer a theoretical explanation. The method is developed to characterize the non-Hermitian topology in a novel way, and shows its generality and effectiveness in 1D non-Hermitian Kitaev systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians under periodic or open boundary conditions, and even generalizable to higher-order topological systems, providing a novel perspective to understand topological physics.</p>

            <h2>Spin ladder quantum simulators from spin-orbit-coupled quantum dot spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of distinct relaxation behaviour and Quantum Regression Theorem in the Ultra-strong Coupling Limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sakil Khan, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla</p>
            <p>In the framework of open quantum systems, we derive the dynamical equation governing two-time correlation functions in the ultra-strong coupling (USC) regime between the system and its environment. Unlike the case of the standard weak-coupling regime, in the USC case, we find distinct relaxation behavior for two-time correlators depending on the types of the operators involved in the correlation function. Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT) emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the system-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative spin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method.</p>

            <h2>Spin-orbit-enabled realization of arbitrary two-qubit gates on moving spins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Fernández-Fernández, Y. Matsumoto, L.M.K. Vandersypen, G. Platero, S. Bosco</p>
            <p>Shuttling spin qubits in systems with large spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can cause errors during motion. However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can be harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We consider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are smoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary high-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and waiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially, performing 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization of a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented using static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct implementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing control overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <h2>Emergent gauge flux in QED$_3$ with flavor chemical potential: application to magnetized U(1) Dirac spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Chen, Urban F. P. Seifert, Kexin Feng, Oleg A. Starykh, Leon Balents, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>We design a lattice model of non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Emergent dynamical Kondo coherence and competing magnetic order in a correlated kagome flat-band metal CsCr6Sb6</h2>

            <p>Correlated kagome metals host unique electronic states that enable exotic quantum phenomena. In the recently emerged CsCr6Sb6, these manifest through Kondo behavior from localized Cr-3d electrons and unprecedented band flattening near the Fermi level. Yet the intricate interplay among Kondo screening, magnetic frustration, and electronic correlations remains poorly understood-a fundamental gap we address through multifaceted experimental and theoretical approaches. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal electronic correlation-renormalized flat bands and muon spin relaxation study detect short-range magnetic order at TN ~ 80 K. Complementing these findings, density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations identify a coherent-incoherent crossover at TN, with a remarkable restoration of coherence accompanying local moment suppression-an anomalous hallmark of Kondo behavior. Intriguingly, despite strong interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling, the system evades long-range magnetic order due to competing magnetic configurations separated by sub-meV energy differences. These insights establish CsCr6Sb6 as a prototypical platform for investigating dynamical Kondo screening in correlated flat-band systems, opening new avenues to study flat band physics and frustrated magnetism in correlated kagome lattices.</p>

            <p>Topological quasiparticles, arising when the chemical potential is near the band crossing, are pivotal for the development of next-generation quantum devices. They are expected to exist in half-Heusler correlated topological semimetals. However, the emergence of hole carriers, which alter the chemical potential away from the quadratic-band-touching points is not yet understood. Here, we investigated the electronic structure of YPtBi and GdPtBi through ab initio many-body perturbation GW theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory and revealed that the correlation effects of 4$d$ or 4$f$ electrons can lead to the formation of hole carriers. In YPtBi, the weakly correlated Y-4$d$ electrons constitute the topological bands, and the quadratic-band-touching point is at the Fermi level at high temperatures. At low temperatures, enhanced correlations of Y-4$d$ renormalize the topological bands, leading to the formation of hole pocket. In GdPtBi, the strongly correlated Gd-4$f$ electrons form the Hubbard-like bands originate from self-energy effects associated with a topological singularity. These local bands encompass itinerant 4$f$ bands, which hybridize with topological bands to induce pronounced hole bands. This concerted effect reduces the hole doping, bringing the chemical potential closer to the quadratic-band-touching points as the temperature is lowered. The temperature-induced Lifshitz transition should be responsible for the large hole bands observed in both topological semimetals in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements at low temperatures. Our findings indicate that the integration of correlated fermions within a topological framework can modulate the energy landscape of topological bands.</p>

            <h2>Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in a Honeycomb Spiral Spin-Liquid Candidate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqian Zhao, Xun Chen, Zongtang Wan, Zhaohua Ma, Yuesheng Li</p>
            <p>Unlike conventional magnetic states, which lack degeneracy, the spiral spin liquid (SSL) fluctuates among degenerate spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized ferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and decalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic cooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the magnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a spin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $<$ $H_\mathrm{c}$ ($\mu_0H_\mathrm{c}$ $\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\sim$2 K). For $H$ $\geq$ $H_\mathrm{c}$, GdZnPO enters a polarized non-degenerate ferromagnetic state. Our results demonstrate that GdZnPO exhibits a giant low-temperature magnetocaloric effect near $H_\mathrm{c}$, surpassing other magnetocaloric materials. This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated honeycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below $H_\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures. Additionally, its magnetic cooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\sim$36 mK through cycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures, constructed by stacking two-dimensional materials, have enabled the study of interlayer coupling between different materials. One example is the formation of interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. The integration of 2D sliding ferroelectric materials introduces new opportunities for manipulating excitonic properties in these systems. In this work, we investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body calculations. Photoluminescence spectroscopy at low temperature reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric environment changes. Additionally, local variations in photoluminescence energy correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton behavior. Gate voltage experiments further demonstrate tunable shifts in interlayer exciton energy, driven by switching ferroelectric domains. These results highlight the potential of interlayer excitons being controlled by local ferroelectric polarization and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We report quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance that are periodic in magnetic field ($B$), observed at the interface between (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. Unlike Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ > 7$ T and diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The relatively long phase coherence length ($\sim$ 1.8 $\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic interferometers and quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling orbital optical chirality through multipolar chiral light-matter interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shun Hashiyada, An'an Wu, Yoshito Y. Tanaka</p>
            <p>Chiral light-matter interactions have traditionally been understood in terms of electric-magnetic dipolar interference driven by light with spin angular momentum. Here, we show that optical chirality can also originate from the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, giving rise to higher-order multipolar chiral responses. Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused circularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular momenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral dichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes, revealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM. The spectra reveal clear quadrupole resonances whose spectral profile is strongly modulated by the OAM sign, demonstrating an OAM-driven chiral interaction. Crucially, the signal satisfies optical reciprocity, ruling out artefacts from anisotropy or misalignment and confirming its nature as a true chiral response. Angular momentum dissipation analysis further shows that orbital contributions dominate over spin. These findings establish the existence of a distinct form of optical chirality, referred to as orbital optical chirality, which opens new avenues for probing and controlling multipolar chiral light-matter interactions beyond the dipolar paradigm.</p>

            <p>Topological band theory has expanded into various domains in applied physics, offering significant potential for future technologies. Recent developments indicate that unique bulk band topology perceived for electrons can be realized in a system of light-matter quasiparticles with reduced crystal symmetry utilizing tunable light-matter interaction. In this work we realize topologically non-trivial energy band dispersion of exciton-polaritons confined in two-dimensional anisotropic materials inside an optical microcavity, and show the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) due to non-Hermitian topology arising from excitonic dipole oscillators with finite quasiparticle lifetime. Fourier-plane imaging reveals two pairs of EPs connected by bulk Fermi arcs for each of the transverse electric and magnetic polarized modes. An anisotropic Lorentz oscillator model captures the exact band dispersion observed in our experiment in two-dimensional momentum space. Our findings establish anisotropic two-dimensional materials as a platform for exploring non-Hermitian topological physics, with implications for polarization-controlled optical technologies.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.</p>

            <p>Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.</p>

Using error-controlled Green function Monte Carlo, here we investigate a square lattice spin-1 model that shows precise signatures of a fracton quantum spin liquid without indications of conventional ordering. Specifically, the magnetic response exhibits characteristic patterns of suppressed pinch points that accurately match the prediction of a rank-2 U(1) field theory and reveals the existence of emergent photon excitations in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Remarkably, this type of fracton quantum spin liquid is not only identified in the system's ground state but also in generic low-energy sectors of a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes. Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are a novel class of materials that combine antiferromagnetic spin ordering with non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in their band structure, making them promising candidates for spintronics applications without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional bilayer Mott insulator that exhibits altermagnetic order. The interplay between spin and layer degrees of freedom gives rise to a complex symmetry-breaking pattern involving both magnetic and interlayer-coherent components. A key control parameter in the system is the layer polarization, which can be tuned via an external gate voltage. We show that applying an in-plane electric field with opposite signs in the two layers induces a polarization current that drives a spin current in each layer. While the polarization current is isotropic, the resulting spin current exhibits strong anisotropy and can be reversed by adjusting the photon energy. These findings suggest new avenues for manipulating spin transport in altermagnetic systems via electric and optical means.</p>

            <h2>Coulombic control of charge transfer in luminescent radicals with long-lived quartet states</h2>

            <p>Excitons in organic materials are emerging as an attractive platform for tunable quantum technologies. Structures with near-degenerate doublet and triplet excitations in linked trityl radical, acene and carbazole units can host quartet states. These high spin states can be coherently manipulated, and later decay radiatively via the radical doublet transition. However, this requires controlling the deexcitation pathways of all metastable states. Here we establish design rules for efficient quartet generation in luminescent radicals, using different connection arrangements of the molecular units. We discover that electronic coupling strength between these units dictates luminescence and quartet formation yields, particularly through the energetics of an acene-radical charge transfer state, which we tune Coulombically. This state acts as a source of non-radiative decay when acene-radical separation is small, but facilitates doublet-quartet spin interconversion when acene-radical separation is large. Using these rules we report a radical-carbazole-acene material with 55% luminescence yield, where 94% of emitting excitons originate from the quartet at microsecond times. This reveals the central role of molecular topology in luminescent quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngjae Kim</p>
            <p>The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</p>

            <h2>Observation of gapless collective charge fluctuations in an Anderson insulating state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jong Mok Ok, Beom Jun Park, Junik Hwang, Seonghoon Park, Myeongjun Kang, Jun Sung Kim, Ki-Seok Kim, Seung-Ho Baek</p>
            <p>Understanding the nature of collective charge dynamics in the Coulomb gap phase is essential for revealing the existence of many-body localization. However, the corresponding many-particle excitation spectra remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of $^{27}$Al and $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (NMR/NQR), along with specific heat ($C_p$) measurements, in the $p$-type semiconductor CuAlO$_2$. Our study unveils distinct changes in charge dynamics at two crossover temperature scales which separate three regimes associated with Anderson localization of charge carriers: thermally activated transport ($T>150$ K) $\rightarrow$ Mott variable-range hopping (VRH) $\rightarrow$ Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH with Coulomb gap formation ($T<50$ K). In the ES VRH regime, we observe a striking divergence in the zero-field $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, $(T_1T)^{-1}$, which is strongly suppressed by an applied magnetic field, indicative of quantum critical charge fluctuations. This is further supported by a distinct magnetic field-dependence of $C_p/T$ deep within the Coulomb gap phase. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the emergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson insulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Realization of the Topologically Nontrivial Phase in Monolayer Si$_2$Te$_2$</h2>

            <p>The free-standing monolayer Si$_2$Te$_2$ (ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$) has been theoretically predicted to host a room-temperature quantum spin Hall phase. However, its experimental realization remains challenge due to the absence of a three-dimensional counterpart. Here, we demonstrate that HfTe$_2$ serves as an ideal substrate for the epitaxial growth of ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$, preserving its topological phase. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy confirm a strain-free ${(1 \times 1)}$ lattice of ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$, along with a sizable band gap, which is well captured by first-principles calculations. Moreover, distinct edge states, independent of step geometry and exhibiting a broad spatial distribution, are observed at ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$ step edges, underscoring its topological nature.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetric-gate Mach--Zehnder interferometry in graphene: Multi-path conductance oscillations and visibility characteristics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taegeun Song, Nojoon Myoung</p>
            <p>Graphene provides an excellent platform for investigating electron quantum interference due to its outstanding coherent properties. In the quantum Hall regime, Mach--Zehnder (MZ) electronic interferometers are realized using p--n junctions in graphene, where electron interference is highly protected against decoherence. In this work, we present a phenomenological framework for graphene-based MZ interferometry with asymmetric p--n junction configurations. We show that the enclosed interferometer area can be tuned by asymmetric gate potentials, and additional MZ pathways emerge in higher-filling-factor scenarios, e.g. $\left(\nu_{n},\nu_{p}\right)=\left(-3,+3\right)$. The resulting complicated beat oscillations in asymmetric-gate MZ interference are efficiently analyzed using a machine-learning--based Fourier transform, which yields improved peak-to-background ratios compared to conventional signal-processing techniques. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the asymmetric gate on the interference visibility, finding that interference visibility is enhanced under symmetric gate conditions.</p>

            <h2>Supercritical fluids as a distinct state of matter characterized by sub-short-range structural order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sha Jin, Xinyang Li, Xue Fan, Matteo Baggioli, Yuliang Jin</p>
            <p>A supercritical fluid (SCF)--the state of matter at temperatures and pressures above the critical point--exhibits properties intermediate between those of a liquid and a gas. However, whether it constitutes a fundamentally distinct phase or merely a continuous extension of the liquid and gas states remains an open question. Here we show that a SCF is defined by sub-short-range (SSR) structural order in the spatial arrangement of particles, setting it apart from the gas (disordered), liquid (short-range ordered), and solid (long-range ordered) states. The SSR structural order can be characterized by a length scale effectively quantified by the number of observable peaks in the radial distribution function. This length grows from a minimum microscopic value, on the order of the inter-particle distance at the gas-SCF boundary, to a diverging value at the SCF-liquid boundary. Based on the emergence of SSR order, we demonstrate that the transport and dynamical properties of the SCF state, including the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity autocorrelation function, also clearly distinguish it from both the liquid and gas states. Theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics simulations of argon and further supported by existing experimental evidence. Our study confirms and assigns physical significance to the refined phase diagram of matter in the supercritical region, consisting of three distinct states (gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid) separated by two crossover boundaries that follow universal scaling laws.</p>
