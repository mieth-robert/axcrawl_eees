            <h2>Quasiparticle Interference in LiFeAs: Signature of Inelastic Tunneling through Spin Fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shun Chi, Carolina A. Marques, Walter N. Hardy, Ruixing Liang, Pinder Dosanjh, Doug A. Bonn, Sarah A. Burke, Peter Wahl</p>
            <p>Quasi-particle interference (QPI) is a powerful tool to characterize the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in unconventional superconductors, by mapping the spatial dependence of elastic tunneling of electrons between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope and a sample. Here, we consider the influence of inelastic tunneling on quasi-particle interference, exemplarily for the iron-based superconductor LiFeAs. We clearly observe replica features in both experimental QPI maps and the dispersion extracted from QPI, which from comparison with theoretical model calculations can be attributed to inelastic tunneling. Analysis of the QPI dispersion shows that the inelastic mode that gives rise to these replica features exhibits a resonance between 8 and 10 meV. Comparison of the energy scale of the resonance energy estimated from QPI with inelastic neutron scattering indicates that the replica features arise from interaction with spin fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Andreev crystals in hybrid Josephson junction arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anders Enevold Dahl, Andrea Maiani, Max Geier, Javad Shabani, Karsten Flensberg</p>
            <p>Andreev bound states are superpositions of electrons and holes in a metal that form by coherent reflection from a superconductor. When the length of the superconductor is comparable to the superconducting coherence length, Andreev bound states at opposite edges hybridize by quasiparticle tunneling. In a periodic array, these hybridized bound states form a band at energies below the superconducting gap. In this paper, we derive a theoretical framework for the transport properties of these Andreev crystals. We demonstrate that at high interface transparency and constant phase bias between neighboring superconductors, these bands are {\it directional}: one band consists only of right -- while the other only of left-moving electronic states. This property enables the application of this device as a flux- and bias-voltage tunable filter that permits signal transmission in only one direction.</p>

            <h2>Electro-thermal Co-design of High-power Vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky Diodes with High-permittivity Dielectric Field-plate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ahsanul Mohaimeen Audri, Chung-Ping Ho, Jingjing Shi, Esmat Farzana</p>
            <p>This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications.</p>

            <h2>Effect of Magnetic Field on Neutral Bath Containing Charged Brownian Particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jana Tothova, Jan Busa, Vladimir Lisy</p>
            <p>Based on the Zwanzig-Caldeira-Legget theory generalized to systems under the influence of a static magnetic field, we obtain equations of motion for the Brownian particle (BP) and oscillators constituting the bath in which the BP is embedded. The equations are of the type of a generalized Langevin equation, which accounts for the frictional memory of the system. The BP is assumed to be charged while the bath particles are neutral. They thus do not directly respond to the external field, but their interaction with the BP leads to changes in the bath state. Using the solution of the equations found, we calculate the average bath angular momentum and show that it persists for long times when the system is assumed to reach equilibrium. This indicates a possible violation of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem for baths consisting of charged particles. However, this must be confirmed by a substantial generalization of the presented model when the bath particles feel the external field, which affects the memory in the dynamics of the system.</p>

            <h2>Ideal Fermi gas in the Dunkl formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Djamel Eddine Zenkhri, Abdelhakim Benkrane</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas within the framework of the Dunkl formalism, which incorporates deformation effects through reflection symmetric differential operators. The formalism is applied to reformulate the creation and annihilation operators, leading to modified expressions for the fundamental thermodynamic quantities while preserving the underlying Fermi Dirac statistics. We derived modified expressions for the main thermodynamic quantities. In both the non degenerate and degenerate limits, we examined the effects of the Dunkl parameter on the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and heat capacity. Furthermore, we analyzed how the Dunkl deformation influences the isothermal compressibility, the average velocity of particles, and the Pauli paramagnetism.</p>

            <h2>Control of magnetic transition, metal-semiconductor transition, and magnetic anisotropy in noncentrosymmetric monolayer Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rui-Qi Wang, Tengfei Cao, Tian-Min Lei, Xie Zhang, Yue-Wen Fang</p>
            <p>Recent advances in two-dimensional materials have greatly expanded the family of ferromagnetic materials. The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI$_3$, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayers, are characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here we report a Janus ferromagnet, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$ with inversion symmetry breaking, through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal-semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te$_3$ atoms play a key role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from $p_z / p_y$ and $p_x / p_y$ orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by strain or electric field.</p>

            <h2>Mn4Al11: A Half-Semimetal Candidate with Anomalous Electronic Behaviors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shanshan Han, Rongsheng Li, Xingxing Jiang, Ming Lu, Shuxiang Xu, Jiang Zeng, Dong Wu, Nanlin Wang</p>
            <p>Half-semimetals, characterized by their spin-polarized electronic states, hold significant promise for spintronic applications but remain scarce due to stringent electronic and magnetic criteria. Through a combination of transport measurements and optical spectroscopy, we investigated the intermetallic compound Mn4Al11, which features an exceptionally low carrier concentration and undergoes a magnetic phase transition near 68 K. Transport measurements reveal anomalies that deviate from typical metallic behavior at low temperatures. Optical spectroscopy indicates a small, nearly frequency-independent optical conductivity in the far-infrared region, with spectral weight decreasing as the temperature drops from 300 K to 50 K. These behaviors suggest a temperaturedependent carrier density and significant scattering of charge carriers. Combining experimental findings with calculated electronic band structures, we propose that Mn4Al11 is a novel half-semimetal candidate exhibiting a ferrimagnetic ground state.</p>

            <h2>Colloidal hydrodynamic interactions in viscoelastic fluid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dae Yeon Kim, Sachit G. Nagella, Saksham Malik, Nayeon Park, Jaewook Nam, Eric S.G. Shaqfeh, Sho C. Takatori</p>
            <p>The motion of suspended colloidal particles generates fluid disturbances in the surrounding medium that create interparticle interactions. While such colloidal hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) have been extensively studied in viscous Newtonian media, comprehensive understanding of HIs in viscoelastic fluids is lacking. We develop a framework to quantify HIs in viscoelastic fluids with high spatiotemporal precision by trapping colloids and inducing translation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling. Using solutions of wormlike micelles (WLMs) as a case study, we discover that HIs are strongly time-dependent and depend on the structural memory generated in the viscoelastic fluid, in contrast to "instantaneous" HIs in viscous Newtonian fluids. We directly measure time-dependent HIs between a stationary probe and a driven particle during transient start-up, developing on the WLM relaxation timescale. Following the sudden cessation of the driven particle, we observe an intriguing flow reversal in the opposing direction, lasting for a time about ten times larger than the WLM relaxation time. We corroborate our observations with analytical microhydrodynamic theory, direct numerical solutions of a continuum model, and particle-based Stokesian dynamics simulations. We find that the structural recovery of the WLMs from a nonlinear strain can generate anisotropic and heterogeneous stresses that produce flow reversals and hydrodynamic attraction among colloids. Measured heterogeneities indicate a breakdown of standard continuum models for constitutive relations when the size of colloids is comparable to the length scales of the polymeric constituents and their entanglement lengths.</p>

            <h2>Stable crack propagation in dislocation-engineered oxide visualized by double cleavage drilled compression test</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oliver Preuß, Zhangtao Li, Enrico Bruder, Philippe Carrez, Yinan Cui, Jürgen Rödel, Xufei Fang</p>
            <p>Understanding crack tip - dislocation interaction is critical for improving the fracture resistance of semi-brittle materials like room-temperature plastically deformable ceramics. Here, we use a modified double cleavage drilled compression (DCDC) specimen geometry, which facilitates stable crack propagation, to achieve in situ observation of crack tip - dislocation interaction. MgO specimens, furnished with dislocation-rich barriers, were employed to study how dislocations influence crack propagation. Crack progression was clearly observed to decelerate within dislocation-rich regions, slowing to 15% of its velocity as compared to the pristine crystal. Upon exiting these regions, cracks reaccelerated until reaching the next dislocation-rich barrier. Coupled phase field and crystal plasticity modeling replicates the experimental observations and provides mechanistic insight into crack tip - dislocation interactions. The aligned experiment and simulation results underscore the robustness of the technique and its potential to inform the design of more fracture-resistant ceramics via dislocations.</p>

            <h2>Off-Diagonal dipolar interactions in the mixed Ising--XY magnet $LiHo_{x}Er_{1-x}F_4$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomer Dollberg, Moshe Schechter</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the influence of off-diagonal dipolar interactions in the mixed-anisotropy magnet $LiHo_{x}Er_{1-x}F_4$. Motivated by experimental observations showing an unexpectedly rapid suppression of the ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_c$ upon substitution of Ho by Er ions, we use Monte Carlo simulations incorporating off-diagonal dipolar terms to elucidate the underlying physical mechanism. Our results reveal that, unlike in the diluted magnet $LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_4$, where dilution weakens the effect of these interactions, substitution by planar Er ions amplifies it. This leads to a pronounced reduction of $T_c$, closely matching experimental data, thereby resolving discrepancies with mean-field predictions. The findings underscore the essential role of off-diagonal dipolar interactions in determining the magnetic properties of mixed-anisotropy dipolar systems.</p>

            <h2>Domain Wall-mediated Interfacial Ferroelectric Switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Wen Xu, Wen-Cheng Fan, Jun-Ding Zheng, Cheng-Shi Yao, Ni Zhong, Wen-Yi Tong, Chun-Gang Duan</p>
            <p>Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast, low-power memory devices. While previous studies have attributed polarization switching to full-layer sliding, the symmetry constraints pose fundamental limitations. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls within in-plane polarization break C3 symmetry, enabling polarization switching under out-of-plane electric fields. Local polarization vectors deviate to response to the field, leading to local reconstruction, and ultimately drives the migration of domain walls. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, successfully realized by our experiments. These insights clarify the microscopic switching mechanism in hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, providing a basis for future nanoelectronics applications.</p>

            <h2>Voltage-tunable field-free Josephson diode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sjoerd Telkamp, Junting Zhao, Saulius Vaitiekėnas</p>
            <p>We report a gate-tunable Josephson diode effect in hybrid nanowire junctions consisting of a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor core coated with epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator and superconductor shells. The wires display a hysteretic superconducting window as a function of axial magnetic field. In the superconducting regime, the devices exhibit nonreciprocal supercurrent transport, with the diode efficiency showing a strong dependence on back-gate voltage. The effect persists in a remanent magnetization state following a controlled demagnetization procedure, establishing zero-field operation. These findings demonstrate a voltage-controlled Josephson diode in a single junction and suggest a route toward probing intrinsically broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries in hybrid materials.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Behaviors in Active Model B+ via the Functional Renormalization Group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gergely Fejős, Zsolt Szép, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>We study the scaling behaviors of the Active Model B+ using the functional renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$ dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the RG flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those obtained in its perturbative counterpart.</p>

            <h2>High-root topological edge-state bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. G. Dias, L. Madail, A. M. Marques</p>
            <p>This paper presents a complex band analysis of one-dimensional (1D) square and high-root topological insulators (HRTIs). We show that edge-state bands of HRTIs are sliced sections of impurity bands of a uniform tight-binding chain. A simplified topological characterization of HRTIs with generalized boundary conditions is carried out based on the existence of edge-state bands in the infinite HRTI and the restrictions imposed by the boundary conditions. Edge states in finite or semi-infinite 1D HRTIs are shown to be a subset of evanescent states of the infinite system and mapped onto impurity states of the uniform chain with effective energy-dependent edge potentials. The latter result allows the determination of the edge state levels without needing the diagonalization of real space or bulk Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>We simulate collectively interacting skyrmions in a channel with periodic asymmetry, and find a strong diode effect for the skyrmion flow. There is also an asymmetry in the skyrmion annihilation rate for currents applied along the hard or easy substrate asymmetry direction, with a higher annihilation rate for hard direction currents. We map out the diode efficiency as a function of magnetic field and substrate asymmetry angle. We also show that the Magnus force impacts the diode motion and annihilation rate asymmetry by forcing skyrmions into corners of the protrusion geometry.</p>

            <h2>Strong overlap of deterministic and stochastic dynamics in a super-diffusive regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Tayyab, Jahanzeb Tariq</p>
            <p>We consider deterministic dynamics, known as the slicer map (SM), which exhibits normal and anomalous diffusion by varying a single parameter. The statistics of the position moments and the low-order position autocorrelation function (PACF) of the SM closely overlap with those of a stochastic process called the Lévy-Lorentz gas (LLg), particularly in the normal and strongly superdiffusive anomalous regimes. However, matching low-order statistics alone cannot fully characterize the microscopic dynamics or distinguish underlying process classes. To demonstrate how these dynamics strongly overlap, we focus on the scaling of higher-order PACF, which provides a more detailed characterization. In this paper, we analytically derive the generalized PACF of the SM and explore its scaling forms under different temporal relationships. Specifically, we derive several scalings of the 3-point PACF by analyzing intriguing relations between three times. We compare these scalings with the power-law tails of the numerically estimated 3-point PACF of the LLg. This comparison provides a detailed description of the correlation scalings of the SM, demonstrating that the SM shares key features with the LLg. Our findings establish the SM as a deterministic analog of the LLg, enabling efficient prediction of multi-time position correlations in superdiffusive systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantized nonlinear kink movement through topological boundary state instabilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Bestler, Oded Zilberberg</p>
            <p>Thouless pumping is a paradigmatic example of topologically protected, directed transport in linear systems. Recent extensions to nonlinear pumps often overlook the need to reassess the conventional framework of linear topology. In this work, we study a nonlinear dimer-chain model that exhibits quantized transport of kinks under a periodic modulation of a pumping parameter. Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model and display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods from nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are the driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport resembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by conventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a topological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally nonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we demonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton motion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify concepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework for quantized transport in nonlinear media.</p>

            <p>Ovonic threshold switching is the key process for several applications of chalcogenide alloys including phase change memories and selector elements in cross-points arrays. Very recently, it has been shown that the threshold switching voltage VT depends on the polarity of the applied field. This feature has been already exploited in the realization of the Single Chalcogenide X-point Memory (SXM) in which a single film of a chalcogenide alloy can serve as both a memory and selector unit. In this work, we provide a microscopic understanding of the polarity-dependent VT by leveraging electrical and physical measurements, numerical simulations based on technology computer aided design (TCAD) and electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We developed a Graded Band Gap (GBG) model in which an inhomogeneous distribution of localized electronic states in the gap is established by the opposite effect of a strong electric field at the cathode and a high density of electrons in the conduction band at the anode. The model is suitable to reproduce several features of the programming window, including its dependence on temperature, thickness and composition of the chalcogenide alloy. The microscopic understanding that we gained on the SXM operation lays the foundation for important improvements in the memory design and in the selection of better performing alloys for applications in enabling memory technologies.</p>

            <p>Optical imaging plays an instrumental role in understanding the behavior of trapped neutral atoms. In this work, we describe a deep learning-based online image completion protocol that reduces interference fringes in optical absorption signals for a dual-species atomic system. Regardless of the distinct nature of the task for two different atomic species, 6Li and 23Na, the method displays a robust solution for suppressing fringes. To incorporate this into daily operations, a transfer learning scheme is required that incrementally updates the previously learned parameters. We outline an online image completion method that efficiently adapts to drifting experimental conditions. Our method can be easily integrated into lab settings, where transfer learning can accelerate image analysis.</p>

In the photoexcited state, spin-orbit splitting of the conduction band cannot be resolved. This sets the upper bound of photoinduced Rashba coupling to $\alpha_C<2.5$ eVÅ.

            <h2>Comparative study of magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO from first principles</h2>

            <p>Spin-wave excitations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of magnetic materials and hold promise for future information and communication technologies. Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT) with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy differences using the four-state mapping ($\Delta E$), and the other via the magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the Heisenberg model based on $\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and design of magnetic materials.</p>

Furthermore, we develop an analytical approach that accurately describes the behavior of the discovered superlattice plasmon mode, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic metasurface systems.</p>

            <h2>Bridging Molecular Simulation and Process Modeling for Predictive Multicomponent Adsorption</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunghyun Yoon, Jui Tu, Li-Chiang Lin, Yongchul G. Chung</p>
            <p>Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enable high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges.</p>

            <h2>Steering chiral active Brownian motion via stochastic position-orientation resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Shee</p>
            <p>Guiding active motion is important for targeted delivery, sensing, and search tasks. Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical, physical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport efficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome these limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by interrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are infrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared displacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state excess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state diagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two resetting-dominated states with and without chirality; in contrast, the achiral counterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state. Chirality thus enriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between transport modes absent in achiral systems. A simple reset protocol can thus transform chiral active dynamics and offer a practical strategy for optimizing search and transport in circle swimmers.</p>

            <p>Understanding nonequilibrium electron-phonon interactions at the microscopic level and on ultrafast timescales is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. The present study advances our understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over relaxation pathways in driven solids.</p>

            <h2>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enhanced by Synergetic Interactions among Photon Phonon and Molecule</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Sun, Yimin Xuan</p>
            <p>Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate. The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation. Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2 stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter coupling.</p>

            <h2>Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing-Sui Lu</p>
            <p>We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanwen Liao, Yongfeng Huang, Kun Wang, Wenjun Zhu, Wu-Xing Zhou, Yi Liao, Songlin Yao</p>
            <p>An angular-dependent potential for the U-Nb system is developed based on an existing ADP for U and a new EAM potential for Nb through fitting flexible cross-interaction functions and alloy parameters to experimental and first-principles data, enabling accurate prediction of phase transitions (alpha to gamma driven by solute concentration; alpha-prime to gamma under temperature in U-6Nb alloy), elastic properties, defect energetics, and mixed enthalpy. The potential reliably reproduces melting points of U-Nb solid solutions and captures lattice parameter expansion of gamma U-6Nb. Notably, it correctly predicts Hugoniot relations and equations of state up to about 90 GPa and resolves the alpha-prime to gamma transition under static high pressure. Combined with atomic simulations, we reveal a twinning-coupled alpha-prime to gamma transition of U-6Nb under high pressures: {112}gamma twins form via nanosecond-scale twinning precursors generated during the transient adiabatic compressions. The static phase transition pressure is predicted to be 54.5 GPa, comparable to 67.2 GPa by first-principles calculations. Besides, our result suggests that U-6Nb single-crystal would experience a nonlinear elastic relaxation before yielding plastically at 3.1 GPa (shear stress: 0.9 GPa). The results in this work help resolve long-standing discrepancies in understanding the abnormal shear stress relaxation mechanisms under high-pressure shock loading.</p>

            <p>We identify topological dissipation -- momentum transport along the polymer backbone with Ising-type exponential decay ($\sim \exp(-\Delta n/n_\text{d})$) -- as the missing link connecting atomistic and mesoscale dynamics. Simulations of four polymers reveal that dynamical correlation length $n_\text{d} \approx n_\text{k}/3$ (Kuhn length $n_\text{k}$), enabling a coarse-grained framework that \emph{explicitly separates} topological (intrachain) and spatial (interchain) dissipation channels without temporal memory kernels. The approach quantitatively reproduces dynamics from segmental relaxation to chain diffusion, solving the long-standing memory preservation challenge in Markovian coarse-graining. Our results establish topology-mediated dissipation as a key mechanism for polymer dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Non-Hermitian Chiral Superfluids with a Complex Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Hang Ji, Wenxing Nie</p>
            <p>Recently, the influence of dissipation on a quantum system has attracted much attention, particularly on how the non-Hermitian terms modify the energy spectrum, band topology, and phase transition point. Motivated by the recent investigation of non-Hermitian $s$-wave superfluidity, we study the non-Hermitian chiral $p+ip$ superfluid (SF) with a complex-valued interaction, originating from inelastic scattering between fermions. We reformulate the non-Hermitian mean-field theory for chiral SFs and derive the gap equation in the path integral approach. By numerically solving the gap equation, we obtain the phase diagram of the non-Hermitian $p+ip$ SF, characterized by the reentrant SF transition and dissipation-induced SF phase, as a result of the evolution of the exceptional lines. The method can be extended to higher partial-wave chiral SFs, such as $d+id$ and $f+if$-wave SFs. We further consider such a chiral $p+ip$ SF on a square lattice, to investigate the influence of dissipation on topology. We find that the non-Hermitian skin effect is absent in the specific cylinder geometry, in which the topology associated with the edge modes and Chern number is robust to dissipation. Besides, we find that the energies at the robust point nodes and line nodes are pure real. We further verify the conditions of zero winding number in (quasi-) one-dimensional systems, and prove an associated ``no-go'' theorem, which is hopefully applied to explore the geometry dependent skin effect.</p>

Kotov</p>
            <p>Chiral quantum magnets with spin-states separated by a large energy gap are technologically attractive but difficult to realize. Geometrically frustrated topological states with nanoscale chirality may offer a chemical pathway to such materials. However, room temperature spin misalignment, weakness of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and high energy requirements for lattice distortions set high physicochemical barriers for their realization. Here, we show that layered iron oxyhydroxides (LIOX) address these challenges due to chirality transfer from surface ligands into spin-states of dimerized FeO6 octahedra with zig-zag stacking. The intercalation of chiral amino acids induces angular displacements in the antiferromagnetic spin pairs with a helical coupling of magnetic moments along the screw axis of the zig-zag chains, or helical spin-ladders. Unlike other chiral magnets, the spin states in LIOX are chemically and optically accessible, they display strong optical resonances with helicity-matching photons and enable spin-selective charge transport. The static rather than dynamic polarization of spin ladders in LIOX makes them particularly suitable for catalysis. Room-temperature spin pairing, field-tunability, environmental robustness, and synthetic simplicity make LIOX and its intercalates a uniquely practical family of quantum magnets.</p>

            <p>An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.</p>

In this work, we show the possibility that hole doping can give rise to an anyon superconductor and propose that both spinons and holons form integer quantum Hall states with opposite chiralities. Using topological field theory we demonstrate that the phase is a topological charge-$4e$ superconductor with chiral central charge $c_-=4$. We further identify the deconfined excitations and anyonic excitations bound to the vortex. This unusual superconductor may be realized in moir'e bilayer and detected through quantized thermal Hall effect and spin quantum Hall effect.</p>

Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field indicate ferromagnetic nature with a saturation magnetization of 0.681 mB/f.u. at 5 K. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows a nearly linear decrease in the high-temperature range, indicating the spin gapless semiconductor like behavior of the material. This SGS nature is further supported by the temperature-independent carrier concentration and mobility. Hall effect analysis reveals that the anomalous Hall effect in CoRuTiGe arises from both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Additionally, a well-defined symmetric negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures. These findings suggest that CoRuTiGe holds significant promise for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Itinerant antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal symmetry have recently attracted attention, since their spin-split bands enable large magnetotransport responses comparable to ferromagnets despite the negligible spontaneous magnetisation. When the inversion symmetry is further broken by the antiferromagnetic order, the emerging odd-parity multipole order renders the bands spin-degenerate but asymmetric in the momentum space. For such parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnets, it has been predicted that electronic nematicity is induced by current, allowing unconventional nonlinear transport phenomena. However, their experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we report nonreciprocal angular magnetoresistance in the layered Dirac material SrMnBi$_2$ with parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic order in its Mn-Bi layers. By quantitatively modelling the angular and field dependencies using a phenomenological framework, we reveal that the observed nonreciprocal interlayer resistivity arises from the broken four-fold symmetry of the Dirac valleys in the Bi square net adjacent to the Mn-Bi layer. Furthermore, we demonstrate the alignment of parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic domains via current-field cooling, achieving electric-magnetic control of the $f$-wave polarity in momentum space. The observed switchable nonreciprocal transport associated with current-induced valley symmetry breaking paves the way for novel antiferromagnetic spintronic and valleytronic applications.</p>

We apply it to graphene/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which exhibits a previously unrecognized dichotomy. Unlike the spin polarization at the Fermi level, which follows the pseudospin, the proximity-induced magnetic moments vary across carbon atoms, defying analytical modeling. To address this, we develop a Random Forest model trained on DFT data and employ Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptors to map the local ($\sim 2\,$nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich magnetic moiré textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic environments and are beyond analytical description.</p>

            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase. Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing. In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation. Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy includes a reflection operation.. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a tri-junction of the SPT phase with the aid of a controlled local defect. In this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our theoretical predictions. Based on the tri-junction implementation, we demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. We further propose feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.</p>

            <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) both undergo profound structural and chemical transformations when compressed. While their individual high-P/T phase diagrams have been mapped in considerable detail, comparatively little attention has been paid to the mixtures in which the two species can couple through oxygen transfer, charge redistribution, and nonadiabatic dissociation pathways. Here we use comprehensive ab initio adiabatic/nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, essentially a diabatic trajectory stitching approach, that chart the evolution of CO-N2O mixtures from van-der-Waals fluids to extended amorphous network solids over the range 0-160 GPa and 300-1500 K. We emphasize on (i) the sequence of gas to molecular crystal to polymerized amorphous solid reactive transitions that arise from an interplay between thermal and compression effects in metastable C-N-O mixtures, (ii) the role of N2O unimolecular dissociation in lowering the onset pressure for CO polymerization, and (iii) the emergence of nonadiabatic pathways, via thermal unimolecular dissociation of N2O, accompanied by spin-transition in oxygen atoms that can make C-N-O systems deviate from Born-Oppenheimer dynamics. This dominates the chemistry once the mixture enters the regime of bond-breaking temperatures (T>900 K).</p>

            <p>Achieving operating conditions comparable to ``bulk'' electronic devices, such as thin film capacitors, during \textit{operando} electron microscopy remains challenging, particularly when devices are grown on non-conductive substrates. Limited precision of focused ion beam milling for sample preparation often necessitates the use of conductive substrates or artificially thick layers that differ from actual device architectures. These modifications can alter native strain, electrostatic boundary conditions, and ultimately device response. Here, we present a generic and versatile workflow for \textit{operando} biasing of thin-film capacitors in the (scanning) transmission electron microscope, including sample fabrication and device operation. By introducing a patterned insulating barrier adjacent to the bulk-characterized capacitors, our approach enables sample preparation without altering the original film structure. As a case study, we apply the method to a piezoelectric thin-film capacitor grown on an insulating substrate, and demonstrate that it preserves the boundary-condition-sensitive domain switching at the atomic scale under applied electric fields. Overall, the process can help to establish a foundation for systematic \textit{operando} studies of complex thin-film systems under representative bulk testing geometries.</p>

By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors.</p>

            <p>Topologically protected surface states have garnered significant attention due to their robustness against perturbations and potential applications in optoelectronics. Bi2 Bi2Se3 is a topological semimetal composed of a 2D bismuthene sheet and a Bi2Se3 quintuple layer, forming an intrinsic superlattice. This study investigates the electronic structure and edge states of Bi2 Bi2Se3 [001] oriented films under ambient conditions through conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). Point I-V spectroscopy and current imaging are used to characterize the surface and local transport properties of bismuthene and Bi2Se3 terminated layers. Our measurements reveal force dependent shifts in conduction mechanisms in both bismuthene and Bi2Se3, transitioning from direct tunneling (DT) at low forces and low biases, to Fowler Nordheim tunneling (FNT) at low forces and high biases, and eventually to a more ohmic like behavior at the highest forces. Under DT conditions on the bismuthene termination, we observed the Dirac cone in the dI/dV spectroscopy. Edge states are observed along the perimeter of the (001) terraces for both terminations, and are observed to have higher conductivity than the local terrace. Force-dependent imaging revealed an increase in the width of the edge state as force increased, until the conductive edge state appeared to cover the entire terrace. Furthermore, terrace heights display a force dependent distortion from the high tip forces, which indicates that the transition to the ohmic-like contact regime on either termination results from a complex interplay between strain and tip induced effects. All measurements were performed under ambient conditions, which demonstrates the robustness of the topological and edge states to ambient conditions.</p>

            <h2>Understanding high photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 high-pressure columbite phase by experiments and first-principles calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacqueline Hidalgo-Jimenez, Taner Akbay, Tatsumi Ishihara, Kaveh Edalati</p>
            <p>The clean production of hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel can be done using photocatalysis, with TiO2 being one of the most promising photocatalysts. However, the activity of TiO2 anatase and rutile phases is still limited. In this study, an oxygen-deficient high-pressure phase of TiO2, columbite, is stabilized by a high-pressure torsion method. The phase is utilized as an active photocatalyst for hydrogen production, and the mechanism of its high activity is examined using density functional theory (DFT). The activity of columbite appears to be experimentally higher than that of the anatase phase. DFT calculations revealed that columbite does not have a narrow electronic bandgap, but its optical bandgap and light absorbance are improved by oxygen vacancies more significantly compared to anatase. Moreover, the water adsorption energy is higher and the surface activation energy for water splitting on the (101) atomic plane of columbite is lower than that for the active planes of anatase. In conclusion, although columbite is not a low-bandgap semiconductor, its large light absorbance and high surface catalytic activity make it a promising candidate for photocatalytic reactions.</p>

            <p>An analytically solvable cell fluid model with unrestricted cell occupancy, infinite-range Curie-Weiss-type attraction and short-range intra-cell repulsion is studied within the grand-canonical ensemble. Building on an exact single-integral representation of the grand partition function, we apply Laplace's method to obtain asymptotically exact expressions for the pressure, density and equation of state. The model exhibits a hierarchy of first-order transitions, each terminating at a critical point. We determine the coordinates of the first five such points. Recasting the formalism in dimensionless variables highlights the explicit temperature dependence of all thermodynamic functions. This enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the entropy. The results reveal pronounced entropy minima around integer cell occupancies and reproduce density-anomaly isotherm crossings analogous to those in core-softened models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mizuki Tago, Tsukasa Kurachi, Takayuki Makino</p>
            <p>To realize the significant potential of optical materials such as strongly electron-correlated open-shell rare-earth monoxides, understanding the electron-localization Hubbard parameters ($U$) is of central importance. The Hubbard energy is believed to be material specific and constant. However, it has recently been pointed out that even subtle structural changes can induce changes in $U$ parameters. For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation. Given the typical detection sensitivity of differential spectroscopy ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-4}$), even a few meV modulations in $U$ are sufficient for a detectable spectral response.</p>

            <p>Cr-doped ZnO films were fabricated by a new but feasible method, that is, annealing Cr-Zn layers deposited via DC magnetron sputtering in air. Microstructures of the films were investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, intrinsic point defects were identified via photoluminescence spectroscopy, and optical and dielectric properties were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and dielectric spectrometer, respectively. It was found that the average grain sizes decrease (56.34 - 39.50 nm), the band gap increases (from 3.18 to 3.23 eV), and the transmittance (at 600 nm) decreases (from 91% to 83%) with increasing Cr. Two activation energies of conduction increase after doping Cr, indicating enhanced temperature stability. At optimal Cr levels, ZnO films exhibit high transmittance and conductivity, exhibiting potential for transparent electrode development. This method can be extended to other doped ZnO films, such as Al-doped ZnO transparent electrodes, to achieve simultaneous improvements in transmittance, conductivity, and stability for flexible and wearable applications.</p>

            <p>The gapless chiral hinge states of three dimensional second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) support a quantized conductance plateau on thick nanowire. Here, we numerical study the conductance of SOTI constrictions. According to finite size effects, the hinge states in narrow region could be hybridized, which will induce reflection at the two ends of constrictions. The conductance exists the Fabry-Perot oscillation pattern because of multiple reflections. We also study the impact of the magnetic field on the Fabry-Perot interference. We show the dimensional effect that the magnetic field leads to the electrons being localized on two hinges. Our results are robust against moderate disorder so that we expect these Fabry-Perot patterns could be observed in experiments.</p>

            <p>The nonmagnetic kagome metal ScV6Sn6 displays an unconventional charge order (CO) accompanied by signatures of an anomalous Hall effect, hidden magnetism, and multiple lattice instabilities. In this study, we report the observation of unconventional anomalous thermoelectric properties. Notably, unexpected anomalous transverse Nernst signals reach a peak value of ~4 {\mu}V/K near the TCDW ~92 K in ScV6Sn6, and these signals persist in the charge-ordered state as the temperature decreases to 10 K. Furthermore, both thermopower and thermal conductivity exhibit significant changes under magnetic fields, even in the nonmagnetic ground state. These observations strongly suggest the emergence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in ScV6Sn6, as supported by muon spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements. While hidden magnetism represents the most plausible origin, alternative mechanisms involving orbital currents and chiral charge order remain possible.</p>

            <p>Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges have garnered increasing attention recently. Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably, the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Defects on Thermal Transport across Solid/Solid Heterogeneous Interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ershuai Yin, Wenzhu Luo, Lei Wang, Qiang Li</p>
            <p>During the fabrication of heterogeneous structures inside chips, impurities and defects are inevitably introduced. However, the mechanism by which defects affect interfacial heat transport remains unclear. In this work, a microscale thermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects. The effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport characteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal conductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show that, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects weakens heat transport. Higher defect concentration leads to lower ITC. Furthermore, when defects are in SiC or Diamond, which have broader phonon spectral distributions, their impact on ITC is weaker. For the GaN/SiC interface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a defect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present in GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC. This behavior arises from defect-induced phonon energy redistribution near the interface. The redistribution increases the population of low-frequency phonons, which are more capable of crossing the interface, thus enhancing heat transfer. This study enriches the fundamental understanding of thermal transport across semiconductor heterointerfaces and guides the design and fabrication of high-ITC heterostructures.</p>

The double-peak structure of NMR spectra emerging above 29 T applied along the [001] direction evidences the successive magnetic transitions. The field dependence of NMR spectra was analyzed on the basis of cluster mean-field theory, which allows us to propose possible magnetic structures for the high-field magnetic states.</p>

            <p>Chiral materials are rare in nature, yet they play a fundamental role in modern physics due to their unconventional topological properties and transport responses. While chiral charge and structural orders have been extensively studied, chiral magnetic order -- particularly in altermagnets (AMs) -- remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the experimentally well-characterized three-dimensional metal-organic framework K[Co(HCOO)$_3$] represents the first realization of a chiral second-order topological insulator with altermagnetic order. This system hosts $\emph{g}$-wave spin-split bands, controllable second-order topological states, and chirality-locked anomalous transport properties. Its second-order topological phase manifests as alternating spin-up and spin-down hinge modes along the boundaries of hexagonal nanotubes. Remarkably, these spin-polarized hinge states can be switched through lattice chiral inversion. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical effects exhibit reversed signs in left/right-handed enantiomers, substantiating a universal chirality-controlled response across both electronic and optical channels. Our results establish chiral AMs as a promising platform for non-volatile topological spintronics, opening new avenues for manipulating quantum transport via lattice chirality.</p>

            <h2>Extraction of classical ergotropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Campisi</p>
            <p>Finding the time dependent perturbation that extracts the maximal amount of energy (a.k.a. ergotropy) from a thermally isolated quantum system is a central, solved, problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum ergotropy problem.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pinaki Dutta, Kamal L Panigrahi, Vishwanath Shukla</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that a continuous two frequency drive is a versatile and robust protocol to control the lifetime of quantum many body scars and to engineer non-equilibrium phases of driven quantum matter. By modulating the frequency ratio $c$ (any rational number), we systematically explore prethermal features across a broad frequency range. For small integer values of $c$, we observe ergodicity breaking even at moderately low frequencies, signaling long-lived scarred dynamics. By continuously increasing $c$, one can generate non-monotonic transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics. These observations are consistent with the predictions of an effective Floquet Hamiltonian based approach. Furthermore, we exploit this tunability to engineer fractional subharmonic responses, highlighting the potential of two-frequency driving as a theoretical platform for controlling scars, prethermalization, and time crystal-like behavior.</p>

            <p>This thesis develops exact analytical tools to study strongly correlated stochastic systems, with a focus on extreme value statistics, gap statistics, and full counting statistics in multi-particle processes. A central contribution is the universal characterization of conditionally independent identically distributed variables-random variables that become independent upon conditioning on latent parameters. This structure arises naturally in systems with stochastic resetting, a mechanism that generates strong long-range correlations while retaining analytical tractability. Using this framework, we derive universal closed-form expressions for several observables across diverse models, including Brownian motion, Levy flights, ballistic particles, and Dyson Brownian motion, under various resetting protocols. In particular, we demonstrate that resetting induces analytically tractable non-equilibrium steady states. Theoretical predictions are supported by numerical comparisons and experimental comparisons in systems such as diffusive particles in switching harmonic traps. Applications to search optimization are also explored, identifying regimes where resetting enhances or impairs first-passage efficiency, and proposing rescaling-based protocols that outperform traditional resetting.</p>

            <p>We discuss the Fermi-velocity renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene due to Coulomb exchange interaction within an atomistic tight-binding model. Adopting the Slater-Koster parametrization for the hopping parameters obtained from first principles, our results only depend on the effective dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the Hubbard-interaction $U$. The Fermi velocity of graphene increases twist-angle independent by $~25\%$ for $\epsilon=10$ and $U=4eV$, leading to an increase by more than $100\%$ of the flat bandwidth at twist-angle $\theta=1.4^\circ$. Including also the renormalization of the out-of-plane hopping terms, we further observe a shift of the magic angle from $1.02^\circ$ to $0.96^\circ$. Our results offer a microscopic explanation of the critical temperature, $T_c$, as function of the twist angle where the largest $T_c$ is found at $\theta_{max}=1.1^\circ$. For $\theta>\theta_{max}$, $T_c$ is obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the Cooper channel. For $\theta<\theta_{max}$, the discussion is based on the critical line of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition.</p>

            <p>The triple-Q state arises due to the superposition of three symmetry equivalent spin spirals stabilized by higher-order exchange interactions. It has been predicted more than 20 years ago but was only recently discovered in a Mn monolayer on the Re(0001) surface. To date little is known about the thermodynamic properties of this intriguing non-coplanar spin state. Here, we reveal a low-temperature phase transition between the triple-Q and the row-wise antiferromagnetic state in this system via Monte Carlo simulations based on an atomistic spin model parametrized by density functional theory. By modeling the free energy landscape in terms of thermal excitations we derive an analytical expression of the partition function, which allows us to prove that the phase transition is driven by entropy. The predicted phase transition is not unique to Mn/Re(0001) but appears for a wide range of magnetic interaction parameters and is expected to occur also for other multi-Q states.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin Hall edge transport in two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides depends on whether their one-dimensional edge channels are preserved under realistic substrates and device boundaries. Here we implement spin-orbit coupling in DFTB and GFN-xTB within the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, and apply it to 1T$'$/2H WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Edge-projected spectra reveal robust edge states in 1T$'$ ribbons; and these states remain robust against a laterally infinite 2H substrate, which only shifts the Dirac point via long-wavelength corrugation without introducing additional in-gap states. By contrast, terminated 2H edges generate trivial dispersion branches in the same energy window that hybridize only weakly with the topological edge modes. In the bulk, Fermi-level states are 1T$'$-derived; at the small twist angle, lattice-relaxation-induced strain drives miniband reconstruction, whereas at the large twist angle, the layers become electronically decoupled. These findings suggest the conditions -- controlled twist angle and avoidance of terminated 2H edges -- for achieving quantized conductance and unambiguous spectroscopic</p>

            <p>We investigate the consequences of information exchange between a system and a measurement-feedback apparatus that cools the system below the environmental temperature. A quantitative relationship between entropy pumping and information acquired about the system is derived, showing that, independent of the concrete realization of the feedback, the latter exceeds the former by a positive amount of excess information flow. This excess information flow satisfies a trade-off relation with the precision of the feedback force, which places strong constraints on both the information-theoretic cost of feedback cooling and the required magnitude of the feedback force. From these constraints, a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of optical feedback cooling is derived. Finally, the results are demonstrated for feedback cooling by coherent light scattering. We show that measurement precision is the major factor determining the attainable temperature. Precise measurements can also be leveraged to reduce the required feedback force, leading to significantly more energy-efficient cooling close to the fundamental bound for realistic parameter values.</p>

            <p>CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density (JON) and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct tunneling (DT) and Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric (FE) switching, DT, FN tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high JON and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications.</p>

            <p>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) provide fundamental constraints on the interplay between power fluctuations, entropy production, and efficiency in overdamped stationary autonomous heat engines. However, their validity in underdamped regimes remains limited and less explored. Here, we analytically and numerically study a physically realizable autonomous heat engine composed of two underdamped continuous degrees of freedom coupled to a two-level system. We show that this nonlinear setup can robustly violate TUR-based trade-offs by exploiting resonant coupling, effectively using one underdamped mode as an internal periodic drive. When this coupling is suppressed, the system recovers TUR-like bounds consistent with overdamped theory. Importantly, we demonstrate that the strongest suppression of current fluctuations occurs in a resonance regime that can be directly inferred from mean current measurements - a quantity typically much easier to access experimentally than fluctuations. Our results reveal new pathways to circumvent classical TUR constraints in underdamped systems and provide practical guidelines for designing efficient, precise microscopic engines and autonomous clocks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ege Eren, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli</p>
            <p>When the time-reversal and parity symmetries in a fluid are broken, transverse transport coefficients can arise in response to perturbations, an example being odd viscosity. We refer to these systems as odd fluids. While much progress has been made in the continuum theory of odd-viscous fluids, and non-collisional models for odd viscous fluids have been proposed, a classical microscopic description in which the transverse responses originate from collisions is lacking. In this paper, we show that a dilute granular gas of rough and inelastic particles driven by a constant torque is a minimal microscopic model of an odd fluid. By applying the methods of Boltzmann kinetic theory, we obtain a hydrodynamic description of the microscopic model. Then, using the method of adiabatic elimination, we numerically compute all the response coefficients of the model, explicitly showing that the model has many odd response terms. Our theory predicts that certain odd response coefficients can change sign even when the direction of the external torque is fixed. While we choose a particular case, the procedure we present can be applied to any collisional model. We also present a semi-quantitative method to determine the hydrodynamic variables of the theory by observing the eigenvalue spectrum of the linear collision operator.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) in infinite-layer nickelate films with different disorder levels. The disordered NdNiO$_{2}$ film exhibits a flat $S/T$ curve, whereas cleaner samples display a logarithmic divergence with decreasing temperature, followed by a pronounced ``hump'' near 25 K. These distinct behaviors reveal a disorder-driven transition from band-structure-dominated transport to quantum-critical-dominated transport. Below the ``hump'' temperature, four-fold symmetry breaking is observed in the in-plane angular magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic order in parent infinite-layer nickelate films. Furthermore, the logarithmic divergence in $S/T$ is also observed in a clean superconducting Sm$_{0.73}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.22}$NiO$_{2}$ film, where it coexists with linear-in-temperature resistivity over the same temperature range. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum criticality over a wide doping range in clean infinite-layer nickelate films, similar to cuprates, which highlights the central role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in their superconducting pairing mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism is a novel magnetic phase combining characteristics of both antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetic ordering. Despite growing theoretical interest in altermagnetic materials, reports of experimentally verified high Neel temperature layered compounds are limited or remain to be firmly established. Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we identify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature of 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of altermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature dependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable band shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel temperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These findings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetic phenomena.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin structures with non-trivial topology that comprise two-dimensional quasi-particles and are promising information carriers for data storage and processing devices. Skyrmion lattices in magnetic thin films exhibit Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) phase transitions and have garnered significant interest for studying emergent 2D phase behavior. In experimental skyrmion lattices, the main factor limiting the quasi-long-range order in thin films has been the non-flat energy landscape - often referred to as pinning effects. We demonstrate direct control of the skyrmion lattice order by effectively tuning the energy landscape employing magnetic field oscillations. By quantifying lattice order and dynamics, we explore how domain boundaries form and evolve due to pinning effects in Kerr microscopy experiments and in Brownian dynamics simulations, offering a pathway to control and study emergent skyrmion lattice properties and 2D phase behavior.</p>

            <p>Reports of photoluminescence from GeSn grown on Ge substrates by molecular beam epitaxy have been limited. We find that one limiting factor to observing photoluminescence is due to localized defect states marked by photoluminescence at 2400 nm and originating from the Ge substrate and buffer layer. In this study, we report on an optical study utilizing doped Ge(001) substrates to effectively suppress defect-related photoluminescence in GeSn layers by filling localized defect trap states. For this experiment, a GeSn layer with Sn content up to 10.5% was grown on a doped Ge(001) substrate. Analysis of the physics of the photoluminescence spectrum collected from the GeSn thin film shows an emission at the expected wavelength of 2300 nm for 10.5% Sn content and the absence of the typically observed defect related signal at 2400 nm. This understanding is further confirmed using short pulse optical excitation of the GeSn grown on undoped Ge substrates.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation at room temperature offers a promising pathway toward quantum photonic technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. A key challenge in this field is to engineer a controlled platform where strong confinement, nonlinear interactions, and structural disorder coexist, unlocking access to rich collective behavior and unconventional condensate dynamics. We demonstrate polariton condensation in CsPbBr$_3$ microplatelets that self-assemble into whispering gallery mode microresonators featuring tight lateral photon confinement finely balanced with intrinsic disorder. The system exhibits hallmark signatures of out-of-equilibrium condensation, including a non-linear increase in emission intensity, spectral narrowing, and interaction-induced blueshift. Intrinsic disorder subtly reshapes the cavity energy landscape, inducing condensate fragmentation and enabling direct optical access to the condensate wavefunction. Interferometric measurements reveal extended phase coherence, whereas characteristic fork-shaped fringe dislocations confirm the presence of quantized vortices pinned by the disordered potential. These topological excitations underscore the rich physics driven by the interplay of gain, loss, confinement, and disorder. Our work establishes a scalable platform for investigating driven-dissipative quantum fluids of light at room temperature, where the intrinsic disorder balances optical confinement and provides a window into condensate wavefunction, coherence, and vortex phenomena. This study system opens new opportunities for exploring many-body physics and potentially advancing topological photonics in integrable microcavity architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei I. Pavlov, Mikhail N. Kiselev</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum noise in a mesoscopic quantum dot serving as a realization of the charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model weakly coupled to a fermionic lead via a tunnel contact. We find noise signatures under voltage and temperature biases that can serve as clear markers of the SYK physics in experiments with related setups. We develop a linear response theory that treats all types of noise on the same footing and generalizes a concept of transport coefficients for charge and heat currents, as well as relations between them, to equilibrium noise power. Within this theory, we find characteristic scaling of the noise coefficients with temperature in all regimes that can be relevant for experimental realizations of the SYK dots, find a set of universal constants, with their values being unique to the SYK physics, that connect these coefficients, and characterize noise manifestations of the Coulomb blockade. Beyond SYK systems, these results may serve as a general framework for identification of non-Fermi-liquid signatures in mesoscopic transport and provide additional observables for experiments on thermoelectric phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueshui Zhang, Ying-Hai Wu, Meng Cheng, Hong-Hao Tu</p>
            <p>We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</p>

            <p>Topological invariants, rigorously defined only in the thermodynamic limit, have been generalized to topological indicators applicable to finite-size disordered systems. However, in many experimentally relevant situations, such as semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) hybrid nanowires hosting Majorana zero modes, the interplay between strong disorder and finite-size effects renders these indicators (e.g., the so-called topological visibility) biased and ill-defined, significantly limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we propose the topological invariant rigorously defined for an infinite system constructed by periodically repeating the original finite disordered system, as a topological indicator. Using the one-dimensional SM-SC hybrid nanowire as an example, we show that this general and transparent approach yields faithful topological indicators free from the biases affecting commonly used finite-size indicators, capturing the nature (topological or trivial) of the phase at generic points in parameter space, and providing a reliable tool for interpreting experimental results.</p>

            <h2>Strain-induced Ettingshausen effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautham Varma K, Azaz Ahmad, Gargee Sharma</p>
            <p>Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties. Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our study to be particularly timely and relevant.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Interactions of Wigner Crystal in Magnetic Field and Berry Curvature: Multi-Particle Tunneling through Complex Trajectories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyung-Su Kim</p>
            <p>We study how a weak perpendicular magnetic field $B$ and a Berry curvature $\Omega$ modify the magnetic interactions of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal (WC), using the semi-classical large-$r_s$ expansion. When only a magnetic field is present, various ring-exchange interactions arise from electron tunneling along {\it complex} trajectories, which constitute {\it complex instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in $B$, each ring-exchange constant acquires an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase equal to the magnetic flux enclosed by the real tunneling trajectory of the $B=0$ problem. This effect is directly relevant to two-dimensional electron systems with a small $g$-factor ($g \ll 1$). In the presence of a Berry curvature, multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a (complexified) phase space $({\bf r}, {\bf k})$. To leading order in $\Omega$, the exchange constants acquire the Berry phase enclosed by a {\it purely imaginary} trajectory in a momentum space. Finally, when both $B$ and $\Omega$ are non-zero, in addition to having the AB and Berry phase factors, the magnitude of the exchange constant can also be renormalized by an effective-mass correction. These effects may be relevant for the WC and its proximate phases recently observed in tetra- and penta-layer rhombohedral graphene.</p>

            <p>The growing demand for photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are lightweight, flexible, and seamlessly integrated into diverse applications has propelled interest in thin-film solar cells. Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition.</p>

            <p>Michaelis-Menten kinetics is one of the most recognized models in enzyme kinetics, crucial for the understanding of biochemical reactions in several metabolic processes. In this study, we perform a stochastic analysis of the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the introduction of inhibitory mechanisms, which significantly diversifies the study of the reaction. We apply the Fock space formalism to reformulate the master equation, transforming it into a Schrödinger-type equation. We investigate reversible inhibitions and analyze the behavior of the averaged number of substances involved, identifying a stiffness behavior in all scenarios. In a specific case of partial inhibition, we observe that the inhibitor can act as an activator that favors product formation. We calculate the first product formation time (FPFT), which characterizes the time statistic of the first product formation. We observe the emergence of an intermediate time scale in addition to the two known time scales typical in first-passage problems. This intermediate time scale is closely aligned with the slow-binding kinetics observed in experimentally observed enzymatic reactions that involve inhibitors. This intermediate time scale is related to the new pathways introduced by the presence of inhibitors. This study offers a new perspective on inhibited enzymatic reactions, and demonstrates the usefulness of the Fock space formalism in the analysis of complex chemical systems.</p>

            <p>Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates and material properties.</p>

            <p>As deep learning applications continue to deploy increasingly large artificial neural networks, the associated high energy demands are creating a need for alternative neuromorphic approaches. Optics and photonics are particularly compelling platforms as they offer high speeds and energy efficiency. Neuromorphic systems based on nonlinear optics promise high expressivity with a minimal number of parameters. However, so far, there is no efficient and generic physics-based training method allowing us to extract gradients for the most general class of nonlinear optical systems. In this work, we present Scattering Backpropagation, an efficient method for experimentally measuring approximated gradients for nonlinear optical neural networks. Remarkably, our approach does not require a mathematical model of the physical nonlinearity, and only involves two scattering experiments to extract all gradient approximations. The estimation precision depends on the deviation from reciprocity. We successfully apply our method to well-known benchmarks such as XOR and MNIST. Scattering Backpropagation is widely applicable to existing state-of-the-art, scalable platforms, such as optics, microwave, and also extends to other physical platforms such as electrical circuits.</p>

Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of N independent two-level electrons interacting with Schrödinger cat or kitten states of light. Without measurement, a macroscopic cat state of electrons appears only in an ultrashort time window. In contrast, we demonstrate that photon-number parity or quadrature projective measurements can restore a macroscopic cat state in nonequilibrium electrons, even in the thermodynamic limit. These dynamics are captured by an external-field approximation, in which the electronic system evolves into a Rabi-oscillation cat state. Our results highlight the need for precise quantum measurement techniques for light to control macroscopic quantum states of matter driven by quantum light.</p>

            <p>In our previous study, we proposed the low-rank antisymmetric product of geminals (APG) method, which reconstructs the wavefunction by extracting only the important eigenvalues from the APG wave function.

In this work, we reformulate the orbital part of the wavefunction using Givens rotation matrices, enabling an analytical treatment of the variational optimization. By combining the low-rank APG with the direct Givens rotation (DGR) method, we achieved a significant improvement in optimization efficiency. We applied the developed method to small molecular systems and confirmed that it provides high accuracy, while also significantly reducing the computational time compared to conventional methods.</p>

            <p>Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</p>

            <p>Understanding the behavior of the water-ammonia system at high pressure-high temperature conditions is important for modeling the internal dynamics of exoplanet icy mantles. Conventionally, mixtures of ammonia hemihydrate AHH (2:1 ammonia-water molar ratio) and H2O ice VII have been regarded as the ultimate solid phase assembly in the system. Here we report evidence for chemical reactions between AHH and ice VII above 750 K and 16 GPa that stabilize water-rich ammonia hydrates, including a novel ultra-water rich hydrate NH3.6H2O (1:6 ratio) coexisting with ammonia dihydrate ADH (1:2 ratio) and excess ice VII. This assembly is stable up to at least 30 GPa and 1600 K and can be quenched to room temperature. Our results demonstrate that water-rich ammonia hydrates are favored in the icy mantle of 1-2 MEarth exoplanets regardless of the ammonia content of the hydrate crystallized during accretion and/or evolution as long as excess H2O ice is available. The buoyancy contrast between water-rich hydrates and ice VII may lead to chemical stratification in exoplanet icy mantles, hence affecting their thermal evolution.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Phase Transitions in Open Quantum Walks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov dynamics [G. Teza {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies, including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.</p>

First, 1312 synthetic three-dimensional microstructures were generated and evaluated using established algorithms, and a labeled data set of ground-truth parameters was built. Converting every structure into a persistence image allowed us to train a deep neural network that predicts the eight descriptors. In an independent test set, the model achieved on average R^2 ~ 0.84 and Pearson r ~ 0.92, demonstrating both precision and generality. The approach provides a unified and scalable tool for rapid characterization of functional porous materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Faílde, A. Gómez, J. Fernández-Rossier</p>
            <p>We consider the preparation of single-spinon wave functions, relevant for one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin models, in a quantum computer. We adopt the recently proposed ansatz \cite{kulk} for the single-spinon wave function, where a state with $S=1/2$ is built in a spin chain with $L+1$ sites, adding a site with $S_z=1/2$ to the configurations of the ground-state wave function for the spin chain with length $L$. We extend the original work to the case of the Haldane-Shastry model. We discuss how to prepare the single-spinon ansatz both for the Heisenberg and Haldane-Shastry models in quantum computers, using a linear combination of unitaries. We consider three different strategies to compute the single-spinon energy in a quantum computer and analyze their cost in terms of the number of qubits, gates, and circuits.</p>

            <h2>Load-Balanced Diffusion Monte Carlo Method with Lattice Regularization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kousuke Nakano, Sandro Sorella, Michele Casula</p>
            <p>Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the many-body Schrödinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations. QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers, making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework. DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance, which grows as $\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high parallel efficiency ($\sim$98\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\rm w}= 51200$), together with a speedup of $\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers.</p>

            <h2>Continuous-wave, high-resolution, ultra-broadband mid-infrared nonlinear spectroscopy with tunable plasmonic nanocavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Xie, Nobuaki Oyamada, Francesco Ciccarello, Wen Chen, Christophe Galland</p>
            <p>Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy is a technique to probe the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared wavelengths while detecting the upconverted signal at visible wavelengths. It has recently transitioned from large-area molecular films and colloidal suspensions to nanoscale structures, enabled by dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that confine light and matter in the same deep-subwavelength sensing volume. Here, we implement continuous-wave ultra-broadband SFG and DFG spectroscopy from $860$ to $1670~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ on a variety of dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. The use of a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and the absence of geometric phase-matching requirements speed up and simplify data acquisition. At the same time, simultaneous access to SFG and DFG sidebands permits ratiometric signal analysis, enabling both common-noise rejection and field-normalized characterization of coherent response. The resulting spectra harbour the signatures of coherent interference between the resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the $\chi^{(2)}$ susceptibility, previously only observed under fs- and ps-pulsed excitation. We demonstrate the versatility and reproducibility of our approach across several molecules that yield distinct resonant and nonresonant mid-infrared responses. Together, these features position our platform as a scalable route toward multiplexed, high-resolution mid-IR sensing and a potential basis for coherent single- or few-molecule vibrational detection at the chip level.</p>

            <p>In the absence of decoherence the current of fermionic particles across a finite lattice connecting two reservoirs (leads) with different chemical potentials is known to be ballistic. It is also known that decoherence typically suppresses this ballistic current. However, if decoherence is weak, the change in the current may be undetectable. In this work we show that the effect of a weak decoherence can be amplified by orders of magnitude if the lattice has edge states.</p>

            <h2>NHSE-Driven Coalescence of Topological Defect States in Non-Hermitian Systems</h2>

            <p>In this work, we describe a novel localization phenomena, the so-called topological defect accumulation, occurring in a non-Hermitian chain with an arbitrary number of defect sites. Specifically, it refers to the localization and coalescence of multiple defect eigenstates at a single defect site closest to the localization edge of the bulk non-Hermitian skin modes. This phenomenon is distinct from the conventional topological defect states in Hermitian systems, where the defect states are separately localized at their respective defect sites. The requirement for the onset of topological defect accumulation is the presence of non-reciprocal coupling which renders the chain non-Hermitian, as well as imaginary onsite potentials at the defect nodes. This allows the defect state accumulation and distribution to be modulated by both the defect site distribution and their corresponding onsite potentials paving the way for possible applications. Furthermore, this phenomenon is realizable in various synthetic and experimentally realizable platforms, such as topolectrical and photonic systems.</p>

            <p>Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic constraints, leading to ballistic and non-ergodic behavior at different detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation.</p>

            <p>The fermion sign problem constitutes one of the most fundamental obstacles in quantum many-body theory. Recently, it has been suggested to circumvent the sign problem by carrying out path integral simulations with a fictitious quantum statistics variable $\xi$, which allows for a smooth interpolation between the bosonic and fermionic limits [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This $\xi$-extrapolation method has subsequently been applied to a variety of systems and has facilitated the analysis of an x-ray scattering measurement taken at the National Ignition Facility with unprecedented accuracy [\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. Yet, it comes at the cost of performing an additional $10-20$ simulations, which, in combination with the required small error bars, can pose a serious practical limitation. Here, we remove this bottleneck by presenting a new re-weighting estimator, which allows the study of the full $\xi$-dependence from a single path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation. This is demonstrated for various observables of the uniform electron gas and also warm dense beryllium. We expect our work to be useful for future PIMC simulations of Fermi systems, including ultracold atoms, electrons in quantum dots, and warm dense quantum plasmas.</p>

Erbium ions (Er$^{3+}$) exhibit a unique combination of a telecom (1.5 $\mu$m) optical transition and an effective spin-$1/2$ ground state, but identifying a host that enables heterogeneous device integration while preserving long optical and spin coherence remains an open challenge. We explore a new platform of Er$^{3+}$:CeO$_2$ films on silicon, offering low nuclear spin density and the potential for on-chip integration. We demonstrate a 38.8 $\mu$s spin coherence, which can be extended to 176.4\nobreakspace $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling.

            <p>Ammonia, a critical chemical fertilizer and a potential hydrogen carrier, can be sustainably synthesized from atmospheric nitrogen and water under ambient conditions through photocatalysis. In this study, high-entropy oxides with d0 and mixed d0+d10 cationic configurations are introduced as a new group of catalysts for nitrogen fixation and photocatalytic ammonia production. The oxides exhibit impressive efficiency in ammonia production compared to binary oxides, while the efficiency is improved by using a mixed cationic configuration. It was shown that the incorporation of d10 elements, such as gallium and zinc, boosts the photocatalytic reactions by improving light absorbance, charge separation and charge lifetime. These findings demonstrate the potential of high-entropy oxides as next-generation photocatalysts for green ammonia synthesis, offering an effective alternative to conventional catalytic systems.</p>

            <p>Dielectric breakdown of insulators is one of the most common failure modes of electronics in the high-radiation environment of space, but its mechanics remain poorly understood. When electron-irradiated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) undergoes breakdown, the resulting channels exhibit striking periodic structures with characteristic wavelengths ~80 {\mu}m in the recently identified ivy-mode channels. These previously unobserved modulations offer unique insights into the physics of ultra-fast dielectric breakdown. Through materials characterization and theoretical modeling, we identify the physical instability mechanism responsible for these structures. Raman spectroscopy reveals that carbon deposition correlates with channel width variations, indicating that periodic structure formation occurs during the plasma discharge phase. We evaluated three candidate instability mechanisms: the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld instability, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability, and the z-pinch entropy mode. The first two mechanisms operate on incompatible timescales and require unphysical material parameters to match observations. In contrast, the z-pinch entropy mode operates during the nanosecond discharge phase and produces wavelengths consistent with plasma densities of 0.1-1% of solid density and temperatures of 10-100 eV. Current measurements from isolated discharge channels (~200 A) validate theoretical predictions for the entropy mode. These findings establish that the entropy mode plasma instability during the discharge phase, rather than post discharge thermal or mechanical processes, govern periodic structure formation in breakdown channels. This work provides new insights into the physics of dielectric breakdown and establishes a framework for predicting discharge morphology and characteristics in insulators.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic Paradox and Non-Hermitian Topological Singularities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mario G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Unidirectional modes in magnetically biased electromagnetic systems have long been associated with a thermodynamic paradox: the absence of counter-propagating channels may produce non-integrable singularities that may act as unphysical sinks of thermal radiation. Here we revisit this problem and show that material dissipation alone cannot regularize the singular behavior, in sharp contrast with reciprocal systems where any loss suffices. Instead, the paradox is resolved by nonlocal effects, which suppress the material response at short wavelengths and eliminate field singularities altogether. Our analysis reveals a fundamental link between nonlocality, topology, and thermodynamic consistency, showing that real-space singularities and ill-defined topologies go hand in hand, even in strongly dissipative platforms. These findings clarify the physical origin of the paradox and establish nonlocality as a natural and robust mechanism for its resolution, opening new avenues to explore the intertwined roles of topology and nonlocality in passive nonreciprocal photonics.</p>

            <p>Accurately estimating ground-state energies of quantum many-body systems is still a challenging computational task because of the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with the system size. Sample-based diagonalization (SBD) methods address this problem by projecting the Hamiltonian onto a subspace spanned by a selected set of basis configurations. In this article, we introduce two neural network-enhanced approaches for SBD: sample-based neural diagonalization (SND) and adaptive-basis SND (AB-SND). Both employ autoregressive neural networks to efficiently sample relevant basis configurations, with AB-SND additionally optimizing a parameterized basis transformation so that the ground-state wave function becomes more concentrated. We consider different classes of basis transformations: single-spin and non-overlapping two-spin rotations, which are tractable on classical computers, and also more expressive global unitaries that can be implemented using quantum circuits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques on various quantum Ising models, showing that SND achieves high accuracy for concentrated ground states, while AB-SND consistently outperforms both SND and more conventional SBD methods, allowing entering regimes in which the ground state is not concentrated in the original computational basis.</p>

            <p>Control over the interaction of waves with ultrafast time-varying materials - those that change on a time-scale commensurate with the wave period - holds much promise for developing a raft of new technologies. Time-varying materials exchange energy with the waves passing through them, thus exhibiting entirely new phenomena not possible with static media. Work to date has largely considered the realisation of ultrafast time-varying materials, with much less attention paid to how their interaction depends upon the shape of the incident waves themselves. Here we experimentally demonstrate 'waveform shaping' within ultrafast time-varying media: temporal shaping of incident pulses to optimise specific dynamic material interactions. We create an ultrafast time-varying medium by rapidly modulating a waveguide termination, and measure the spectrally resolved reflection matrix. Analysis of this reflection matrix enables the identification of the incident waveforms that undergo a desired spectral transformation. Using this approach, we first characterise the medium's eigenpulses; temporal modes that reflect from the medium without spectral distortion. Next, we identify the waveforms that are either maximally or minimally reflected, enabling strong broadband absorption arising from the temporal modulation of the medium. Finally, we show how energy can be optimally concentrated into a user-defined set of frequency bands upon reflection. Our work paves the way towards new applications of ultrafast time-varying media, spanning from optics to microwaves and acoustics.</p>

We generate these basis sets by augmenting existing STO-3G, STO-6G, and MOLOPT basis sets optimizied for ground state energy calculations. The augmented MOLOPT basis sets achieve fast convergence of $GW$ gaps and Bethe-Salpeter excitation energies, while maintaining low condition numbers of the overlap matrix to ensure numerical stability. For $GW$ HOMO-LUMO gaps, the double-zeta augmented MOLOPT basis yields a mean absolute deviation of 60 meV to the complete basis set limit. The basis set convergence for excitation energies from time-dependent density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is similar. We use our smallest generated augmented MOLOPT basis (aug-SZV-MOLOPT-ae-mini) to demonstrate $GW$ calculations on nanographenes with 2312 atoms requiring only 3500 core hours and 2.9 TB RAM as computational resources.</p>

            <p>We investigate photon production from media characterized by a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5(t)$. We first consider the chiral anomaly as a small perturbation and show that $\mu_5\to 2\gamma$ process generates non-polarized radiation, as the probabilities of producing right and left-handed photons are equal. In chiral semimetal with a vanishing chiral chemical potential but a finite separation of Weyl nodes, ${\bf \Delta}(t)$, the photon production vanishes at the leading order of perturbation theory. We then employ the method of Bogolyubov transformation to obtain the photon spectrum that sums up all powers of $\mu_5$. Employing the exactly solvable model $\mu_5(t) \propto A+B\tanh(t/\tau)$, we demonstrate that the spectrum exhibits strong circular polarization, whose direction is determined by the sign of $\mu_5$. The spectrum contains resonances associated with the instability of the electromagnetic field in chiral media. We discuss potential phenomenological applications of these findings.</p>

            <p>The single droplet under shear is a foundational problem in fluid mechanics. In computational fluid dynamics, the two-dimensional (2D) formulation offers advantages in both computational efficiency and relevance, yet its theoretical treatment remains relatively underdeveloped. In this brief note, we present an analytical treatment of this problem, beginning with a derivation of the Lamb solution for 2D Stokes flows, which in turn is used to obtain the flow fields around a droplet in a purely extensional flow. Using these flow fields, expressions are obtained for the apparent viscosity, $\mu^*$, of a dilute emulsion as well as a small deformation theory. We show that $\mu^* = \mu( 1 + f(\lambda) \phi) + \mathcal{O}(\phi^2)$ with $f(\lambda) = (2\lambda + 1)/(\lambda + 1)$ where $\lambda$ is the ratio of the droplet viscosity to the matrix viscosity and $\phi$ is the area fraction covered by the suspended phase. Also the steady state value of the Taylor deformation parameter $D_T^\infty$, in the capillarity-dominated regime, obeys $D_T^\infty = g(\lambda)\,\text{Ca}$, where Ca is the capillary number and $g(\lambda) = 1$. This contrasts with the 3D case, where $g(\lambda)$ depends on $\lambda$. These results are then validated through direct numerical simulations across a wide range of viscosity ratios ($0.01 < \lambda < 100$). Our results provide a basic theoretical framework for interpreting 2D droplet simulations and provide clear benchmarks for computational fluid dynamics.</p>

            <p>Nanoconfined water plays a key role in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and catalysis, yet its reactivity remains a matter of debate. Prior studies have reported both enhanced and suppressed water self-dissociation relative to the bulk, but without a consistent explanation. Here, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials trained at first-principles accuracy, we investigate dissociation behavior in water confined within 2D slit pores and nanodroplets, using graphene and hexagonal boron nitride as model materials. We find that reactivity is extremely sensitive to water density, confinement width, geometry, material flexibility, and surface chemistry. Despite this complexity, we show that chemical potential -- together with interfacial interactions -- governs dissociation trends and explains the variability observed in prior studies. This thermodynamic perspective reconciles previous contradictions and reveals how nanoscale environments can drastically shift water reactivity. Our findings provide molecular-level insight and offer a design lever for modulating water chemistry at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>Accurate quantum simulations of catalysis on metal surfaces are critical for advancing energy and materials science. Yet most existing methods fall short: density functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational efficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction energetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface, where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of complex catalytic systems.</p>

            <p>Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.</p>

This fusion action can be considered on $A$, and we prove a categorical generalization of Schur-Weyl duality for this action. For any fusion subcategory $\EuScript{B}$ of $\EuScript{C}_A$ containing all the local $A$-modules, we prove the invariant subobject $B=A^\EuScript{B}$ is a condensable subalgebra of $A$. The assignment of $\EuScript{B}$ to $A^\EuScript{B}$ defines a Galois correspondence between this kind of fusion subcategories of $\EuScript{C}_A$ and the condensable subalgebras of $A$. In the context of VOA, we prove for any nice VOAs $U \subset A$, $U=A^{\EuScript{C}_A}$ where $\EuScript{C}=\EuScript{M}_U$ is the $U$-module category. In particular, if $U = A^G$ for some finite automorphism group $G$ of $A,$ the fusion action of $\EuScript{C}_A$ on $A$ is equivalent to the $G$-action on $A.$</p>

The system and the reservoirs evolve and interact via random collision described by a Kac-type master equation. The initial state of the reservoirs is given by 2 Maxwellian distributions at temperature $T_+$ and $T_-$. We show that, for times much shorter than $\sqrt{N}$ the interaction with the reservoirs is well approximated by the interaction with 2 Maxwellian thermostats, that is, heat reservoirs with $N=\infty$. As a byproduct, if $T_+=T_-$ we extend the results in \cite{BLTV} to particles in 3 dimension.</p>

We show that even when the many-body eigenstates of the system are ergodic, a sufficiently strong coupling to the bath may effectively localize the spins due to many-body quantum Zeno effect, as manifested by the hole-burning shape of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum.

            <h2>Poisson-Nernst-Planck charging dynamics of an electric double layer capacitor: symmetric and asymmetric binary electrolytes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Palaia, Adelchi J. Asta, Megh Dutta, Patrick B. Warren, Benjamin Rotenberg, Emmanuel Trizac</p>
            <p>A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold.</p>

            <h2>Impurity screening by defects in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Hai Wu, Yueshui Zhang, Hong-Hao Tu, Meng Cheng</p>
            <p>We propose a novel mechanism of impurity screening in (1+1)$d$ quantum critical states described by conformal field theories (CFTs). An impurity can be screened if it has the same quantum numbers as some gapless degrees of freedom of the CFT. The common source of these degrees of freedom is the chiral primary fields of the CFT, but we uncover that topological defect lines of the CFT may also take this role. Theoretical analysis relies on the insight that the impurities can be interpreted as edge modes of certain symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. By stacking a SPT state with a CFT, one or two interfaces on which the SPT edge modes reside are created. If screening occurs due to topological defect lines, a symmetry-enriched CFT with exotic boundary states are obtained. The boundary conditions that appear in these cases are difficult to achieve using previously known methods. As a concrete example, we consider a spin-1 chain whose bulk is described by the SU(3)$_{1}$ CFT and edges are coupled to spin-1/2 impurities. We demonstrate that both the low-energy eigenstates and the extracted Affleck-Ludwig entropy are in excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Stability of quasicrystalline ultracold fermions to dipolar interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini</p>
            <p>Quasiperiodic potentials can be used to interpolate between localization and delocalization in one dimension. With the rise of optical platforms engineering dipolar interactions, a key question is the stability of quasicrystalline phases under these long-range interactions. In this work, we study repulsive ultracold dipolar fermions in a quasiperiodic optical lattice to characterize the behavior of interacting quasicrystals. We simulate the full time evolution of the typical experimental protocols used to probe quasicrystalline order and localization properties. We extract experimentally measurable dynamical observables and correlation functions to characterize the three phases observed in the noninteracting setting: localized, intermediate, and extended. We then study the stability of such phases to repulsive dipolar interactions. We find that dipolar interactions can completely alter the shape of the phase diagram by stabilizing the intermediate phase, mostly at the expense of the extended phase. Moreover, in the strongly interacting regime, a resonance-like behavior characterized by density oscillations appears. Remarkably, strong dipolar repulsions can also localize particles even in the absence of quasiperiodicity if the primary lattice is sufficiently deep. Our work shows that dipolar interactions in a quasiperiodic potential can give rise to a complex, tuneable coexistence of localized and extended quantum states.</p>

            <p>The criticality enhanced correlations and susceptibility allow weak periodic driving to induce collective synchronization due to critical slowing down, providing a unique platform to study non-equilibrium order emergence. This establishes a powerful paradigm for investigating non-equilibrium order formation, yet the fundamental mechanisms of critical-point synchronization remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize a microwave pulse as a seed to induce quantum synchronization at the critical point of Floquet driven Rydberg atoms. In the experiment, the microwave periodic driving on Rydberg states acts as a seeded temporal order in subspace, which triggers synchronization across the entire ensemble. The behavior of the emergent synchronized oscillation is elaborately linked to alterations in the seed, such as the relative phase shift and the frequency difference, which result in phase-dependent seeding and embryonic synchronization. This result opens up new possibilities for studying and harnessing time-dependent quantum many-body phenomena, offering insight into the behavior of complex many-body systems under seeding.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elizabeth J. Dresselhaus, Alexander Avdoshkin, Zhetao Jia, Matteo Secli, Boubacar Kante, Joel E. Moore</p>
            <p>Emerging experimental platforms use amorphousness, a constrained form of disorder, to tailor meta-material properties. We study localization under this type of disorder in a family of 2D models generalizing recent experiments on photonic systems. Models in this family reside on amorphous analogs of kagomé lattices with fixed coordination number, vary by a tunable synthetic field, and remarkabaly, permit exact results. We observe two kinds of localization that emerge in these models: Anderson localization by amorphous disorder, and the existence of compact, macroscopically degenerate localized states as in many crystalline flat bands. The flat-band-like degeneracy innate to kagomé lattices survives under amorphousness without on-site disorder. This phenomenon arises from the cooperation between the structure of the compact localized states and the geometry of the amorphous graph. More surprisingly, for particular values of the field, such states emerge in the amorphous system that were not present on the kagomé lattice in the same field. Outside the flat band, constrained amorphous graph geometry necessitates the existence of a fully delocalized state, near which we observe evidence of a localization-delocalization transition. Our platform serves as a demonstration of how the qualitative behavior of a disordered system can be tuned at fixed graph topology and lead to localization phenomena unique to amorphous systems that are not observed in their generically disordered counterparts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Jie Jason Gao, Fu-Ling Yang, Michael C. Holcomb, Jerzy Blawzdziewicz</p>
            <p>We create a mechanical digger able to move within 2D densely-packed granular media, in a manner intrinsically different from the existing biomimic diggers. The characteristics of our design include that the average grain size is about one tenth as large as the digger, and the area packing density {\phi} is about 90% of the jamming density {\phi}c. Unlike conventional autonomous diggers that move by fluidizing the surrounding granular media with a much finer grain size, our digger swiftly bypasses this mobility mechanism as coarse grains with interparticle friction are hard to be fluidized. To cope with high interparticle friction, the digger has a circular shape and singly captures granular particles near the front entrance of the recess formed by the center unit running across its body and then ejects the captured particles backwards. We validate this moving strategy in both experiments using a manual digger and the corresponding numerical simulations, and demonstrate that the moving efficiency can be enhanced by the judgement of the human operator but the effectiveness is not significantly influenced by the shape of granular particles. In addition, localized vibration is needed to degrade friction between interlocked irregular-shaped particles. Our numerical results show that the distribution of both moving distances and time intervals between consecutive ejections follow a power-law Further, we experimentally verify this finding by demonstrating that similar power-laws are observed from an automated digger which regularly randomizes its digging direction. Finding these spatio-temporal power laws indicates that digging within a densely-packed granular environment could be a critical phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Dielectric breakdown of physical vacuum (Schwinger effect) is the textbook demonstration of compatibility of Relativity and Quantum theory. Although observing this effect is still practically unachievable, its analogue generalizations have been shown to be more readily attainable. This paper demonstrates that a gapped Dirac semiconductor, methylammonium lead-bromide perovskite (MAPbBr$_3$), exhibits analogue dynamical Schwinger effect. Tunneling ionization under deep sub-gap mid-infrared irradiation leads to intense photoluminescence in the visible range, in full agreement with quasi-adiabatic theory. In addition to revealing a gapped extended system suitable for studying the analogue Schwinger effect, this observation holds great potential for non-perturbative field sensing, i.e., sensing electric fields through non-perturbative light-matter interactions. First, this paper illustrates this by measuring the local deviation from the nominally cubic phase of a perovskite single crystal, which can be interpreted in terms of frozen-in fields. Next, it is shown that analogue dynamic Schwinger effect can be used for nonperturbative amplification of non-parametric upconversion process in perovskites driven simultaneously by multiple optical fields. This discovery demonstrates the potential for material response beyond perturbation theory in the Schwinger regime, offering extremely sensitive light detection and amplification across an ultrabroad spectral range not accessible by conventional devices.</p>

            <h2>Topological defect-mediated corner states and higher-order bulk topology in a two-dimensional crystalline insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manideep Gone, Srijata Lahiri, Nabyendu Das</p>
            <p>We report appearance of non-trivial zero energy corner modes in the form of topological defects (trimers) in a carefully designed 2D crystalline topological insulator. The proposed scenario is developed via an unconventional stacking of 1D topological atomic chains with crystalline mirror symmetry along the diagonal (y=x) line. Our analysis shows that by systematically varying the hopping parameters t (intra-chain), v (within the unit cell) and w (between the unit cells) the system exhibits more than one distinct non-trivial second order topological phases. These phases are distinguished by the zero energy corner modes. In one of these phases the system supports four zero modes. Two of them reside on the trimers and the rest on isolated sites situated at the corner along the diagonal line. However, in the second case, the zero modes on the isolated sites persist at the corners while the zero modes on the trimers vanish. A critical look at the phase evolution of the Bloch states helps in investigating the topology of these phases via using winding numbers. Our work also shows the bulk-corner correspondence that exist between the invariants and the zero modes at the corners. With four zero modes at the corners and a winding number as 2, we conclude that the system has transformed into a second order topological insulator via tuning of the hopping amplitudes.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of many-body localized systems: logarithmic lightcones and $\log \, t$-law of $α$-Rényi entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Toniolo, Sougato Bose</p>
            <p>In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional local spin systems, the XXZ model with random magnetic field is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOM), but assuming instead that the system's dynamics gives rise to a Lieb-Robinson bound (L-R) with a logarithmic lightcone, we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation, starting from a generic product state, of $ \alpha$-Rényi entropies, with $ \alpha $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law, that denotes a slow spread of entanglement. This is in sharp contrast with Anderson localized phases that show no dynamically generated entanglement. To prove this result we apply a general theory recently developed by us in arXiv:2408.00743 that quantitatively relates the L-R bounds of a local Hamiltonian with the dynamical generation of entanglement. Assuming instead the existence of LIOM we provide new independent proofs of the known facts that the L-R bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic light cone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zhang, Ziqiang Wang</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have shown that the nonzero center of mass momentum pair density wave (PDW) is a widespread phenomenon observed over different superconducting materials. However, concrete theoretical model realizations of the PDW order have remained elusive. Here, we study a one-dimensional model with nearest-neighbor pairing attraction, i.e. a spinful Kitaev chain, under generic spin-orbit couplings such that the spin-rotation symmetry is fully broken. The most general superconducting order parameter is described by a spatial dependent $\mathbf{d}_i$-vector. We show that a spin-triplet pair density wave (t-PDW) emerges in the ground state and occupies a large part of the phase diagram. The $\mathbf{d_i}$-vector of the t-PDW rotates with a pitch $Q_{\rm pdw}$ along the chain and spans an ellipsoid. The pure t-PDW is fully gapped and realizes a class-DIII topological superconductor, characterized by two Majorana zero modes localized at each end of the chain and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into the exotic pure PDW superconductor and provide a possible explanation for the one-dimensional PDW detected along domain walls in monolayer iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se) and potentially realizable using other quantum structures in unconventional superconductors.</p>

            <p>The use of pressure to obtain new materials that can be recovered under ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples, such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended covalent-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO$_2$ has been extensively studied because of its status as a prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, has been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but below room temperature. Here we report ab initio calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O$_2$), rather than the compound CO$_2$, lowers the onset of C-polymerization at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~7 GPa (complete by ~23 GPa). Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We predict that this dense phase is an energetic material which can potentially be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature.</p>

            <p>We investigate the fundamental problem of a small density of bosonic impurities immersed in a dilute Bose gas at zero temperature. Using a rigorous perturbative expansion, we show that the presence of the surrounding medium enhances the repulsion between dressed bosonic impurities (polarons) in the regime of weak interactions. Crucially, this differs from prevailing theories based on Landau quasiparticles, which neglect the possibility of quantum degenerate impurities and predict an exchange-induced attraction. We furthermore show that the polaron-polaron interactions are strongly modified if the medium chemical potential rather than the density is held fixed, such that the medium-induced attraction between thermal impurities becomes twice the expected Landau effective interaction. Our work provides a possible explanation for the differing signs of the polaron-polaron interactions observed in experiments across cold atomic gases and two-dimensional semiconductors, and it has important implications for theories of quasiparticles and quantum mixtures in general.</p>

            <p>After fifty years of lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the nature of the transition between their topological phases (confinement/deconfinement) remains challenging due to the absence of a local order parameter. In this work, we conduct a percolation analysis of Wegner's three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model using intensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling, offering fresh insights into the topological phase transitions of gauge-invariant systems. We demonstrate that, regardless of the connection rules, geometrical loops, constructed by piercing excited plaquettes percolate precisely at the thermal critical point $T_{\rm c}$, with critical exponents coinciding with those of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. Further, we construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters in a random-cluster representation, showing that they also percolate at $T_{\rm c}$, enabling access to all thermal critical exponents. Strikingly, the Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameters for both loops and FK clusters reveal a pseudo-first-order transition. This work sheds new light on the critical behavior of pure LGTs, with potential implications for condensed matter systems and quantum error correction.</p>

            <p>Electric conduction mechanisms are studied in the pressed nanoflake powder of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide (MoSxOy) depending on their content and structure. The MoSxOy nanoflakes were prepared by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution followed by aerial oxidation. The sintered nanoflakes are 10-20 nm thick and self-assembled in the "nanoflower"-shape aggregates forming powder particles. The chemical composition and structure of the powders were studied by XPS, EDS and Raman spectroscopy, which show that the powders have different chemical composition and structure depending on the preparation conditions. These studies revealed the existence of different forms of MoS2 and its oxides in the powders. These features are impactful on electric transport properties. The current vs voltage (I-V) dependences of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal hysteresis-like behavior; and their loop width depends on the chemical composition and structure. In the samples with the highest content of Mo in the oxide/sulfoxide form the negative differential conductivity has been observed. The I-V curves of all MoSxOy nanoflake samples manifest the three-state resistive switching and the long-lasting transient charge/discharge on switching "on/off" the voltage across the sample, which evidences the role of interface charges in their conductivity. To describe theoretically the observed I-V curves, polar and electric-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, the Landau-Cahn-Hilliard approach considering flexo-chemical field has been used. The revealed in experiment and explained theoretically features of resistive switching and charge accumulation look promising for applications in memristors and high-performance supercapacitors.</p>

            <p>In the last decades multifaceted manifestations of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation theory have been identified for the many-electron problem. Yet, the investigations have been so far mostly limited to paramagnetic states, where symmetry breaking is not allowed. Here, we extend the analysis to the spontaneously symmetry-broken antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of the repulsive Hubbard model. To this aim, we calculated two-particle quantities using dynamical mean-field theory for the AF-ordered Hubbard model and studied the possible occurrence of divergences of the irreducible vertex functions in the charge and spin sectors. Our calculations pinpoint the divergences in the AF phase diagram, showing that while the onset of AF order mitigates the breakdown of the perturbation expansion, it does not fully prevent it. Moreover, we have been able to link the changes in the dynamical structure of the corresponding generalized susceptibilities to the physical crossover from a weak-coupling (Slater) to a strong-coupling (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet, which takes place as the interaction strength is gradually increased. Finally, we discuss possible physical consequences of the irreducible vertex divergences in triggering phase-separation instabilities within the AF phase and elaborate on the implications of our findings for two-dimensional systems, where the onset of a long-range AF order is prevented by the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</p>

            <p>Obstructed atomic phases, with their realizations in systems of diverse dimensionality, have recently arisen as one of the topological states with greatest potential to show higher-order phenomena. In this work we report a special type of obstruction, known as orbital-mediated atomic obstruction, in monolayers of materials with spatial symmetry described by the space group $P$-$3m1$. By means of a minimal tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we show that this obstructed phase is related to the mismatch of the charge centers coming from the atomic limit with respect to the centers that are obtained from a reciprocal space description. Although we find atomic limits that correspond with occupied atomic sites, orbital-mediated atomic obstruction requires the presence of orbitals that have no support in real space. In order to demonstrate the nontrivial character of the obstruction, we confirm the presence of a filling anomaly for finite geometries that is directly associated with the bulk configuration, and discuss the role of the boundary states and their underlying mechanism. Several material examples are presented to illustrate the ubiquity of these nontrivial responses and, in turn, to discuss the differences related to the particular ground state configuration. In addition, we perform a survey of materials and elaborate a list of candidate systems which will host this obstructed phase in monolayer form.</p>

            <p>Topological Anderson insulators (TAIs) provide a mechanism for topological phase transitions in disordered systems and have implications for quantum material design. In this work, we investigate the emergence of multiple TAIs in a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled (SOC) chain subject to Fibonacci modulation, which transforms a trivial band structure into a sequence of topologically nontrivial phases. This behavior is characterized by the appearance of zero-energy modes and changes in the $Z_2$ topological quantum number. As the SOC amplitude decreases, the number of TAI phases increases, a feature that is closely related to the fractal structure of the energy spectrum induced by Fibonacci modulation. In contrast to conventional TAI phases with fully localized eigenstates, the wave functions in the Fibonacci-modulated TAI phases display multifractal properties. This model can be experimentally realized using a Bose-Einstein condensate in a momentum-space lattice, where its topological transitions and multifractal features can be explored through quench dynamics.</p>

            <p>Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling, it is exceedingly challenging to realize systematically accurate and predictive numerical simulations. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</p>

            <h2>Dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in the $5d^2$ Re-based double perovskites Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$</h2>

            <p>Double perovskites containing heavy transition metal ions are an important family of compounds for the study of the interplay between electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling. Here, by combining magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and neutron scattering measurements, we investigate the dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in two prototype rhenium-based double perovskite compounds, Ba$_2$YReO$_6$ and Ba$_2$ScReO$_6$. A type-I dipolar antiferromagnetic ground state with a propagation vector $\mathbf{q} = (0, 0, 1)$ is observed in both compounds. At temperatures above the magnetic transitions, a quadrupolar ordered phase is identified. Weak spin excitations, which are gapped at low temperatures and softened in the correlated paramagnetic phase, are explained using a minimal model that considers both the dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. At larger wavevectors, we observe dominant phonon excitations that are well described by density functional calculations.</p>

            <h2>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta</p>
            <p>The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the symmetry allowed nearest-neighbor intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the nearest-neighbor intrinsic SOC incorporated in a minimal tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$, where SOC terms emerge due to the electric field produced by the surrounding atoms not lying in the kagome plane. Further, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi$=constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed minimal tight-binding model.</p>

            <h2>Velocity correlations of vortices and rarefaction pulses in compressible planar quantum fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashton S. Bradley, Nils A. Krause</p>
            <p>We present a quantitative analytical framework for calculating two-point velocity correlations in compressible quantum fluids, focusing on two key classes of superfluid excitations: vortices and rarefaction pulses. We employ two complementary approaches. First, we introduce a new ansatz for vortex cores in planar quantum fluids that enhances analytic integrability. This ansatz yields closed-form expressions for power spectra and velocity correlations for general vortex distributions. Using it, we identify distinct signatures of short- and long-range velocity correlations corresponding to vortex dipoles and vortex pairs, respectively. Second, we analyze the fast rarefaction pulse regime of the Jones-Roberts soliton. By applying the asymptotic high-velocity wavefunction, we derive analytic expressions for the velocity power spectrum and correlation function, capturing the soliton characteristic length scale. We validate our analytical results for the homogeneous system against numerical treatment of a large trapped system, finding close quantitative agreement. Our findings provide the first analytic treatment of velocity correlations for Jones-Roberts solitons in quantum fluids of light [M. Baker-Rasooli et al., Physical Review Letters, 134, 233401 (2025)], and establish a foundation for characterizing vortices and solitons in compressible quantum fluids.</p>

            <h2>Quantum entanglement of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points in one dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Hao Zhong, Hai-Qing Lin, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic symmetry-enriched quantum critical points by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic symmetry-enriched criticality. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</p>

            <h2>Optical response of the supersolid polaron</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurent H. A. Simons, Ralf Klemt, Tilman Pfau, Michiel Wouters, Jacques Tempere</p>
            <p>The ground-state properties of the supersolid polaron consisting of a neutral impurity immersed in a dipolar supersolid have recently been studied. Here, the optical response of an impurity in a dipolar supersolid is calculated and interpreted in terms of the contributions of the different excitation modes of the supersolid. The optical absorption spectrum reveals the two Van Hove singularities that correspond to the flattening of the two Goldstone modes of the supersolid at the Brillouin zone edge. A single peak is found in the superfluid regime corresponding to the roton minimum which diverges at the transition. We propose the response of an ionic impurity as an experimental probe for the supersolid excitations and show how this technique can be extended to neutral impurities with an electric or magnetic dipole moment.</p>

            <h2>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</p>

            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the thermal Hall effect can originate from magnons (magnon Hall effect), phonons (phonon Hall effect), or their combination (magnon-polaron Hall effect). The magnon-polaron Hall effect, first observed in Fe2Mo3O8, is particularly intriguing as its thermal Hall signal can be remarkably large. In this study, we explore the thermal Hall effect in MnPS3, an insulating antiferromagnetic material exhibiting a spin-flop transition and significant magnetoelastic coupling, making it a strong candidate for studying the thermal Hall effect originating from spin-lattice coupling. We report an exceptionally large thermal Hall angle down to 4 K and show that it cannot be accounted for by standard calculations based on the intrinsic magnon-polaron Berry curvature. Our findings provide an in-depth analysis of the role of the spin-flop transition in the thermal properties of MnPS3 and call for further theory development on magnon-phonon coupling and scattering to reveal their influence on transverse heat transport.</p>

            <h2>Circular Photon Drag Effect in Dirac electrons by Quantum Geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guanxiong Qu</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry is a well-established framework for understanding transport and optical responses in quantum materials. In this work, I study the photon drag effect in Dirac electrons using the quantum geometric interpretation of non-vertical optical transitions. Due to the particle-hole symmetry inherent in Dirac electrons, the shift photon-drag photocurrent is dominated by dissipationless Fermi surface contributions, connected to the dipole of quantum metric tensor. I find that this dipole is significantly enhanced by a small band gap in massive Dirac electrons and remains robust in the massless limit. I demonstrate the existence of a circular shift photon-drag current in the effective Hamiltonian at the L-point of bismuth, where the bands exhibit trivial topology, highlighting the ubiquity of the circular photon-drag effect in centrosymmetric materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Arian Zad, Michal Jaščur, Azam Zoshki, Ralph Kenna, Nerses Ananikian</p>
            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

            <p>Ultra-cold atomic systems provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena, offering tunable interactions and diverse trapping geometries. In this study, we investigate a one-dimensional system of trapped fermionic atoms using the composite boson formalism, which describes pairs of opposite-spin fermions as cobosons (short for composite bosons). By constructing a superposition ansatz of coboson states, we solve the Schrödinger equation for two fermion pairs under both attractive and repulsive interactions. We determine key observables such as particle density profiles and two-body correlations. Additionally, we compute the low-lying energy spectrum and estimate the pairing gap. Our results highlight the potential of the coboson formalism for exploring quantum phenomena in strongly correlated few-body systems, achieving results comparable to standard exact diagonalization techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priyanuj Rajbongshi, Ranjan Modak</p>
            <p>The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, a prime example of a one-dimensional topologically nontrivial insulator, has been extensively studied in flat space-time. In recent times, many studies have been conducted to understand the properties of the low-dimensional quantum matter in curved spacetime, which can mimic the gravitational event horizon and black hole physics. However, the impact of curved spacetime on the topological properties of such systems remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the curved spacetime (CST) version of the SSH model by introducing a position-dependent hopping parameter. We show, using different topological markers, that the CST-SSH model can undergo a topological phase transition. We find that the topologically non-trivial phase can host zero-energy edge modes, but those edge modes are asymmetric, unlike the usual SSH model. Moreover, we find that at the topological transition point, a critical slowdown takes place for zero-energy wave packets near the boundary, indicating the presence of a horizon, and interestingly, if one moves even a slight distance away from the transition point, wave packets start bouncing back and reverse direction before reaching the horizon. An extended version of the CST-SSH model, which supports distinct topological phases characterized by higher winding numbers, has also been studied. We show that a similar critical slowdown of wave packets near the boundary occurs at all topological transition points between any two distinct phases. A semiclassical description of the wave packet trajectories also supports these results.</p>

            <p>We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve $\sim 97.2\pm0.1\%$ test accuracy on MNIST and $\sim 88.0\pm0.1\%$ on Fashion-MNIST without requiring any significant hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Tosti Guerra, Federico Marini, Francesco Sciortino, Lorenzo Rovigatti</p>
            <p>Associative polymers (APs) with reversible, specific interactions between ``sticker'' sites exhibit a phase behavior that depends on a delicate balance between distinct contributions controlling the binding. For highly-bonded systems, it is entropy that mostly determines if, on increasing concentration, the network forms progressively or \textit{via} a first-order transition. With the aim of introducing an experimentally-viable system tailored to test the subtle dependence of the phase behavior on the binding site topology, here we numerically investigate AP polymers made of DNA, where ``sticker'' sites made by short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a single sticker type, $(AA)_6$, and one with two distinct alternating types, $(AB)_6$. At low temperature, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond, the $(AA)_6$ system remains homogeneous, while the $(AB)_6$ system exhibits phase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions from simpler bead-spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer conformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind this separation arises from the different topological constraints associated with intra- versus inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a controllable, realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the thermodynamics of associative polymer networks depends on the bonding site architecture in a clean and controlled way.</p>

            <p>We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.</p>

We propose an approach that eliminates software errors using formal logic, providing proofs of correctness. We use the Lean theorem prover and programming language to create a rigorous, mathematically verified framework for computing molecular interaction energies. We demonstrate this in LeanLJ, a package of functions, proofs, and code execution software that implements Lennard Jones energy calculations in periodic boundaries. We introduce a strategy that uses polymorphic functions and typeclasses to bridge formal proofs (about idealized Real numbers) and executable programs (over floating point numbers). Execution of LeanLJ matches the current gold standard NIST benchmarks, while providing even stronger guarantees, given LeanLJ's grounding in formal mathematics. This approach can be extended to formally verified molecular simulations, in particular, and formally verified scientific computing software, in general.

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted significant interest due to their tunable physical properties when stacked into homo- and hetero-structures. Twisting adjacent layers introduces moiré patterns that strongly influence the material electronic and thermal behavior. In twisted graphene systems, the twist angle critically alters phonon transport, leading to reduced thermal conductivity compared to Bernal-stacked configurations. However, experimental investigations into thermal transport in twisted structures remain limited. Here, we study the local thermal properties of twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) using Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM). We find an increase in thermal resistance of $0.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^6 KW^{-1}$ compared to untwisted bilayers, attributed to changes in both intrinsic thermal conductivity and the tip-sample interface. These results, supported by analytical modeling, provide new insight into thermal transport mechanisms in twisted 2D systems and offer a pathway toward thermal engineering in twistronic devices.</p>

Upon excitation by a short laser pulse, the polarization wave emits intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) radiation at the ferroelectric transverse optical phonon frequency, modulates the ferroelectric order parameter, and propagates uniaxially along the polar axis at hypersonic velocities of ~105 m/s. These long-lived, uniaxial, and dipole-carrying polarization waves may find applications in narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and coherent electric control.</p>

            <p>EuAl$_4$ exhibits a complex phase diagram, including the development of a charge density wave (CDW) below $T_{CDW} = 145$ K. Below $T_{N}=15.4$ K, a series of antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered phases appear, while non-trivial topological phases, like skyrmion lattices, are stabilized under an applied magnetic field. The symmetries of the variously ordered phases are a major issue concerning the understanding of the stabilization of the ordered phases as well as concerning the interplay between the various types of order. EuAl$_4$ at room temperature has tetragonal symmetry with space group $I4/mmm$. The CDW phase has an incommensurately modulated crystal structure described by the modulation wave vector $\mathbf{q} \approx 0.17\mathbf{c}^{*}$. On the basis of various experiments, including elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering, and second-harmonic generation, it has been proposed that the symmetry of the CDW phase of EuAl$_4$ could be centrosymmetric orthorhombic, non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic or non-centrosymmetric tetragonal. Here, we report temperature-dependent, single-crystal x-ray diffraction experiments that show that the CDW is a transverse CDW with phason disorder, and with non-centrosymmetric symmetry according to the orthorhombic superspace group $F222(0\,0\,\sigma)00s$.Essential for this finding is the availability of a sufficient number of second-order ($2\mathbf{q}$) satellite reflections in the x-ray diffraction data set. The broken inversion symmetry implies that skyrmions might form due to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, instead of a more exotic mechanism as it is required for centrosymmetric structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mina-Lou Schleith, Tomohiro Soejima, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moiré systems has raised the interesting possibility of realizing phases of itenerant anyons. Anyon dispersion is only possible in the absence of continuous magnetic translation symmetry (CMTS). Motivated by this, we consider anyons on the sphere in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field which breaks the ${\rm SU}(2)$ rotation symmetry, the analog of CMTS on the sphere, down to a ${\rm U}(1)$. This allows us to study the energy dispersion of the anyons as a function of $L_z$ angular-momentum, while maintaining the perfect flatness of single-particle dispersion. We parametrize the non-uniform field by a real parameter $R$ which concentrates the field at the north (south) pole for $R>1$ ($R < 1$), and show that, for our choice of field, any $p$-body correlation function evaluated in the space of Laughlin quasiholes can be mapped \emph{exactly} to a corresponding $p$-body correlation function in uniform field. In the thermodynamic limit, this enables us to analytically compute the interaction-generated spatially varying potential felt by the anyons. Remarkably, such spatially varying potential is sufficient to generate dispersion for the anyons, which we compute exactly, up to an overall scaling constant. The anyon dispersion in our model describes azimuthal motion around the sphere at a constant height, similar to spin precession. Our work therefore serves as a concrete demonstration that interaction alone can generate nonzero anyon dispersion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Börge Göbel, Samir Lounis</p>
            <p>Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>In principle, the logarithm of a partition function and its derivatives can be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations in practice, since resolving the singularity of a logarithmic partition function requires extremely high-precision data,especially when distinguishing weakly first-order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on the finite-size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be extracted by eliminating the analytic terms. This is achieved by computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in various quantum many-body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting weakly first-order phase transitions, such as in JQ models, which were initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for studying quantum many-body phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Ultracold dipolar atoms and molecules provide a flexible quantum simulation platform for studying strongly interacting many-body systems. Determining microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of the simulator is crucial for it to be useful. We study effective interactions emerging in quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) dipolar quantum gases, revealing significant nonuniversal corrections to the commonly used 1D pseudopotential. We demonstrate that a full 3D treatment employing realistic interaction potentials is essential for describing the reduced-dimensional system. Our findings are particularly relevant to experiments probing excited states and nonequilibrium phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher-harmonic magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by Néel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the sub-terahertz frequency range. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Tunable hyperbolic Landau-level polaritons in charge-neutral graphene nanoribbon metasurfaces</h2>

            <p>Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</p>

            <p>The interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom offers a versatile playground for the realization of a variety of correlated phases of matter. However, the types of spin-orbital interactions are often limited and challenging to tune. Here, we propose and analyze a new platform for spin-orbital interactions based upon a lattice of Wigner molecules in moiré transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Leveraging the spin-orbital degeneracy of the low-energy Hilbert space of each Wigner molecule, we demonstrate that TMD materials can host a general spin-orbital Hamiltonian that is tunable via the moiré superlattice spacing and dielectric environments. We study the phase diagram for this model, revealing a rich landscape of phases driven by spin-orbital interactions, ranging from ferri-electric valence bond solids to a helical spin liquid. Our work establishes moiré Wigner molecules in TMD materials as a prominent platform for correlated spin-orbital phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongjin Kim, Robin Schäfer, David M. Long, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Anushya Chandran</p>
            <p>Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic, and thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are already unstable. Chaotic instabilities thus far precede thermalization. In a different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain (confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold. The latter leads to chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale, which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.</p>

            <p>The ferroelectric switching speed has been experimentally obfuscated by the interaction between the measurement circuit and the ferroelectric switching itself. This has prohibited the observation of real material responses at nanosecond timescales and lower. Here, fundamental polarization switching speeds in ferroelectric materials with the perovskite, fluorite, and wurtzite structures are reported. Upon lateral scaling of island capacitors from micron to nanoscales, a clear transition from circuit-limited switching to a material-limited switching regime is observed. In La$_{0.15}$Bi$_{0.85}$FeO$_{3}$ capacitors, switching is as fast as ~150 ps, the fastest switching time reported. For polycrystalline Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_{2}$ capacitors, a fundamental switching limit of ~210 ps is observed. Switching times for Al$_{0.92}$B$_{0.08}$N are near 20 ns, limited by the coercive and breakdown electric fields. The activation field, instantaneous pseudo-resistivity, and energy-delay are reported in this material-limited regime. Lastly, a criterion for reaching the material-limited regime is provided. This regime enables observation of intrinsic material properties and favorable scaling trends for high-performance computing.</p>

            <h2>Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohan Mittal, Tom Zander, Johannes Lang, Sebastian Diehl</p>
            <p>Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge, both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation, suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum phenomena in fermionic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruijie Xu, Sergei Nechaev</p>
            <p>We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a half-line $x \ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) with distribution $Q(u_j)$, located at $x=0$. By computing the first two moments, $\langle G_N \rangle$ and $\langle G_N^2 \rangle$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over different disorder distributions, we provide the explicit condition for coincidence/distinction of pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the transition points of annealed and quenched systems are always different, although for finite systems there exists a "gray zone" in which this distinction may be hardly noticeable. This result may help reconcile opposing viewpoints on whether quenching is marginally relevant.</p>

            <p>Spin shuttling offers a promising approach for developing scalable silicon-based quantum processors by addressing the connectivity limitations of quantum dots (QDs). In this work, we demonstrate high-fidelity bucket-brigade (BB) spin shuttling in a silicon MOS device, utilizing Pauli Spin Blockade (PSB) readout. We achieve an average shuttling fidelity of \SI{99.8}{\percent}. The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate. An appropriate four-level Hamiltonian model supports our findings. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing high-performance spin shuttling systems in future quantum architectures.</p>

            <p>S-substituted FeSe superconductors in the tetragonal phase display several unique features among iron-based superconductors, particularly the presence of zero-energy excitations in the superconducting (SC) state. The recent concept of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces (BFSs), a theoretical model describing ultranodal states, has attracted considerable interest. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) have revealed an anomalous low-energy spin fluctuations deep in the SC state. The low-energy spin fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature, supporting strong Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions associated with BFSs. Here, we further investigate these correlation effects through $^{77}$Se-NMR measurements of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) under pressures up to 2.0 GPa and temperatures down to ~100 mK. The results demonstrate that the anomalous enhancement is suppressed but persists under pressure, implying that quasiparticle interactions become weak by applying pressure. Furthermore, spin fluctuations in the normal state exhibit different temperature dependence from those deep in the SC state, suggesting that the nesting properties of normal electrons differ from those of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. These findings are consistent with the theoretical model of BFSs with C$_2$ symmetry and strengthen evidence for Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions, providing insights into the unconventional pairing state of this system.</p>

            <p>We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.</p>

            <h2>Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Chang Chen, Ken-Ming Lin</p>
            <p>Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics, combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhang, Wen-Tao Xu</p>
            <p>Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</p>

            <p>The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or electric field.

            <p>Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics, quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder, thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.</p>

The recently observed chirality-induced spin selectivity effect demonstrates that chiral materials break both symmetries.

A magnetic-field-induced superconducting diode effect is demonstrated in both devices by a statistically significant difference in $I_{c+}$ and $|I_{c-}|$, and we show evidence for a zero-field diode effect in the right-handed/left-handed device but not the right-handed/right-handed device. A maximum asymmetry of 5\% is observed in both devices. We provide a few explanations for the presence of the superconducting diode effect in these devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiki Fukusumi</p>
            <p>The algebraic or ring structure of anyons, called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rules in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFT and categorical symmetry of the TO or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The recent topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we present a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</p>

            <h2>Connectivity structure and dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David G. Clark, Owen Marschall, Alexander van Meegen, Ashok Litwin-Kumar</p>
            <p>Studies of the dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks often assume independent and identically distributed couplings, but large-scale connectomics data indicate that biological neural circuits exhibit markedly different connectivity properties. These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytic expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low-dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the \textit{Drosophila} connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetric exclusion process with long-range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Belitsky, N.P.N. Ngoc, G.M. Schütz</p>
            <p>We introduce the headway exclusion process which is an exclusion process with $N$ particles on the one-dimensional discrete torus with $L$ sites with jump rates that depend only on the distance to the next particle in the direction of the jump but not on $N$ and $L$. For measures with a long-range two-body interaction potential that depends only on the distance between neighboring particles we prove a relation between the interaction potential and particle jump rates that is necessary and sufficient for the measure to be invariant for the process. The normalization of the measure and the stationary current are computed both for finite $L$ and $N$ and in the thermodynamic limit. For a finitely many particles that evolve on $\mathbb{Z}$ unidirectionally it is proved by reverse duality that a certain family of non-stationary measures with a microscopic shock and antishock evolves into a convex combination of such measures with weights given by random walk transition probabilities. On macroscopic scale this domain random walk is a travelling wave phenomenon tantamount to phase separation with a stable shock and a stable antishock. Various potential applications of this result and open questions are outlined.</p>

            <h2>Strings as Hyper-Fractons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erica Bertolini, Hyungrok Kim</p>
            <p>We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</p>

            <h2>Magnon cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit system via two-magnon driving and dissipation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gang Liu, Gen Li, Huatang Tan, Jie Li</p>
            <p>We propose an efficient method for dissipative generation of magnonic cat states in a cavity-magnon-qubit hybrid system by exploiting a two-magnon driving and dissipation mechanism. When both the magnon and qubit are driven, a coherent nonlinear two-magnon interaction is induced, wherein the qubit and the magnon mode exchange energy through magnon pairs. The dissipation of the qubit is exploited to steer the magnon mode into a quantum superposition of distinct coherent states, where the magnon mode evolves into either an even or odd cat state, depending on the parity of the magnon initial state. For the case where the magnon initial state is a superposition state, e.g., of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$, the magnon mode can evolve into a weighted mixture of the even and odd cat states. We also find that magnon squeezed states may emerge during the short-time evolution, showcasing the capability of our mechanism in preparing diverse magnon non-classical states. Magnonic cat and squeezed states are macroscopic quantum states and find applications in macroscopic quantum studies and quantum sensing, e.g., in the dark matter search using ferromagnetic axion haloscopes.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement generation and scaling from noisy quenches across a quantum critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Jafari, J. Naji, A. Langari, Vahid Karimipour, Henrik Johannesson</p>
            <p>We study the impact of noise on the dynamics of entanglement in the transverse-field Ising chain, with the field quenched linearly across one or both of the quantum critical points of the model. Taking concurrence as a measure of entanglement, we find that a quench generates entanglement between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor spins, with noise reducing the amount of entanglement. Focusing on the next-nearest-neighbor concurrence, known to exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling with the square root of the quench rate in the noiseless case, we find a different result when noise is present: The concurrence now scales logarithmically with the quench rate, with a noise-dependent amplitude. This is also different from the ``anti-Kibble-Zurek" scaling of defect density with quench rate when noise is present, suggesting that noisy entanglement generation is largely independent from the rate of defect formation. Intriguingly, the critical time scale beyond which no entanglement is produced by a noisy quench scales as a power law with the strength of noise, with the same exponent as that which governs the optimal quench time for which defect formation is at a minimum in a standard quantum annealing scheme.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino</p>
            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium introduce microwave losses that degrade the performance of superconducting resonators. While such losses have been extensively studied above 1~K, we report here their direct quantification in the millikelvin and low-photon regime relevant to quantum devices. Using a high-quality factor 3-D niobium cavity cooled through its superconducting transition in controlled magnetic fields, we isolate vortex-induced losses and find the resistive component of the sensitivity to trapped flux $S$ to be approximately 2~n$\Omega$/mG at 10~mK and 6~GHz. The decay rate is initially dominated by two-level system (TLS) losses from the native niobium pentoxide, with vortex-induced degradation of $T_1$ occurring above $B_{\text{trap}}\sim$~50~mG. In the absence of the oxide, even 10~mG of trapped flux limits performance $Q_0\sim$~10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, underscoring the need for stringent magnetic shielding. The resistive sensitivity $S$ decreases with temperature and remains largely field-independent, whereas the reactive component, $S'$, exhibits a maximum near 0.8~K. These behaviors are well modeled within the Coffey-Clem framework in the zero-creep limit, under the assumption that vortex pinning is enhanced by thermally activated processes. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits can tolerate vortex-induced dissipation at trapped field levels up to several hundred mG, but achieving long coherence times still requires careful magnetic shielding to suppress lower-field losses from other mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in laser excitation of the low-energy nuclear isomer transition in $^{229}$Th have opened avenues for developing nuclear clocks, a novel quantum technology with exceptional performance and sensitivity to exotic physics. Here we explore the host-dependence of the nuclear clock frequency, focusing on the isomer shift induced by the difference in the nuclear charge distribution between the ground and excited nuclear states. We combine relativistic many-body methods of atomic structure with periodic density functional theory to evaluate the isomer shifts in solid-state hosts. We elucidate the critical importance of the ``relaxation'' effect in evaluating the isomer shifts. Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: $ \omega_\text{clk}(\text{solid state}) = 2,020,407,384(40) \, \text{MHz}$, $\omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{4+}) = 2,020,407,648(70) \, \text{MHz}$, and $ \omega_\text{clk}(^{229}\text{Th}^{3+}) = 2,020,407,114(70) \, \text{MHz}$. We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare $^{229}$Th nucleus to be $\omega_\text{nuc} = 8.272(22) \,\text{eV}$. Our calculated valence-band isomer shifts for different host materials constrain the nuclear transition frequencies to an 80 MHz-wide frequency window, aiding experimental searches for the $^{229}$Th nuclear transition in novel materials.</p>

            <h2>Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kühn, Gabriel Mahuas, Ulisse Ferrari</p>
            <p>Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.</p>

            <p>Large Atomistic Models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomistic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to August 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research.

            <p>We study the capacity of entanglement in certain integrable scale-invariant theories which exhibit Lifshitz scaling symmetry with a generic dynamical exponent z at the critical point. This measure characterizes the width of the eigenvalue spectrum of the reduced density matrix and is a quantum informational counterpart of heat capacity. We explore various aspects of capacity of entanglement, such as the corresponding universal terms for the ground state, its z-dependence and also its temporal evolution after a global quantum quench in two dimensions. We carefully examine the existence of a convenient entropic c-function based on this quantity both in bosonic and fermionic theories. While in the relativistic case the corresponding c-function displays a monotonic behavior under the RG flow, this is not the case for the nonrelativistic theories. We also investigate the dynamics of capacity of entanglement after a mass quench and show that it follows the quasiparticle interpretation for the spreading of entanglement. Finally, we discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including the entanglement entropy.</p>

It provides a comprehensive review of the origin and generation of entangled photons in emerging layered vdW materials, alongside various optical quantum characterization techniques. The review then explores key physical parameters of the quantum states associated with entangled photon pairs. Additionally, it examines concepts related to the realization of paired photon generation at the quantum limit. The final section focuses on the potential for on-chip integrated quantum device applications.

            <p>Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry provides a powerful framework for predicting whether transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Trapped laser-cooled ions present a pristine and highly controllable few-body system for studying this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trap potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional (3D), unit-cell-like ion clusters. We identify a set of transitions signaled by parity-odd octupole order parameters, and probe their distinct dynamical signatures. Our observations reveal the softening of a collective Higgs-like mode indicating spontaneous symmetry-breaking, hysteresis resulting from a catastrophe where a metastable state vanishes abruptly, and stochastic switching between metastable states of differing symmetries. We also uncover a remarkable coincidence of symmetry-breaking and discontinuous transitions, analogous to a thermodynamic triple point. Our results establish 3D trapped-ion clusters as a versatile platform to engineer complex potential energy landscapes, opening new avenues for studies of reaction kinetics, geometric frustration, and related phenomena in mesoscopic platforms.</p>

            <p>In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.</p>

            <p>We study the steady flow-induced deformation between an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid and a three-dimensional (3D) deformable channel. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive experimental--theoretical framework for such flows of constant-viscosity viscoelastic (i.e., Boger) fluids, which allows us to quantify the influence of the fluid's viscoelasticity on the flow rate--pressure drop ($q-\Delta p$) relation. For a flow-rate-controlled regime and weakly viscoelastic flow, we find excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results, specifically providing an experimental demonstration of how both wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity decrease the pressure drop. To definitively demonstrate the coupled effect of wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity (change of cross-sectional area and curving of streamlines), we perform experiments in an equivalent rigid channel, showing that both the Boger fluid and a viscosity-matched Newtonian fluid have the same pressure drop. Thus, the experimentally verified theory for the $q-\Delta p$ relation of weakly viscoelastic flows of Boger fluids in compliant channels can now be used for the design of microfluidics and soft hydraulic systems operating with complex fluids.</p>

            <p>The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic ranking of pathways in reaction networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Praful Gagrani, Nino Lauber, Eric Smith, Christoph Flamm</p>
            <p>Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems due to their compositionality, which makes them well-suited for analyzing interactions of subsystems within larger aggregate systems. This work presents a thermodynamic formalism for ranking CRN pathways under fixed throughput currents (fixed velocities of species flowing in and out of the system), where pathways represent subnetworks capable of performing the stipulated chemical conversion. We define a thermodynamic cost function for pathways derived from the large-deviation theory of stochastic CRNs, which decomposes into two components: an ongoing maintenance cost to sustain a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), and a restriction cost, quantifying the ongoing improbability of neutralizing reactions outside the specified pathway. Applying this formalism to detailed-balanced CRNs in the linear response regime, we prove that the resistance of a CRN decreases as reactions are added that support the throughput current, and that the maintenance cost, the restriction cost, and the thermodynamic cost of nested pathways are bounded below by those of their hosting network. Extending the analysis far from equilibrium, we find that while cost is non-decreasing for progressively more restricted nested pathways near equilibrium, multimolecular CRN examples can be found that assign lower costs to more restricted pathways at far-from-equilibrium NESSs. The possibility to reduce the resistance of a network at fixed throughput, while also simplifying the network, may have implications for enzyme family evolution, in which novel reaction mechanisms may first lead to a proliferation of pathways through non-specific catalysis, but later selection for specificity may benefit both from species retention, and more efficient use of autocatalysts to improve throughput.</p>

            <p>We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter direct detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qidong He</p>
            <p>Building on a work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a lattice and develop a method for computing upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant, which we implement in a publicly available software package. The upper bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of our results to developing Peierls-type estimates for anisotropic contour models in statistical physics, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.</p>

            <h2>Suppression of coherent light scattering in a three-dimensional atomic array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Kun Lu, Hanzhen Lin, Jiahao Lyu, Yoo Kyung Lee, Vitaly Fedoseev, Wolfgang Ketterle</p>
            <p>Understanding how atoms collectively interact with light is not only important for fundamental science, but also crucial for designing light-matter interfaces in quantum technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on arranging atoms in ordered arrays and using constructive (destructive) interference to enhance (suppress) the coupling to electromagnetic fields, thereby tailoring collective light-matter interactions. These studies have mainly focused on one- and two-dimensional arrays. However, only three-dimensional (3D) arrays can demonstrate destructive interference of coherent light scattering in all directions. This omnidirectional suppression of coherent light scattering in 3D atomic arrays has thus far not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we observe a strong reduction of light scattering in a 3D atomic array prepared in the form of a Mott insulator in optical lattices. The residual light scattering is shown to be caused by the delocalization of atoms, Raman scattering, and inelastic scattering associated with saturation. We also demonstrate how light scattering can be a sensitive probe for density fluctuations in many-body states in optical lattices, enabling us to characterize the superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition as well as defects generated by dynamical parameter ramps. The results of our work can be used to prepare subradiant states for photon storage and probe correlations for many-body systems in optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Light Induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Cubic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debabrata Sinha</p>
            <p>We investigate topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional electron system with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling driven by circularly polarized light. Within the Floquet framework, we demonstrate that light-matter interaction induces nontrivial band topology characterized by a quantized anomalous Hall response, with Chern insulating phases of C = 0, 1, and 3. These transitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light. Introducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space without modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains topologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are finite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter windows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic Rashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling strengths. These results clarify the interplay between distinct spin-orbit interactions in Floquet-engineered Chern insulators and offer experimentally relevant pathways for achieving light-controlled topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Time Crystals and Interacting Chiral Gauge Theories in Atomic BECs III: Role of the Page-Wootters mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrik Öhberg, Ewan M. Wright</p>
            <p>We build the case that our published chiral soliton model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 250402 (2019)] can lead to a genuine quantum time crystal for smaller atom numbers. To do this we compare results from the chiral soliton model with exact numerical solutions for the ground state of the three-particle Schrödinger equation in the limit that the spatial profile of the soliton is largely independent of its center-of-mass motion. The connection between the two approaches is found via the Page-Wootters mechanism, and this is what allows for dynamical evolution even in the quantum ground state, as required for a genuine quantum time crystal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ella Nikodem, Jakob Schluck, Henry F. Legg, Max Geier, Michal Papaj, Mahasweta Bagchi, Liang Fu, Yoichi Ando</p>
            <p>Many efforts have been made in the past decade to realize topological superconductivity using superconducting proximity effect, but an ideal platform is still lacking. A 3D topological insulator (TI) is promising for this purpose due to the spin-momentum-locked surface state. Here we propose a novel yet simple TI platform which gives rise to a topological phase that is robust against disorder. It consists of a bulk-insulating rectangular TI nanowire laterally sandwiched by two superconductors. In this structure, the top and bottom surfaces individually work as SNS line junctions, forming a nanometer-scale columnar SQUID in which the nanowire cross-section defines the threading magnetic flux $\Phi$ in axial magnetic fields. We theoretically show that, when the two junctions are asymmetric, a robust topological phase occurs periodically for a wide range of $\Phi$, independently of the chemical potential. Our experiment found that a TI device of this structure indeed behaves as a columnar nano-SQUID where the supercurrent flows only through the top and bottom surfaces with vanishing bulk contribution. Furthermore, the top/bottom asymmetry can be tuned by a back gate, a key ingredient for the topological phase.</p>

            <h2>Engineering subgap states in superconductors by altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Lu, Phillip Mercebach, Pablo Burset, Keiji Yada, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Yuri Fukaya</p>
            <p>We investigate the realization and control of subgap states by tailored altermagnetic fields on unconventional superconductors. When the symmetries of altermagnetism and unconventional superconductivity align, we demonstrate the emergence of bulk zero-energy flat bands, giving rise to a zero-bias conductance peak. The symmetry and strength of $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets strongly affect the surface Andreev states from $d$-wave and chiral $d$- and $p$-wave superconductors. As a result, distinct types of subgap states are realized, including curved and flat bands, that can be detected by tunneling spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that the altermagnetism-induced subgap states give rise to a large spin conductance at zero net magnetization which helps identify the strength of the underlying altermagnetism and superconductivity. Our results offer a solid route for designing and manipulating subgap states in superconducting systems, which can be useful for functionalizing superconducting spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-breaking-induced topology in FeSe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikel García-Díez, Jonas B. Profe, Augustin Davignon, Steffen Backes, Roser Valentí, Maia G. Vergniory</p>
            <p>FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases -- such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe -- topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the tetragonal $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using Topological Quantum Chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and temperature-induced structural changes lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe</p>

            <h2>Emergent Interacting Phases in the Strong Coupling Limit of Twisted M-Valley Moiré Systems: Application to SnSe${}_2$</h2>

            <p>We construct an interacting Wannier model for both AA-stacked and AB-stacked twisted SnSe2, revealing a rich landscape of correlated quantum phases. For the AA-stacked case, the system is effectively described by a three-orbital triangular lattice model, where each orbital corresponds to a valley and exhibits an approximate one-dimensional hopping structure due to a new momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetry. By exploring the interacting phase diagram using a combination of theoretical methods, including Hartree-Fock mean-field theory and exact solutions of the spin model in certain limits, we identify several exotic quantum phases. These include a dimerized phase with finite residual entropy, valence bond solids, and quantum paramagnetism. In the AB-stacked case, the system realizes an interacting kagome lattice model, where the Wannier orbitals associated with the three valleys form three sublattices. In the strong coupling regime, we use cluster mean-field methods to demonstrate the emergence of a classical spin liquid phase due to the frustrated lattice structure. The high tunability of the moiré system, which allows control over both the filling and interaction strength (via twist angle), renders twisted SnSe2 a versatile platform for realizing a wide range of exotic correlated quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>Spin and thermal current scaling at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domenico Giuliano, Francesco Buccheri</p>
            <p>We study the boundary phase diagram and the low-temperature heat and magnetization transport at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains. Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological) four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control in experimental realizations.</p>

            <h2>Atomistic Description of Spin Crossover Under Pressure and its Giant Barocaloric Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Vela, J. Ribas-Ariño, S.P. Vallone, A.M. dos Santos, M.A. Halcrow, K.G. Sandeman</p>
            <p>The pressure-dependent evolution of the spin crossover (SCO) transition has garnered significant interest due to its connection to the giant barocaloric effect (BCE) near room temperature. Pressure alters both the molecular and solid-state structures of SCO materials, affecting the relative stability of low- and high-spin states and, consequently, the transition temperature ($T_{1/2}$). Crucially, the shape of the $T_{1/2}$ vs. pressure curve dictates the magnitude of the BCE, making its accurate characterization essential for identifying high-performance materials. In this work, we investigate the nonlinear $T_{1/2}$ vs. pressure behavior of the prototypical SCO complex [FeL$_2$][BF$_4$]$_2$ [L = 2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine] using solid-state PBE+U computations. Our results unveil the mechanisms by which pressure influences its SCO transition, including the onset of a phase transition, as well as the key role of low-frequency phonons in the BCE. Furthermore, we establish a computational protocol for accurately modeling the BCE in SCO crystals, providing a powerful tool for the rapid and efficient discovery of new materials with enhanced barocaloric performance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qisheng Yu, Boyu Liu, Hongjun Xiang, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Motivated by the complementary properties of vanadium-based ferromagnets and HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics, we propose a novel multiferroic oxide, VHfO$_4$, through 50\% Hf$^{4+}$ substitution with V$^{4+}$ in the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ phase of HfO$_2$. First-principles DFT calculations reveal that the $Pca2_1$-like VHfO$_4$ phase exhibits dynamic stability and concurrent ferroic orders: robust ferroelectric polarization comparable to HfO$_2$ and V-driven magnetism. Parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations identify an antiferromagnetic ground state, while strain engineering enables tunable magnetoelectric coupling. Biaxial in-plane strain induces four magnetic states: intralayer FM/interlayer AFM, intralayer AFM/interlayer FM, spiral-like non-collinear order, and discrete alternating spin alignment. Critically, $c$-axis strain modulates magnetic energy landscapes, demonstrating electromechanical control of magnetism. This work establishes VHfO$_4$ as a Type-I multiferroic with coexisting atomic-scale ferroic origins and strain-tunable cross-coupling, offering a platform for voltage-controlled spintronics devices.</p>

            <p>The geometric structure of quantum states plays a fundamental role in determining the intrinsic dynamics of electrons in solids. In this work, we study the geometric origin of orbital angular momentum and its transport in a general two-band electronic system. Without assuming any symmetry or dimensional constraints, we show that the orbital Berry curvature, which governs the orbital Hall effect, can be universally expressed as the product of the band energy and the square of the Berry curvature. This highlights the central role of Berry curvature in engineering orbital Hall responses. We also discuss the applicability of our framework by analyzing a realistic model. Our findings underscore the geometric universality of itinerant intrinsic orbital dynamics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p>

It is shown that these predictions are excluded by the measurement data which means that the currently used Drude model does not provide a complete description of the electromagnetic response of metals for s-polarized evanescent waves. The critical importance of this result for several fields of condensed matter physics and optics dealing with evanescent waves, including the Casimir effect, is discussed.</p>

            <p>The rare earth intermetallic system \textit{R}Al\textit{X} (\textit{R} = rare earth elements, \textit{X} = Si and Ge) is known to be a promising candidate of magnetic Weyl semimetal. Due to the complex interactions between the rare earth elements and surrounding atoms, as well as hybridization with itinerant electrons, this family likely possesses highly intriguing and novel magnetic structures and thus exhibits dynamic behaviors. We systematically probe polycrystalline samples of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = La, Ce, Pr and Nd) combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS), heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The INS measurements identify well-resolved crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations at 19.2 and 24.9 meV in CeAlSi, at 5.4 meV in PrAlSi, and at 2.5 and 4.2 meV in NdAlSi. We analyzed the INS data using the corresponding CEF models and determined the CEF parameters and ground state wave functions of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd). Our results suggest strong single-ion anisotropy in their ground states: $|\pm3/2\rangle$ (94.5\%) in CeAlSi, $|\pm3\rangle$ (99.2\%) in PrAlSi, and $|\pm9/2\rangle$ (76.2\%) in NdAlSi. Notably, the weaker anisotropy and strong exchange interactions in NdAlSi promote competing magnetic orders and CEF splitting at low temperature, contrasting with the robust CEF levels in magnetic states of CeAlSi and PrAlSi.</p>

            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to non-reciprocal transport, where current flows without resistance in one direction but becomes resistive in the opposite direction, but its typical reliance on magnetic field hinders scalability and device integration. In this article, we present a theoretical framework for realizing a field-free SDE based on a two-dimensional (2D) Shiba lattice featuring a conical spin texture. Using the real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations, we illustrate that the conical spin configuration alone is sufficient to break the necessary inversion and time reversal symmetries, enabling nonreciprocal supercurrent flow without any external magnetic field, yielding diode efficiency exceeding 40%. Furthermore, we find that the efficiency of such a diode effect becomes strongly dependent on the direction of current flow, revealing a pronounced angular dependence that can be tuned by varying the pitches of the spin texture along the two spatial lattice directions. Our findings offer a pathway toward scalable, field-free superconducting components for non-dissipative electronics and quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Random Permutation Circuits are Quantum Chaotic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bruno Bertini, Katja Klobas, Pavel Kos, Daniel Malz</p>
            <p>Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.</p>

In addition to outlining the theoretical foundations-including the algebra of Majorana operators, along with the stabilizer formalism-we introduce an efficient numerical method for simulating the time-dependent dynamics of such systems. This method, based on the time dependent Pfaffian formalism, allows for the classical simulation of realistic device architectures that incorporate braiding, projective measurements, and disorder.

            <p>Three-dimensional (3D) printed preoperative planning models serve a critical role in the success of many medical procedures. However, many of these models do not portray the patient's complete anatomy due to their monolithic and static nature. The use of dynamic 3D-printed models can better equip physicians by providing a more anatomically accurate model due to its movement capabilities and the ability to remove and replace printed anatomies based on planning stages. A dynamic 3D-printed preoperative planning model has the capability to move in similar ways to the anatomy that is being represented by the model, or reveal additional issues that may arise during the use of a movement mechanism. The 3D-printed models are constructed in a similar manner to their static counterparts; however, in the digital post-processing phase, additional care is needed to ensure the dynamic functionality of the model. Here, we discuss the process of creating a dynamic 3D-printed model and its benefits and uses in modern medicine.</p>

In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks. Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</p>

            <h2>Nodal pair density waves from a quarter-metal in crystalline graphene multilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sk Asrap Murshed, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Crystalline graphene heterostructures, namely, Bernal bilayer graphene (BBLG) and rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTLG), for example, subject to perpendicular electric displacement fields, display a rich confluence of competing orders, resulting in a valley-degenerate, spin-polarized half-metal at moderate doping, and a spin- and valley-polarized (non-degenerate) quarter-metal at lower doping. Here we show that such a quarter-metal can be susceptible toward the nucleation of a unique spin- and valley-polarized superconducting ground state, accommodating \emph{odd-parity} (dominantly $p$ wave in BBLG and $f$ wave in RTLG) inter-layer Cooper pairs that break the translational symmetry, giving rise to a Kekulé (in BBLG) or columnar (in RTLG) pair density wave. Due to the trigonal warping in the normal state, the superconducting ground state produces three-fold rotationally symmetric isolated Fermi rings of normal fermions, which can manifest via linear in temperature scaling of the specific heat. We present scaling of the zero-temperature pairing amplitude and the transition temperature of such pair density wave in the presence of trigonally warped disconnected, annular, and simply connected Fermi rings in the normal state, subject to an effective attractive interaction within a mean-field approximation.</p>

            <h2>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongjin Kim, Cedric Lim, Kirill Matirko, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Michael O. Flynn</p>
            <p>We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.</p>

            <h2>Symmetries, Conservation Laws and Entanglement in Non-Hermitian Fermionic Lattices</h2>

            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.</p>

            <p>We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p>We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Bifurcations in Quantum Circuit Stability from Hidden Parameter Statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pilsung Kang</p>
            <p>The compression of quantum circuits is a foundational challenge for near-term quantum computing, yet the principles governing circuit stability remain poorly understood. We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits. Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of ``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.</p>

            <p>In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.</p>

            <p>We explore a class of dynamical protocols - that we term loop quenches - which are tailored for the study of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) systems. In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus evading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium topology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we introduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes the equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for chiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe measurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our protocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most importantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be extended to other symmetry classes and dimensions.</p>

Here, we propose a tunable platform based on BECs where Josephson oscillations can be engineered and modulated through external electric fields. We develop a theoretical and numerical frame-work that reveals how electric fields affect intercondensate tunneling, phase dynamics, and collective excitations. By employing a coupled set of Gross-Pitaevskii equations with adiabatic elimination of excited states, we demonstrate field-induced tuning of Josephson frequencies and a transition from contact to dipole-dominated regimes. These findings corroborate theoretical predictions about the sensitivity of dipolar BECs to external fields and deepen our understanding of quantum coherence and tunneling in long-range interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We present a proposal for achieving light-induced superconductivity using exciton polaritons - hybrid light-matter particles of excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) and microcavity photons. In contrast to previous theories of polariton-mediated superconductivity, which typically require multiple semiconductor layers, we show that superconductivity can be induced within a single semiconductor monolayer with inverted conduction bands, such as in the tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The key ingredient is that we can resonantly excite exciton polaritons into bands that are different from those occupied by the doped electrons, thus avoiding any Pauli blocking effects. Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron quasiparticles. We find that superconductivity at elevated temperatures is within reach of current experiments.</p>

            <p>Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigated the quasiparticle and spin dynamics in single crystals of bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset temperatures at $\sim$140 K and $\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\rm SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical control.</p>

            <p>The research landscape of magnetism has been recently enriched by the discovery of altermagnetism. It is an unconventional phase of matter characterized by a d-wave (or higher even-parity-wave) collinear compensated spin ordering, which enables strongly spin-polarized currents in the absence of magnetization, and features fast spin dynamics. Simultaneously, on the applied magnetism front, spintronic memories based on conventional ferromagnets are currently turning from a niche to a mass produced integrated-circuit technology as they start to complement semiconductors on advanced-node microprocessor chips. Our review connects these two rapidly developing science and technology fields by discussing how the unique signatures of altermagnetism can impact the functionality and scalability of future spintronic devices. As a reference, we first briefly recall the merits and physical limitations of the present ferromagnetic spintronic technology, and of proof-of-concept spintronic devices based on conventional collinear antiferromagnets and non-collinear compensated magnets. The main part of the review then focuses on physical concepts of the altermagnetic spintronics, and its potential interplay with ferroelectricity or superconductivity. We conclude with an outlook on the nascent experimental research of altermagnetic spintronics, and on the role of relativistic phenomena.</p>

            <p>The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.</p>

            <p>We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact, the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2 chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs (chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.</p>

Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT) emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the system-bath coupling strength.

However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can be harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We consider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are smoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary high-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and waiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially, performing 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization of a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented using static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct implementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing control overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures.</p>

            <h2>Emergent gauge flux in QED$_3$ with flavor chemical potential: application to magnetized U(1) Dirac spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Chen, Urban F. P. Seifert, Kexin Feng, Oleg A. Starykh, Leon Balents, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>We design a lattice model of non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.</p>

            <h2>Emergent dynamical Kondo coherence and competing magnetic order in a correlated kagome flat-band metal CsCr6Sb6</h2>

            <p>Correlated kagome metals host unique electronic states that enable exotic quantum phenomena. In the recently emerged CsCr6Sb6, these manifest through Kondo behavior from localized Cr-3d electrons and unprecedented band flattening near the Fermi level. Yet the intricate interplay among Kondo screening, magnetic frustration, and electronic correlations remains poorly understood-a fundamental gap we address through multifaceted experimental and theoretical approaches. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal electronic correlation-renormalized flat bands and muon spin relaxation study detect short-range magnetic order at TN ~ 80 K. Complementing these findings, density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations identify a coherent-incoherent crossover at TN, with a remarkable restoration of coherence accompanying local moment suppression-an anomalous hallmark of Kondo behavior. Intriguingly, despite strong interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling, the system evades long-range magnetic order due to competing magnetic configurations separated by sub-meV energy differences. These insights establish CsCr6Sb6 as a prototypical platform for investigating dynamical Kondo screening in correlated flat-band systems, opening new avenues to study flat band physics and frustrated magnetism in correlated kagome lattices.</p>

            <h2>Lifshitz transition in correlated topological semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byungkyun Kang, Myoung-Hwan Kim, Chul Hong Park, Anderson Janotti, Eunja Kim</p>
            <p>Topological quasiparticles, arising when the chemical potential is near the band crossing, are pivotal for the development of next-generation quantum devices. They are expected to exist in half-Heusler correlated topological semimetals. However, the emergence of hole carriers, which alter the chemical potential away from the quadratic-band-touching points is not yet understood. Here, we investigated the electronic structure of YPtBi and GdPtBi through ab initio many-body perturbation GW theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory and revealed that the correlation effects of 4$d$ or 4$f$ electrons can lead to the formation of hole carriers. In YPtBi, the weakly correlated Y-4$d$ electrons constitute the topological bands, and the quadratic-band-touching point is at the Fermi level at high temperatures. At low temperatures, enhanced correlations of Y-4$d$ renormalize the topological bands, leading to the formation of hole pocket. In GdPtBi, the strongly correlated Gd-4$f$ electrons form the Hubbard-like bands originate from self-energy effects associated with a topological singularity. These local bands encompass itinerant 4$f$ bands, which hybridize with topological bands to induce pronounced hole bands. This concerted effect reduces the hole doping, bringing the chemical potential closer to the quadratic-band-touching points as the temperature is lowered. The temperature-induced Lifshitz transition should be responsible for the large hole bands observed in both topological semimetals in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements at low temperatures. Our findings indicate that the integration of correlated fermions within a topological framework can modulate the energy landscape of topological bands.</p>

            <h2>Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in a Honeycomb Spiral Spin-Liquid Candidate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqian Zhao, Xun Chen, Zongtang Wan, Zhaohua Ma, Yuesheng Li</p>
            <p>Unlike conventional magnetic states, which lack degeneracy, the spiral spin liquid (SSL) fluctuates among degenerate spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized ferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and decalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic cooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the magnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a spin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $<$ $H_\mathrm{c}$ ($\mu_0H_\mathrm{c}$ $\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the honeycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\sim$2 K). For $H$ $\geq$ $H_\mathrm{c}$, GdZnPO enters a polarized non-degenerate ferromagnetic state. Our results demonstrate that GdZnPO exhibits a giant low-temperature magnetocaloric effect near $H_\mathrm{c}$, surpassing other magnetocaloric materials. This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated honeycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below $H_\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures. Additionally, its magnetic cooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\sim$36 mK through cycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures, constructed by stacking two-dimensional materials, have enabled the study of interlayer coupling between different materials. One example is the formation of interlayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. The integration of 2D sliding ferroelectric materials introduces new opportunities for manipulating excitonic properties in these systems. In this work, we investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body calculations. Photoluminescence spectroscopy at low temperature reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric environment changes. Additionally, local variations in photoluminescence energy correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton behavior. Gate voltage experiments further demonstrate tunable shifts in interlayer exciton energy, driven by switching ferroelectric domains. These results highlight the potential of interlayer excitons being controlled by local ferroelectric polarization and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We report quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance that are periodic in magnetic field ($B$), observed at the interface between (La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. Unlike Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ > 7$ T and diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The relatively long phase coherence length ($\sim$ 1.8 $\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic interferometers and quantum sensors.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling orbital optical chirality through multipolar chiral light-matter interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shun Hashiyada, An'an Wu, Yoshito Y. Tanaka</p>
            <p>Chiral light-matter interactions have traditionally been understood in terms of electric-magnetic dipolar interference driven by light with spin angular momentum. Here, we show that optical chirality can also originate from the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, giving rise to higher-order multipolar chiral responses. Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused circularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular momenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral dichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes, revealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM. The spectra reveal clear quadrupole resonances whose spectral profile is strongly modulated by the OAM sign, demonstrating an OAM-driven chiral interaction. Crucially, the signal satisfies optical reciprocity, ruling out artefacts from anisotropy or misalignment and confirming its nature as a true chiral response. Angular momentum dissipation analysis further shows that orbital contributions dominate over spin. These findings establish the existence of a distinct form of optical chirality, referred to as orbital optical chirality, which opens new avenues for probing and controlling multipolar chiral light-matter interactions beyond the dipolar paradigm.</p>

            <p>Topological band theory has expanded into various domains in applied physics, offering significant potential for future technologies. Recent developments indicate that unique bulk band topology perceived for electrons can be realized in a system of light-matter quasiparticles with reduced crystal symmetry utilizing tunable light-matter interaction. In this work we realize topologically non-trivial energy band dispersion of exciton-polaritons confined in two-dimensional anisotropic materials inside an optical microcavity, and show the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) due to non-Hermitian topology arising from excitonic dipole oscillators with finite quasiparticle lifetime. Fourier-plane imaging reveals two pairs of EPs connected by bulk Fermi arcs for each of the transverse electric and magnetic polarized modes. An anisotropic Lorentz oscillator model captures the exact band dispersion observed in our experiment in two-dimensional momentum space. Our findings establish anisotropic two-dimensional materials as a platform for exploring non-Hermitian topological physics, with implications for polarization-controlled optical technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long Zhang, Guangxin Ni, Junjie He, Guoying Gao</p>
            <p>Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.</p>

            <p>Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.</p>

            <p>Gapless fracton quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter described by higher-rank U(1) gauge theories which host gapped and immobile fracton matter excitations as well as gapless photons. Despite well-known field theories, no spin models beyond purely classical systems have been identified to realize these phases. Using error-controlled Green function Monte Carlo, here we investigate a square lattice spin-1 model that shows precise signatures of a fracton quantum spin liquid without indications of conventional ordering. Specifically, the magnetic response exhibits characteristic patterns of suppressed pinch points that accurately match the prediction of a rank-2 U(1) field theory and reveals the existence of emergent photon excitations in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Remarkably, this type of fracton quantum spin liquid is not only identified in the system's ground state but also in generic low-energy sectors of a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes. Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.</p>

The triplet SQUID undergoes nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets are a novel class of materials that combine antiferromagnetic spin ordering with non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in their band structure, making them promising candidates for spintronics applications without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional bilayer Mott insulator that exhibits altermagnetic order. The interplay between spin and layer degrees of freedom gives rise to a complex symmetry-breaking pattern involving both magnetic and interlayer-coherent components. A key control parameter in the system is the layer polarization, which can be tuned via an external gate voltage. We show that applying an in-plane electric field with opposite signs in the two layers induces a polarization current that drives a spin current in each layer. While the polarization current is isotropic, the resulting spin current exhibits strong anisotropy and can be reversed by adjusting the photon energy. These findings suggest new avenues for manipulating spin transport in altermagnetic systems via electric and optical means.</p>

            <p>Excitons in organic materials are emerging as an attractive platform for tunable quantum technologies. Structures with near-degenerate doublet and triplet excitations in linked trityl radical, acene and carbazole units can host quartet states. These high spin states can be coherently manipulated, and later decay radiatively via the radical doublet transition. However, this requires controlling the deexcitation pathways of all metastable states. Here we establish design rules for efficient quartet generation in luminescent radicals, using different connection arrangements of the molecular units. We discover that electronic coupling strength between these units dictates luminescence and quartet formation yields, particularly through the energetics of an acene-radical charge transfer state, which we tune Coulombically. This state acts as a source of non-radiative decay when acene-radical separation is small, but facilitates doublet-quartet spin interconversion when acene-radical separation is large. Using these rules we report a radical-carbazole-acene material with 55% luminescence yield, where 94% of emitting excitons originate from the quartet at microsecond times. This reveals the central role of molecular topology in luminescent quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngjae Kim</p>
            <p>The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</p>

            <p>Understanding the nature of collective charge dynamics in the Coulomb gap phase is essential for revealing the existence of many-body localization. However, the corresponding many-particle excitation spectra remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of $^{27}$Al and $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (NMR/NQR), along with specific heat ($C_p$) measurements, in the $p$-type semiconductor CuAlO$_2$. Our study unveils distinct changes in charge dynamics at two crossover temperature scales which separate three regimes associated with Anderson localization of charge carriers: thermally activated transport ($T>150$ K) $\rightarrow$ Mott variable-range hopping (VRH) $\rightarrow$ Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH with Coulomb gap formation ($T<50$ K). In the ES VRH regime, we observe a striking divergence in the zero-field $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, $(T_1T)^{-1}$, which is strongly suppressed by an applied magnetic field, indicative of quantum critical charge fluctuations. This is further supported by a distinct magnetic field-dependence of $C_p/T$ deep within the Coulomb gap phase. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the emergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson insulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.</p>

Moreover, distinct edge states, independent of step geometry and exhibiting a broad spatial distribution, are observed at ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$ step edges, underscoring its topological nature.</p>

            <h2>Asymmetric-gate Mach--Zehnder interferometry in graphene: Multi-path conductance oscillations and visibility characteristics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taegeun Song, Nojoon Myoung</p>
            <p>Graphene provides an excellent platform for investigating electron quantum interference due to its outstanding coherent properties. In the quantum Hall regime, Mach--Zehnder (MZ) electronic interferometers are realized using p--n junctions in graphene, where electron interference is highly protected against decoherence. In this work, we present a phenomenological framework for graphene-based MZ interferometry with asymmetric p--n junction configurations. We show that the enclosed interferometer area can be tuned by asymmetric gate potentials, and additional MZ pathways emerge in higher-filling-factor scenarios, e.g. $\left(\nu_{n},\nu_{p}\right)=\left(-3,+3\right)$. The resulting complicated beat oscillations in asymmetric-gate MZ interference are efficiently analyzed using a machine-learning--based Fourier transform, which yields improved peak-to-background ratios compared to conventional signal-processing techniques. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the asymmetric gate on the interference visibility, finding that interference visibility is enhanced under symmetric gate conditions.</p>

            <h2>Supercritical fluids as a distinct state of matter characterized by sub-short-range structural order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sha Jin, Xinyang Li, Xue Fan, Matteo Baggioli, Yuliang Jin</p>
            <p>A supercritical fluid (SCF)--the state of matter at temperatures and pressures above the critical point--exhibits properties intermediate between those of a liquid and a gas. However, whether it constitutes a fundamentally distinct phase or merely a continuous extension of the liquid and gas states remains an open question. Here we show that a SCF is defined by sub-short-range (SSR) structural order in the spatial arrangement of particles, setting it apart from the gas (disordered), liquid (short-range ordered), and solid (long-range ordered) states. The SSR structural order can be characterized by a length scale effectively quantified by the number of observable peaks in the radial distribution function. This length grows from a minimum microscopic value, on the order of the inter-particle distance at the gas-SCF boundary, to a diverging value at the SCF-liquid boundary. Based on the emergence of SSR order, we demonstrate that the transport and dynamical properties of the SCF state, including the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity autocorrelation function, also clearly distinguish it from both the liquid and gas states. Theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics simulations of argon and further supported by existing experimental evidence. Our study confirms and assigns physical significance to the refined phase diagram of matter in the supercritical region, consisting of three distinct states (gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid) separated by two crossover boundaries that follow universal scaling laws.</p>

            <p>It has long been taken for granted that there is only one type of thermodynamic system near absolute zero temperature: the ordinary one compatible with all statements of the third law, with a fundamental yet tacit assumption that all heat capacities in the system vanish as absolute temperature approaches zero. However, in the strict sense, the statements are not mutually equivalent. Once the tacit assumption is released, the inequivalence must remain, and we may have some systems that are only compatible with one or two statements but not all, defining a singular zero-temperature system which can never be excluded from physical feasibility. We revisit some previously proposed theoretical models and identify that they belong to the singular system.</p>

            <h2>A Spin Glass Characterization of Neural Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Li</p>
            <p>This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection, safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>The Raman scattering response of the biaxial antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$ has been investigated as a function of both magnetic field and temperature. The peaks observed in the low-frequency spectral range (90--200~cm$^{-1}$) have been identified as hybrid magnon--phonon excitations. The energies of the bare magnon and phonon modes, as well as the effective coupling strengths between different excitation pairs, have been determined. The strong and selective magnon--phonon interaction largely accounts for the pronounced splitting of two phonon-like modes observed at 152~cm$^{-1}$ and 158~cm$^{-1}$ in the antiferromagnetic phase of CoPS$_3$. Based on the identification of bare magnon excitations and their magnetic-field dependence, we propose an updated set of parameters for the effective exchange ($J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 9.9$~meV) and biaxial magnetic anisotropy ($D = 4.3$~meV and $E = -0.7$~meV) and advocate for an apparent anisotropic $g$-factor ($g_x = g_y = 2$, $g_z = 4$) in the CoPS$_3$ antiferromagnet.</p>

            <p>The LnSbTe family is well known for hosting a plethora of intriguing characteristics stemming from its crystalline symmetry, magnetic structure, 4f electronic correlations and spin orbit coupling (SOC) phenomena. In this paper, we have systematically studied the bulk electrical and thermodynamic properties and electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) corroborated with first principles based theoretical band structure calculations with and without considering the effect of SOC, a critical factor dictating the band degeneracy which depends on the choice of the Ln atom. Corroborative temperature dependent susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements, coherently exhibit paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition approximately at 1.94 K, and another sharp anomaly at 1.75 K. The zero field cooled resistivity measurement does not show the characteristic hump like feature in the other LnSbTe materials. The electronic band structure of ErSbTe, exhibits a diamond shaped Fermi surface. Along the high symmetry direction GX, electronic bands are projected to cross over the Fermi energy, necessitated by the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the system. The other crossing along this direction is gapped, which evolves along the momentum space reaching its maximum along the GM direction.</p>

            <h2>Effective toughness estimation by FFT based phase field fracture: application to composites and polycrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Aranda, Javier Segurado</p>
            <p>An estimate of the effective toughness of heterogeneous materials is proposed based on the Phase Field Fracture model implemented in an FFT homogenization solver. The estimate is based on the simulation of the deformation of representative volume elements of the microstructure, controlled by a constant energy dissipation rate using an arc-length type control. The definition of the toughness corresponds to the total energy dissipated after the total fracture of the RVE -- which can be accurately obtained thanks to the dissipation control -- divided by the RVE transverse area (length in 2D). The proposed estimate accounts for both the effect of heterogeneity in toughness and elastic response on the overall fracture energy and allows as well to account for phases with anisotropic elastic and fracture response (fracture by cleavage). To improve toughness predictions, crack-tip enrichment is used to model initial cracks. The method is applied to obtain the effective toughness of composites and elastic polycrystals in a series of examples. In the two types of materials, it is found that both heterogeneity in elastic response and fracture energy contribute to increase the effective toughness. Microscopically, it is found that toughening mechanisms are related to the passage of the crack through tougher phases and deviation of the crack path. It is also found that the latter is the controlling mechanism for cases with marked heterogeneity and high anisotropy, eventually provoking toughening saturation for sufficiently high values of heterogeneity or anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Correlated electrons in flat bands: Concepts and Developments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhuparna Karmakar</p>
            <p>When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy, quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries. Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present a Pt decorated ZnO thin film-based gas sensor for hydrogen detection, fabricated using a sputtering technique and an in-situ Pt decoration approach. Specifically, we deposit a ZnO thin film on an interdigitated electrode substrate, with Pt nanoclusters added to the (002) polar plane by brief sputtering (1 to 6 s) to create an active sensing interface. Our sensor demonstrates optimal performance at an operating temperature of 498 K, with rapid response and recovery times (10 and 3 s), high selectivity, and long-term stability. We find the Pt decorated ZnO sensor, with a Pt deposition time of 2 s, to exhibit enhanced response (~52,987%) to 1% hydrogen concentration, indicating its suitability for industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Additionally, our device demonstrates reliable detection of low hydrogen concentrations (~100 ppb), with a response of ~38% and no response drift over one year of testing, underscoring the long-term stability of the sensor. To elucidate the role of Pt deposition and pristine ZnO in hydrogen sensing, we perform density functional theory calculations, analysing adsorption and reaction energetics involving H2, O2, O, OH, and H2O, and lattice oxygen atoms on the ZnO (002) surface with and without Pt decoration. Our computational data is in agreement with our experiments, identifying the oxygen-exposed (002) surface to be most active for hydrogen sensing in both pristine and Pt decorated ZnO. Further, our computations highlight the role of Pt in enhancing hydrogen sensitivity via i) activating an autoreduction pathway of adsorbed OH, ii) spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed molecular H2, and iii) keeping the lattice oxygen pathway of forming H2O active. Our systematic approach of designing sensors combining an experimental setup with theoretical insights, is key in developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen gas sensors.</p>

            <h2>Lack of collisional hydrodynamics in a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline Mauron, Karen V. Kheruntsyan, Giulia De Rosi</p>
            <p>Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model, while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore, we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations, dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic, nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Khalifa, Brian A. Shoemaker, Amir Haji-Akbari</p>
            <p>Ion transport through nanoscale channels and pores is pivotal to numerous natural processes and industrial applications. Experimental investigation of the kinetics and mechanisms of such processes is, however, hampered by the limited spatiotemporal resolution of existing experimental techniques. While molecular simulations have become indispensable for unraveling the underlying principles of nanoscale transport, they also suffer from some important technical limitations. In our previous works, we identified strong polarization-induced finite-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of hindered ion transport, caused by spurious long-range interactions between the traversing ion and the periodic replicates of other ions. To rectify these artifacts, we introduced the Ideal Conductor/Dielectric Model (\textsc{Icdm}), which treats the system as a combination of conductors and dielectrics, and constructs an analytical correction to the translocation free energy profile. Here, we investigate some limitations of this model. Firstly, we propose a generalized approach based on Markov State models that is capable of estimating translocation timescales in the thermodynamic limit for free energy profiles with multiple comparable barriers. Second, we identify a new category of polarization-induced finite-size effects, which significantly alter the spatial distribution of non-traversing ions in smaller systems. These secondary effects cannot be corrected by the ICDM model and must be avoided by selecting sufficiently large system sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate through multiple case studies that finite-size artifacts can reverse expected trends in ion transport kinetics. Our findings underscore the necessity for careful selection of system sizes and the judicious application of the \textsc{Icdm} model to rectify residual finite-size artifacts.</p>

            <p>We study the effect of symmetry-breaking perturbations in the multiorbital Hubbard model coupled to anisotropic Jahn-Teller phonons, which is relevant for the description of fulleride superconductors. This system is often approximated by a model with static antiferromagnetic (AFM) Hund's coupling, in which the coupling to the Jahn-Teller phonon is effectively described, but the retardation effect associated with phonon propagation is neglected. We compare the properties of the models with static AFM Hund's coupling and dynamical Jahn-Teller electron-phonon interaction by means of the Eliashberg theory. Considering the susceptibilities for the spin, magnetic orbital, electric orbital, and superconductivity, we reveal a qualitatively different behavior between the two models in the case of the magnetic orbital susceptibility. We further study the effect of a magnetic field on the $s$-wave spin-singlet superconducting state. In the presence of the field, the magnetic orbital susceptibility becomes nonzero due to a combination of multiorbital and retardation effects, while the spin susceptibility remains zero at low temperatures. By analyzing this phenomenon both numerically and analytically, we clarify that odd-frequency pairs induced by the magnetic field play a crucial role in the spin and orbital magnetic susceptibilities. Thus, the magnetic degrees of freedom produce interesting behaviors in the presence of retardation effects associated with electron-phonon coupling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Pollack, Rohan Maniar, John P. Perdew</p>
            <p>Density functional theory (DFT) is a widespread and effective tool in electronic structure calculations for ground-state electron systems. Its success has prompted exploration into the use of DFT for non-collective excited states. The delta self-consistent field ($\Delta$SCF) method allows for the extension of DFT to excited-state energies by restricting the Kohn-Sham orbital occupations, producing an excited-state electron density, and then computing its energy. In this paper, we examine the performance of the LSDA, PBE generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), and SCAN/r2SCAN meta-GGA for the excitation energies of several important systems. We consider the energies of atoms with atomic number 1-18. For the hydrogen atom, where we use the exact electron density and have no multiplet splitting, we find significant improvement up the ladder from LSDA to PBE to SCAN. For the uniform gas, we find an effective mass different from the bare mass only with r2SCAN. We split the case of multi-electron atoms into non-aufbau excitations, where the highest-energy electron is excited to the lowest state in the next nl subshell (where accuracy is least limited by available basis sets), and spin-flip excitations, where the spin of an electorn is flipped, leading to a higher-energy state of the same nl configuration. We find reasonably accurate approximate excitation energies, except for the spin-flip cases where the auxiliary non-interacting wavefunction of a non-Hund's-rule spin state is not well-described by a single determinant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoliang Zhang, Haechan Park</p>
            <p>Electron spin qubits operating at atomic clock transitions exhibit exceptionally long coherence times, making them promising candidates for scalable quantum information applications. In solid-state systems, interactions between qubits and lattice phonons are known to play a critical role in spin relaxation (T1) and decoherence (T2). In this work, we perform first-principles calculations on a Lu(II) complex spin qubit featuring a prominent clock transition. By employing advanced electronic structure methods, we quantitatively evaluate the influence of phonons on the hyperfine interaction, which serves as the primary spin-lattice coupling mechanism. Treating these phonon-induced variations as first-order perturbations, we apply the Redfield master equation to compute both T1 and T2, along with their temperature dependencies. For T1, we adopt a second quantization formalism to describe phonon interactions, while T2 is evaluated by explicitly integrating acoustic phonon contributions across the full Brillouin zone. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of T2, including the coherence peak near 0.43 T, though the absolute values of T1 and T2 differ by one to two orders of magnitude. Analysis reveals that T1 is primarily governed by longitudinal phonons, whereas T2 is most strongly influenced by mid-wavelength, mid-energy acoustic modes. These findings provide a quantitative demonstration of the clock transition protective effect on spin qubit coherence and offer a transferable computational framework for evaluating spin-phonon interactions in other molecular spin qubits.</p>

            <p>Selenium (Se) has reemerged as a promising absorber material for indoor and tandem photovoltaics (PVs), and its alloys with Te (Se1-xTex) offer a widely tunable bandgap. Solution processing of this materials system offers a route to low-cost fabrication. However, solution processing of Se has, thus far, only used hydrazine, which is an extremely hazardous solvent. In this work, we prepare and isolate propylammonium poly-Se and poly-Se-Te precursors from a safer thiol-amine solvent system. We formulate molecular inks by dissolving the precursor n,n-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a monoethanolamine (EA) additive and process high-quality Se and Se1-xTex films with bandgaps ranging from 1.20 eV to 1.86 eV. We fabricate PVs from these films using TiO2 and MoO3 charge transport layers (CTLs) to achieve power conversion efficiencies as high as 2.73% for Se and 2.33% for Se0.7Te0.3 under solar simulation. Se devices show excellent stability with no degradation after 1 month in air, enabled by the excellent stability of Se and the use of inorganic CTLs. This work represents an important step towards low-cost solution-phase processing of Se and Se1-xTex alloys for PVs and photodetectors with low toxicity and high bandgap tunability.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>The Pauli limiting field of superconductors determines the maximal possible value of magnetic field at which superconductivity remains possible. For weak-coupling superconductors, it is determined by an established relation that can be found by setting the condensation energy equal to the magnetization free energy. The latter is a function of the carrier g-factor. Here, we demonstrate in a van der Waals superconductor PdTe2, that quantum confinement can tune the effective g-factor causing the Pauli limit to become thickness dependent. We experimentally probe the in-plane upper critical field (Hc2||) of PdTe2 at intermediate thicknesses down to 20mK. Hc2|| is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude as the thickness is varied from 50nm down to 19nm. We model its temperature and thickness dependence, revealing that both orbital and spin Zeeman depairing mechanisms impact its value. While the variation of the orbital interaction is expected, our findings reveal how the Zeeman interaction impacts superconductivity in thin films. They aid in the search for mixed and odd pairing superconductivity where an enhancement of Hc2|| can be occasionally associated with those unconventional pairing symmetries.</p>

            <p>Understanding the mechanism of spin switching in ferrimagnets via the excitation of THz pulses holds promise for future-generation magnetic memory devices. Such spin switching can be accomplished by the Zeeman torque exerted by the THz pulses on the magnetic spins. Theoretical and experimental works have established that the field-derivative of a terahertz pulse also exerts a torque, field derivative torque (FDT). Here, we investigate the role of the FDT in the spin switching in ferrimagnetic Gd$_{3/2}$Yb$_{1/2}$BiFe$_5$O$_{12}$ using a computational approach. Our results foresee that the spin switching in the presence of the FDT requires less THz magnetic fields than the spin switching without the FDT. Without the FDT terms, the spin switching in the considered system requires an extremely high magnetic field. Furthermore, we compute the switching and non-switching contour diagrams to show that the FDT tremendously enhances the possibility of spin switching. These results not only shed light on the significance of the FDT in magnetization switching but also suggest materials where the switching effect is pronounced.</p>

            <p>Accurately modeling interfacial thermal transport in van der Waals heterostructures is challenging due to the limited availability of interlayer interaction potentials. We develop a pairwise interlayer potential for graphene/germanene van der Waals heterostructure using the binding energy obtained from ab-initio density functional theory calculations and use it to calculate the interfacial thermal conductivity. Our calculations reveal that the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance to $\sim$136% of the unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite effect, reducing the conductance to $\sim$70% of the unstrained value. Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the interfacial thermal conductance for both directions of heat flow.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dameul Jeong, Seoung-Hun Kang, Young-Kyun Kwon</p>
            <p>Altermagnets, which reconcile zero net magnetization with pronounced spin splitting, offer fresh opportunities for spin-based functionalities in next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. In this paper, we explore the unconventional spin Hall conductivity (USHC) in three prototypical altermagnets -- RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe -- and elucidate how distinct magnetic and crystal symmetries modulate their spin Hall responses. RuO$_2$ exhibits only trivial USHC contributions under a tilted geometry, demonstrating that symmetry projections alone can induce apparent unconventional elements. In contrast, CrSb and MnTe manifest robust, symmetry-driven USHC without structural tilts, enabled by easy-axis orientations that reduce magnetic symmetry. Through extensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the complementary roles of the time-reversal-even and time-reversal-odd components in determining the overall SHC. Our findings indicate that controlling the interplay between crystal and magnetic symmetry -- for instance, by epitaxial strain or doping -- can provide an experimental avenue to tune USHC magnitudes and directions in altermagnets. These results pave the way for the engineering of multifunctional spintronic devices, where enhanced coherence and robust spin transport are realized in zero-net-moment materials with easily tailored spin configurations.</p>

            <h2>Proximate spin-liquid behavior in the double trillium lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$</h2>

            <p>We report proximate quantum spin liquid behavior in K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ with the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions embedded on a highly frustrated three-dimensional double trillium lattice. Single-crystal and high-resolution synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition at $T_{\rm t} \simeq 125$ K from high-temperature cubic to low-temperature monoclinic phase with the three-fold superstructure. Magnetization and heat capacity consistently show the formation of the $J_{\rm eff} =1/2$ state of Co$^{2+}$ below 50 K. In zero field, K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ shows signatures of static magnetic order formed below $T^* \simeq 0.6$ K, but muon spin relaxation experiments reveal a large fluctuating component that persists down to at least 50 mK, reminiscent of quantum spin liquid (QSL). Static order is completely suppressed in the small magnetic field of $\sim 1$ T, and low-temperature heat capacity demonstrates the $T^2$ behavior above this field, another fingerprint of QSL. Ab initio calculations show a competition of several antiferromagnetic couplings that render K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ a promising pseudospin-$\frac12$ material for studying quantum magnetism in the double trillium lattice geometry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirokazu Fujiwara, Yuki Itoya, Masaharu Kobayashi, Cédric Bareille, Toshiyuki Taniuchi</p>
            <p>We have developed an operando laser-based photoemission electron microscope (laser-PEEM) with a ferroelectric characterization system. A Sawyer-Tower circuit was implemented to measure the polarization-voltage ($P-V$) characteristics of ferroelectric devices. Using this system, we successfully obtained the well-defined $P-V$ hysteresis loops for a ferroelectric capacitor incorporating Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO), reproducing the typical field-cycling characteristics of HZO capacitors. After dielectric breakdown caused by field-cycling stress, we visualized a conduction filament through the top electrode without any destructive processing. Additionally, we successfully observed polarization contrast through the top electrode of an oxide semiconductor (InZnO$_x$). These results indicate that our operando laser-PEEM system is a powerful tool for visualizing conduction filaments after dielectric breakdown, the ferroelectric polarization contrasts, and electronic state distribution of materials implemented in ferroelectric devices, including ferroelectric field-effect transistors and ferroelectric tunnel junctions.</p>

            <h2>Doping $S=1$ antiferromagnet in one-dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Prokopczyk, J. Herbrych</p>
            <p>Antiferromagnetic ground states, when doped, give rise to rich and complex phenomena, prompting detailed investigations in various spin systems. Here, we study the effect of doping on the one-dimensional $S = 1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (AFM). Specifically, we investigate how the presence of holes affects the static and dynamic (frequency-dependent) spin-spin correlations of the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori chain. The latter, at half-filling and in the limit of strong interactions, maps onto an $S = 1$ Heisenberg model. For moderate interactions, an orbital resonating-valence-bond (orbital-RVB) state emerges up to doping levels of $x \lesssim 0.4$. A detailed analysis of interaction strength $U$ and doping concentration $x$ reveals that this phase inherits the key features of spin excitations found in the half-filled case -- namely, a gapped spin spectrum and ``coherent'' magnon behavior up to a wavevector $q$ determined by the Fermi vector, $2k_\mathrm{F} = \pi(1 - x)$. Furthermore, our results uncover an additional broad, incoherent spectral weight for $q \gtrsim 2k_\mathrm{F}$ at high frequencies. Finally, we show that near the transition to a ferromagnetic phase, a previously unidentified spiral-like state emerges, characterized by spin excitations reminiscent of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin, retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher E Patrick</p>
            <p>RT\textsubscript{12} materials continue to attract attention due to their potential use as ``rare-earth-lean'' permanent magnets, but converting their promising intrinsic properties into practical high performance remains an elusive goal. Sophisticated experimental characterization techniques are providing unprecedented insight into the structure of these materials at the atomistic scale. Atomistic spin dynamics or micromagnetics simulations could help unravel the links between these structures and resultant magnet performance, but require input data describing the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory are used to determine these properties for two model interface structures which have been derived from recently reported high resolution electron microscopy images. One model structure is a stoichiometric twin formed by mirroring the RT\textsubscript{12} structure in the (101) plane, and the other model structure is a ``stacking fault'' involving the insertion of a RT\textsubscript{4} plane and a displacement along the [100] axis. Magnetic moments and crystal field coefficients have been calculated for the optimized structures. The interfaces modify the magnetic properties at the sub-nm scale. In particular, in the R-rich region of the ``stacking fault'', the local easy axis of magnetization rotates by $49^\circ$ from its bulk direction, which may lead to reduced coercivity through the easier nucleation of reverse domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Holly C. M. Baldock, David M. Huang</p>
            <p>Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--Hückel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is a general property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Shen, Shangzhi Song, Tao Chen, Kexin Zhang, Yu Chen, Lu Zhao, Puqing Jiang</p>
            <p>As integrated circuits continue to scale down and adopt three-dimensional (3D) stacking, thermal management in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) has emerged as a critical design constraint. In this study, we present a combined experimental and simulation framework to quantitatively characterize and mechanistically understand thermal transport in BEOL multilayers. Using the Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) method, a time-resolved optical metrology technique, we measure cross-plane thermal resistance and areal heat capacity in semiconductor chips at nanometer resolution. Two fabricated chip samples, polished to the M4 and M6 interconnection layers, are analyzed to extract thermal properties of distinct multilayer stacks. Results show that thermal resistance follows a series model, while areal heat capacity scales linearly with metal content. To uncover the underlying physical mechanisms, we perform finite element simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics, examining the influence of via connectivity and dielectric thermal conductivity on effective cross-plane heat transport. The simulations reveal that dielectric materials, due to their large volume fraction, are the primary limiting factor in BEOL thermal conduction, while the via structure plays a secondary but significant role. This combined experimental-simulation approach provides mechanistic insight into heat transport in advanced IC architectures and offers practical guidance for optimizing thermal pathways in future high-performance 3D-stacked devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng Li, Pengfei Danga, Yuehui Xiana, Yumei Zhou, Bofeng Shi, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Suna, Dezhen Xue</p>
            <p>The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs. Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal hysteresis of 29 °C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.</p>

            <p>We present an analytical study of the ground-state phase diagram for dilute two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi gases exhibiting $d$-wave altermagnetic spin splitting under $s$-wave pairing. Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field framework, four distinct phases are identified: a Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper-type superfluid, a normal metallic phase, a nodal superfluid with topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (TBFSs), and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states with finite center-of-mass momentum. Among these, the FFLO states and TBFSs exemplify two unconventional forms of superconductivity. Considering the simplicity of this model, with only one band, zero net magnetization, and $s$-wave paring, the emergence of both unconventional phases underscores the pivotal role of altermagnetic spin splitting in enabling exotic pairing phenomena. This analytical study not only offers a valuable benchmark for future numerical simulations, but also provides a concrete experimental roadmap for realizing FFLO states and TBFSs in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals enable the observation of bulk magnetism in topological quantum phases. We report site-selective NMR spectroscopy that probes local static and dynamic spin susceptibility on the magnetic semimetal BaMnBi$_2$. We find that spontaneous staggered fields from antiferromagnetic Mn moments are completely canceled at the Bi layer hosting Dirac fermions. In an in-plane field, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows the cubic temperature dependence to low temperatures, manifesting the ideal Dirac semimetal with chemical potential close to the Dirac point. In an out-of-plane field, $1/T_1$ becomes a constant below 20 K, where the Laudau level appears, and is enhanced more than 100 times larger than under the in-plane field. The result demonstrates a condensation of quantized Dirac fermions in the quantum Hall regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prashant Singh, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of a $\textit{Sokoban random walker}$ moving in a disordered medium with obstacle density $\rho$. In contrast to the classic model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average trap size as a proxy, we identify a new trapping transition that replaces the classical percolation transition. This transition occurs at a threshold density $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ and separates two qualitatively distinct trapping regimes: a self-trapping regime at low density, where the walker becomes dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping regime at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement of obstacles.</p>

            <p>Copper-based catalysts are of particular interest for electrochemical reduction of CO$_2$ (CO2RR) as products beyond CO can form. To improve activity and selectivity, several studies have focused on the addition of other elements as substitutional impurities. Although the adsorption of a single CO molecule has often been used as a descriptor for CO2RR activity, our recent calculations using the RPBE functional showed that multiple CO molecules can bind to first-row transition metal impurities. Here, we extend the study to second-row transition metals and also to a functional that explicitly includes dispersion interaction, BEEF-vdW. The binding energy of the first CO molecule on the impurity atom is found to be significantly larger than on the clean Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces, but the differential binding energy generally drops as more CO molecules adsorb. The dispersion interaction is found to make a significant contribution to the binding energy, in particular for the last and weakest bound CO molecule, the one that is most likely to participate in CO2RR. In some cases, four CO admolecules can bind more strongly on the impurity atom than on the clean copper surface. The adsorption of CO causes the position of the impurity atom to shift outwards and in some cases, even escape from the surface layer. The C-O stretch frequencies are calculated in order to identify possible experimental signatures of multiple CO adsorption.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered heliconical ferroelectric nematic (NTBF) phase is a unique example of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a proper ferroelectric fluid. In this study, we investigate four homologous series of mesogenic compounds, differing in the degree of fluorination of the mesogenic core and bearing lateral alkoxy substituents of varying lengths, to understand how molecular architecture influences the formation and stability of the NTBF phase. Increasing the length of the lateral chain lowers the phase transition temperatures and suppresses smectic layer formation, enabling the emergence of the NTBF phase which replaces the orthogonal ferroelectric smectic A (SmAF) phase. This indicates a competition between lamellar and heliconical polar ordering, driven by the interplay of strong molecular dipoles and the self-segregation of chemically incompatible molecular segments that typically favor layered structures. Notably, the NTBF phase in these compounds exhibits exceptionally short helical pitch lengths, on the order of a few hundred nanometers, as revealed by selective light reflection and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, for one of the studied compounds AFM imaging of one compound revealed a regular array of screw dislocations within the NTBF phase, suggesting a possible link to more complex modulated or twist-grain-boundary-like structures.</p>

            <p>Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is the representative solid state defect qubit for quantum information science, offering long coherence time at room temperature. To achieve high sensitivity and spatial resolution, shallow NV center near the surface are preferred. However, shallow NV center suffers from surface states and spin noise which reduce the photostability and coherence time. In this work, we systematically study the NV center in recently reported two-dimensional diamond, known as diamane--using first-principles calculations. We show that the quantum confinement in finite-layer diamane, with appropriate surface passivation, could significantly modify the band structure. In particular, we identify oxygen surface termination capable of hosting NV center in diamane while optimizing photostability compared to bulk diamond. Furthermore, layer-dependent NV center demonstrates tunable zero-phonon-line and suppressed phonon side band, while retaining long coherence time. Our findings highlight diamane as a promising platform for NV-based quantum information processing with improved optical properties and stability</p>

            <p>Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics, combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.</p>

            <p>Generation of squeezed light is usually implemented in nonlinear \c{hi}(2) or \c{hi}(3) materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also offer non-linearities but they differ from passive elements in that they add amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE). In a semiconductor laser, squeezing to below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity and it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to squeezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but often the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier. At the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a quantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise squeezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area. The noise in the present experiments does not reach the quantum limit so we term this condition quasi squeezing. It occurs during the portions of the Rabi cycle when the quantum dots provide gain and repeats with every fourfold increase of the pulse excitation energy which amounts to a 2{\pi} increase in pulse area. In all other cases, the noise exhibits the properties of a coherent state.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices, heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching, which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes, limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.</p>

            <p>In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this paper, we analyze the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio. Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators, modify them for 1D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results. Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our approach.</p>

Instead, we measured the nonlinear gain of stimulated Brillouin scattering to provide additional information for mass density estimation. This all-optical method reduces the estimation error tenfold, offering a more accurate and universal technique for mass density measurements.</p>

            <p>Understanding the electronic structure of transition-metal dopants in IV-VI semiconductors is critical for tuning their band structure. We analyze properties of Cr dopant in $Pb_{1-x}Sn_xTe$ and PbSe by magnetic and transport measurements, which are interpreted based on density functional calculations. We demonstrate that the pinning of the Fermi energy to the chromium resonant level occurs for both n-type and p-type $Pb_{1-x}Sn_xTe$ in the whole composition range. This enables us to determine the valence band and conduction band offsets at the PbTe/SnTe/PbSe heterointerfaces, which is important for designing high-prformance 2D transistors. Furthermore, the magnetic measurements reveal the presence of Cr ions in three charge states, $Cr^{3+}$, $Cr^{2+}$, and $Cr^{1+}$. The last one corresponds to the Cr dopants incorporated at the interstitial, and not the substitutional, sites. The measured concentrations of the interstitial and substitutional Cr are comparable.</p>

            <h2>Sliding Ferroelectric Metal with Ferrimagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenzhou Guo, Xiaodong Zhou, Wenhong Wang, Zhenxiang Cheng, Xiaotian Wang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectric (FE) metals with ferrimagnetism represent a previously unexplored class of spintronic materials, where the interplay of ferroelectricity, metallicity, and magnetism enables strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling and electrically tunable spintronic functionalities. Here, based on antiferromagnetic (AFM) metallic bilayers, we propose a general strategy for constructing 2D sliding FE ferrimagnetic (FiM) metals that can achieve tri-state switching, in which the FE polarization, spin splitting, and net magnetization are reversed simultaneously through FE switching. As a prototypical realization, we design a bilayer sliding FE metal with FiM order, derived from monolayer Fe5GeTe2-a van der Waals metal with intrinsic magnetic order close to room temperature. The system exhibits a FE transition from a nonpolar (NP) AFM phase to a FE FiM phase via interlayer sliding. The in-plane mirror symmetry breaking in FE metallic states lift the spin degeneracy that exists in the NP phase, leading to a sizable net magnetic moment and strong linear ME coupling. The interplay between metallicity and FE FiM gives rise to pronounced sign-reversible transport responses near the Fermi level, all of which can be fully electrically controlled by FE switching without reorienting the Néel order. Our results establish sliding FE metals with FiM as a promising platform for electrically reconfigurable, high-speed, and low-dissipation spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Drag Coefficient in Near-Critical Binary Mixtures: Solving Hydrodynamic Fields with Improved Numerics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunsuke Yabunaka</p>
            <p>We calculate the drag coefficient of a spherical particle suspended in a near-critical binary fluid mixture. To capture the scaling behavior associated with critical adsorption in the strong adsorption regime, we employ the framework of local renormalized functional theory. Previous theoretical studies encountered numerical difficulties when attempting to solve the coupled hydrodynamic and chemical potential equations, expressed as integral equations, for systems with large bulk correlation lengths. These difficulties limited direct comparison with experimental results. In this study, we overcome those limitations by reformulating the hydrodynamic equations as a set of ordinary differential equations using a compactified radial coordinate. This approach enables more stable numerical computation and facilitates the implementation of appropriate boundary conditions at large distances from the particle. As a result, we successfully compute the drag coefficient over a broader range of bulk correlation lengths than in previous works and compare our theoretical predictions with available experimental data.</p>

We analyze thermal stability, linear thermal expansion, and anharmonic heat capacity using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Notably, our work unveils exotic features common among all the 1D wires: a colossal record negative thermal expansion and very large deviations from the Dulong-Petit law due to strong anharmonicity.</p>

            <p>The formation and characteristics of magnetic skyrmions are strongly governed by the symmetry of the underlying crystal structure. In this study, we report the discovery of a new trigonal polymorph of Cu2OSeO3, observed exclusively in nanoparticles. Electron diffraction and density functional theory calculations confirm its R3m space group, sharing C3v symmetry with Néel-type skyrmion hosts. This polymorph is likely stabilized by surface effects, suggesting that size-induced structural changes may drive a transformation from Bloch-type to Neel-type skyrmions in Cu2OSeO3. This hypothesis is consistent with prior unexplained observations of Neel-type skyrmions at the surfaces of bulk crystals, which may result from surface-specific structural distortions. Overall, these findings provide insights into the interplay between size, structure, and magnetism, opening pathways for controlling skyrmionic properties in nanoscale systems.</p>

            <p>Here we report the observation of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconductivity in a BiNi bilayer using terahertz (THz) polarimetry. Leveraging a novel high-precision THz polarimetry technique, we detect, in the superconducting state and at zero magnetic field, the smallest polarization rotation of THz light measured to date. By using the MgO substrate itself as an optical resonator, we can reference the Faraday and Kerr rotations to each other. We observe a low-frequency Kerr rotation on the order of several hundred microradians in the superconducting phase, a clear signature consistent with TRS-breaking superconductivity. Our measurements enable direct access to the THz-range Hall conductivity. Through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, we link these low-energy measurements to prior high-frequency magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) data. This connection provides critical insight into the nature of the TRS-breaking state, supporting a multiband superconducting scenario over a disordered single-band interpretation for the origin of the Kerr effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Hader, Sarah Fleitmann, Jan Vogelbruch, Lotte Geck, Stefan van Waasen</p>
            <p>Quantum dots must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum computation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by fully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the appropriate number of electrons in the quantum dots, typically accomplished by analyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and manually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new approach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible framework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with appropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation to benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom models and parameter sets to drive the development of robust, technology-independent algorithms. Code is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tzu-chen Liu, Steven B. Torrisi, Chris Wolverton</p>
            <p>Short-range order (SRO) in the cation-disordered state is a controlling factor influencing the probability of finding Li$_{4}$ tetrahedron clusters in disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. However, the prevalent Li$_4$ probability below the random limit across reported DRX compositions has not been systematically investigated, active strategies to surpass the random limit of Li$_4$ probability are lacking, and the fundamental ordering behavior on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice remains insufficiently explored. This research quantitatively examines pair SRO parameters and Li$_x$TM$_{4-x}$ probabilities via exhaustive Monte Carlo mapping across a simplified subset of the parameter space. The results indicate that, in the disordered state, the Li$_4$ probability is governed by the nearest neighbor (NN) pair-wise SRO parameter, and that these quantities do not necessarily represent a simple attenuation of their corresponding low-temperature long-range order, particularly for the important cases of Layered and Spinel-like orderings. Strategies are proposed to mitigate or even reverse the lithium and transition metals mixing tendency of NN pair SRO to achieve Li$_4$ probabilities that exceed the random limit. This study advances the fundamental thermodynamic understanding of ordering behaviors, which can be generalized to any FCC system.</p>

            <p>Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shusei Wadashima, Yukitoshi Motome</p>
            <p>Spin liquid and spin glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin-freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remain challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin liquid and spin glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among $p$ spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size $N$ dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of $p$. We show that the phase diagrams for different $p$ can be unified through a scaling with $N/p^2$, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin liquid phase and extends the spin glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin liquid phase transitions into the spin glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide new insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.</p>

            <p>We present a framework for analyzing collections of interacting hysterons through the lens of catastrophe theory. By modeling hysteron dynamics as a gradient system, we show how to construct hysteron transition graphs by characterizing the fold bifurcations of the dynamical system. Transition graphs represent the sequence of hysterons switching states, providing critical insights into the collective behavior of driven disordered media. Extending this analysis to higher codimension bifurcations, such as cusp bifurcations and crossings of fold curves, allows us to map out how the topology of transition graphs changes with variations in system parameters. This approach can suggest strategies for designing metamaterials capable of encoding targeted memory and computational functionalities, but it also highlights the rapid increase of design complexity with system size, further underscoring the computational challenges of controlling large hysteretic systems.</p>

To fill this gap, we propose a measurement protocol based on weak and resonant parameter modulations, and theoretically demonstrate how the local QGT in such systems can be directly probed from changes of the tunnel conductance. This approach enables the measurement of both geometrical and topological features of quantum states in a broad class of transport-based quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases and Their Gauging: A String-Net Model Realization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nianrui Fu, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of $\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach, we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their symmetry constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catherine Ji, Ravin Raj, Benjamin Eysenbach, Gautam Reddy</p>
            <p>Any coarse-grained description of a nonequilibrium system should faithfully represent its latent irreversible degrees of freedom. However, standard dimensionality reduction methods typically prioritize accurate reconstruction over physical relevance. Here, we introduce a model-free approach to identify irreversible degrees of freedom in stochastic systems that are in a nonequilibrium steady state. Our method leverages the insight that a black-box classifier, trained to differentiate between forward and time-reversed trajectories, implicitly estimates the local entropy production rate. By parameterizing this classifier as a quadratic form of learned state representations, we obtain nonlinear embeddings of high-dimensional state-space dynamics, which we term Latent Embeddings of Nonequilibrium Systems (LENS). LENS effectively identifies low-dimensional irreversible flows and provides a scalable, learning-based strategy for estimating entropy production rates directly from high-dimensional time series data.</p>

Using Floquet engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states.

Moreover, we explore the transport properties of the systems subjected to strong disorder or a tilted potential, revealing signatures of anomalous subdiffusion in accompany with the breakdown of thermalization. Our work demonstrates a scalable method of probing infinite-temperature spin transport on analog quantum simulators, which paves the way to study other intriguing out-of-equilibrium phenomena from the perspective of transport.</p>

            <p>Electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials (2DMs) significantly outperform their silicon counterparts; however, silicon CMOS technology remains commercially predominant as it offers the capability to operate dense arrays of devices in a scalable fashion. In particular, graphene Hall sensors (GHSs) offer great improvements in magnetic field sensitivity and resolution compared to silicon Hall-effect sensors, making them extremely appealing for magnetic field imaging and biosensing. At present, GHS arrays have limited scalability compared to silicon CMOS since they require planar routing for biasing and multiplexing. In this work, we explore strategies to realize high-density graphene Hall sensor arrays by vertically connecting GHSs with silicon CMOS biasing and multiplexing circuitry, allowing the routing and circuitry to scale with the array. We investigate the importance of design choices in the chip layout and post-fabrication process in maximizing the reliability of graphene transfer onto mm-scale CMOS dies. Our experimental results validate the success of the integration process by showing for the first time that GHSs can be monolithically integrated with CMOS with high yield to form sensor arrays. We expect that these results will lead to further improvements in magnetic sensing technology and broader advancements in large-scale heterogeneous 2DM-CMOS systems.</p>

            <p>In Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) experiments, the acquisition parameters are generally kept constant throughout the collection of a data set. This limits data collection to one data set at a time, and frequent human interaction is required to maintain the image quality. Here, we use a custom-designed automation interface to minimize such supervision and allow for the collection of multiple interlaced data sets simultaneously. The oscillatory modes of an example catalytic system (hydrogen oxidation over Co foil) were employed as a tunable spatiotemporal test case. Using our automation interface, we can implement more advanced acquisition programs into the microscope that allow dual imaging - effectively bridging reaction monitoring between different length scales. By using automation to change the settings of the acquisition after each frame, we are able to capture alternating magnifications of the same process and sample location. Both a low magnification overview of the mesoscopic surface dynamics and a high magnification field of view of the ongoing structural changes of a selected surface motif were acquired. Using such truly correlative data captured with the dual magnification method, cross-scale correlations about catalytic systems including phase information can be established.</p>

            <p>The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial, unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source, multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments. By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.</p>

Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design.

            <h2>Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Cemin, Markus Schmitt, Marin Bukov</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.</p>

            <h2>Local Diffusion Models and Phases of Data Distributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangjun Hu, Guangkuo Liu, Yifan Zhang, Xun Gao</p>
            <p>As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions, which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers. Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions, the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.</p>

By rewriting core atomistic simulation primitives in PyTorch, TorchSim can achieve orders of magnitude acceleration for popular MLIPs. Unlike existing molecular dynamics packages, which simulate one system at a time, TorchSim performs batched simulations that efficiently utilize modern GPUs by evolving multiple systems concurrently. TorchSim supports molecular dynamics integrators, structural relaxation optimizers, both machine-learned and classical interatomic potentials (such as Lennard-Jones, Morse, soft-sphere), batching with automatic memory management, differentiable simulation, and integration with popular materials informatics tools.</p>

            <h2>Limiting risk to reduce inequality: insights from the Yard-Sale model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lautaro Giordano, Ignacio Cortés, Sebastian Gonçalves, María Fabiana Laguna</p>
            <p>Wealth inequality remains a critical socioeconomic challenge, driven by systemic dynamics and self-reinforcing mechanisms that amplify the economic imbalances. Simplified models from statistical physics provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing wealth distribution. In this study, we extend the Yard-Sale model -- a minimal kinetic exchange framework -- to investigate how limiting risk in economic transactions affects inequality. While previous research demonstrates that such models naturally lead to wealth concentration, we introduce a mechanism that restricts the maximum risk agents can assume during exchanges. Numerical simulations reveal that this modification fosters more equitable wealth distributions and significantly reduces extreme disparities. These findings highlight the importance of individual-level constraints in shaping systemic outcomes, offering new perspectives on promoting economic balance.</p>

            <h2>Wealth Inequality in Agent-Based Economies: The Dominant Role of Social Protection over Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gastón Villafañe, Lautaro Giordano, María Fabiana Laguna</p>
            <p>Persistent wealth inequality, where a small fraction of the population accumulates most resources while the majority remains economically vulnerable, is a widespread phenomenon. We investigate its underlying mechanisms using an agent-based Yard-Sale model that incorporates two complementary features: transaction rules that favor poorer agents, representing social protection policies, and an economic growth process with explicit wealth redistribution. Our results reveal that social protection plays a dominant role in reducing inequality, while redistribution primarily serves to reintegrate excluded agents. These findings suggest that social protection policies, that is, targeted mechanisms favoring economically vulnerable agents, may have a substantially greater impact on reducing inequality than redistribution driven solely by economic growth. We also find that both the shape of the wealth distributions and the resulting inequality levels are strongly influenced by the underlying distribution of individual risk, highlighting the importance of considering agent heterogeneity when modeling economic dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Modeling revolutions in networked societies: learning from the Tunisian spring</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Aguilar-Velázquez, Denis Boyer, Robert Boyer</p>
            <p>Economic competition and deregulation have led to a polarization of societies between a small, increasingly powerful elite and a majority of socially excluded individuals, marginalized and unconnected to political representations. This is the breeding ground for protest movements, relayed by local ties and amplified by social networks. Based on the characteristics revealed by socio-economic research into the Arab revolutions of the 2010s, this article proposes a formalization inspired by the theory of complex systems. We discuss the conditions under which an initial localized event - for example, the suicide of a street vendor condemned to ruin in a small Tunisian town - can trigger an explosion of the number of opponents to the regime, typical of a revolutionary episode. We consider a network model of agents and oppressors where pair interactions are controlled by a fear parameter, or the inclination of the individuals to rebel despite of repression. The model exhibits a phase transition at a critical threshold above which the quiescent state becomes unstable. Furthermore, the ability of individuals to forge triadic relationships accelerates the process of joining a rising rebellion, making the transition more abrupt, in the form of a brutal discontinuity that can be described as revolutionary. The imposition of a counter-revolution by the hardening of repression can be explained by the hysteresis property displayed by the model: when mobilization has extended the initial network and made it partially permanent, repression by the authorities must be tightened to higher levels than before to regain control.</p>

            <h2>Response Theory for Static and Dynamic Solvation of Ionic and Dipolar Solutes in Water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renjie Zhao, Richard C. Remsing, John D. Weeks</p>
            <p>The response of polar solvents to ions and polar molecules dictates many fundamental molecular processes. To understand such electrostatically-driven solvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a solvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in classic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in simulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded point charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to singular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a realistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields its embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However, this core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent density that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In this work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed test charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted anywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite energies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations in the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is linear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for solvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian charges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the theories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian test charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric response in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically predict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar solutes.</p>

            <p>The appearance of angular momentum in the nuclear motion of molecular systems lacking inversion symmetry under imposed thermal gradients presents a novel mechanism with potential implications for spintronics, magnetic response, and energy transport in such systems. Here we explore this phenomenon, using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Liang Tao, Huaxin He, Hao Lyu, Yongping Zhang, Yong Xu</p>
            <p>Nonlinearity enables the emergence of localized waves such as solitons that maintain their shapes during propagation. Solitons are broadly classified into bright and dark solitons. While a bright soliton exhibits a density peak, a dark soliton presents as a defect on a continuous wave background. A distinctive feature of dark solitons is the abrupt phase change in their wave function, which can host Majorana zero modes in topological fermionic superfluids. Recent studies have shown that bright solitons can undergo quantized transport through Thouless pumping, where the bright soliton functions as a Wannier function. However, it remains unclear whether Thouless pumping can also occur for dark solitons, which fundamentally differ from bright solitons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the occurrence of both integer and fractional Thouless pumping for dark solitons within both a continuous model under optical lattices and a tight-binding model. Specifically, we find that a dark soliton is transported by one or half a unit cell, following the center-of-mass position of a Wannier function, as a system parameter is slowly varied over one cycle. Our work opens new avenues for exploring Thouless pumping for defects with phase changes, such as dark solitons, vortex solitons, ring dark solitons, and vortices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Álvaro Diaz-Duque, Vasileios Balos, Alexander P. Fellows, Martin Wolf, Martin Thämer</p>
            <p>The molecular structure of water at charged aqueous interfaces is shaped by interfacial electric fields, which can induce significant anisotropy in the molecular orientations that extends over nanometer-scale distances. Despite great relevance, very little is known about the details of this depth-dependent anisotropic water structure, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental techniques. Here, we present a time-domain spectrometer specifically developed to acquire depth-resolved nonlinear vibrational spectra at aqueous interfaces. The approach is based on combining phase-resolved vibrational sum- and difference-frequency spectra and enables the extraction of depth information on the nanometer scale. The analysis of the acquired resonant spectral line shapes meanwhile yields insight into local hydrogen-bond structures and anisotropic molecular orientations across the interfacial region. In measurements with insoluble charged surfactants, we demonstrate that the obtained data allows for a full reconstruction of the nonlinear vibrational responses as function of depth. The results show the presence of two pronounced regions within the interfacial anisotropy with largely deviating degrees of preferential molecular orientations. A spectral analysis of the depth-dependent vibrational responses furthermore reveals that the natural local hydrogen-bond structure of bulk water remains intact throughout the interfacial region, including water in the direct proximity of the surface charges. These findings significantly refine our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at the interface to charged surfactants and showcase the large potential of our depth-resolved spectroscopic technique.</p>

            <p>Wigner crystals formed by laser-cooled ions in traps are unconventional condensed-matter systems, characterized by interparticle distances of several micrometers and energy scales on the order of $\mu$eV. Their crystalline structure emerges from the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the external confining potential, which can be readily tuned. Moreover, individual ions can be precisely manipulated with lasers and imaged via resonance fluorescence. These unusual and unique properties make ion crystals a powerful platform for studying phases of matter and their dynamics in the strongly correlated quantum regime. This review examines the theoretical framework and experimental characterization of ion Coulomb crystals from a condensed-matter perspective. We highlight their dynamical and thermodynamic properties in one, two, and three dimensions, along with recent investigations into their out-of-equilibrium behavior. We provide outlooks on future directions for exploring novel condensed matter phenomena with trapped ion crystals, as well as their many scientific and technical applications, which have driven advances in controlling and measuring ion crystals in the lab.</p>

            <p>Mitigating noise-induced decoherence is the central challenge in controlling open quantum systems. While existing robust protocols often require precise noise models, we introduce a universal framework for noise-agnostic quantum control that achieves high-fidelity operations without prior environmental noise characterization. This framework capitalizes on the dynamical modification of the system-environment coupling through control drives, an effect rigorously encoded in the dynamical equation. Since the derived noise sensitivity metric remains independent of the coupling details between the system and the environment, our protocol demonstrates provable robustness against arbitrary Markovian noises. Numerical validation through quantum state transfer and gate operations reveals near-unity fidelity ($>\!99\%$) across diverse noise regimes, achieving orders-of-magnitude error suppression compared to target-only approaches. This framework bridges critical gaps between theoretical control design and experimental constraints, establishing a hardware-agnostic pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum technologies across platforms such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and solid-state qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emir Sezik, Jacob Knight, Henry Alston, Connor Roberts, Thibault Bertrand, Gunnar Pruessner, Luca Cocconi</p>
            <p>Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of particular outcomes out of a set of mutually-exclusive possibilities for stochastic processes and play a central role in first-passage problems. For two-dimensional Markov processes $\{X(t),Y(t)\}_{t\in T}$, a joint analogue of the splitting probabilities can be defined, which captures the likelihood that the variable $X(t)$, having been initialised at $x_0 \in \mathbb{L}$, exits $\mathbb{L}$ for the first time via either of the interval boundaries \emph{and} that the variable $Y(t)$, initialised at $y_0$, is given by $y_{\rm exit}$ at the time of exit. We compute such joint splitting probabilities for two classes of processes: processes where $X(t)$ is Brownian motion and $Y(t)$ is a decoupled internal state, and unidirectionally coupled processes where $X(t)$ is drift-diffusive and depends on $Y(t)$, while $Y(t)$ evolves independently. For the first class we obtain generic expressions in terms of the eigensystem of the Fokker-Planck operator for the $Y$ dynamics, while for the second we carry out explicit derivations for three paradigmatic cases (run-and-tumble motion, diffusion in an intermittent piecewise-linear potential and diffusion with stochastic resetting). Drawing on Bayes' theorem, we subsequently introduce the related notion of conditional splitting probabilities, defined as the posterior likelihoods of the internal state $Y$ \emph{given} that the observable degree of freedom $X$ has undergone a specific exit event. After computing these conditional splitting probabilities, we propose a simple scheme that leverages them to partially infer the assumedly hidden state $Y(t)$ from point-wise detection events.</p>

Generically, the NESS on an infinite system does not equal the thermodynamic limit of NESSs on finite systems. We give a sufficient condition that they coincide with each other, in terms of both a condition number, which quantifies the normality of a Liouvillian, and some spectral gaps on finite subsystems. To appreciate the importance of the condition number, we provide an example in which the spectral gaps have nonzero lower bounds uniformly for any finite subsystems but a thermodynamic limit and a long-time limit (or a long-time average) do not commute with each other.</p>

            <p>An algorithm is proposed for constructing quasi-random "peaked" quantum circuits, i.e., circuits whose final qubit state exhibits a high probability concentration on a specific computational basis state. These circuits consist of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for deeper ones.</p>

The systems under consideration are described by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories (2d holographic CFTs), the theories described by gravity. Then, we find that the time ordering of Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions affects the behavior of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation, especially their late-time ones. We also establish the relation between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum densities. This relation states that the late-time behaviors of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation strongly depend on the energy distribution. We also examine how the decay of the quasiparticle influences the bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation. Furthermore, we investigate the gravity dual of the systems considered in this paper.</p>

As a prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space.

            <p>Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier. Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer, and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.</p>

            <p>In non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) emerges as a counterintuitive phenomenon: systems exhibiting greater initial symmetry breaking restore symmetry faster than those with less. While theoretical exploration of QME has surged, experimental studies on its multidimensional modulation remain limited. Here, we report the observation and control of QME using a superconducting processor featuring a unique fully connected, tunable-coupling architecture that enables precise modulation from short- to long-range interactions. This platform allows independent manipulation of coupling regimes, on-site potentials, and initial states, elucidating their roles in QME. To quantify symmetry restoration, we employ entanglement asymmetry (EA) -- the relative entropy between a subsystem reduced density matrix and its symmetric projection -- as a sensitive probe of symmetry breaking. In strong short-range coupling regimes, EA crossovers during quenches from tilted Néel states confirm the presence of QME. In contrast, in intermediate coupling regimes, synchronized EA and entanglement entropy dynamics reveal the suppression of QME. Remarkably, QME reemerges with the introduction of on-site linear potentials or quenches from tilted ferromagnetic states, the latter proving robust against on-site disorder. Our study provides the first demonstration of flexible QME modulation on a superconducting platform with multiple controllable parameters, shedding light on quantum many-body non-equilibrium dynamics and opening avenues for quantum information applications.</p>

            <p>We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.</p>

            <p>Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations. Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits, amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with a versatile experimental platform.</p>

            <p>Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems.

            <h2>Quantum Circuit Complexity of Matrix-Product Unitaries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georgios Styliaris, Rahul Trivedi, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irene Goti, Tommaso Petrucciani, Stefano Condio, Filippo Levi, Davide Calonico, Marco Pizzocaro</p>
            <p>Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is essential for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling, we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach, which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice frequency shifts and find deviations up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level or below, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.</p>

            <h2>Fast and efficient long-distance quantum state transfer in long-range spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Faria, C.C. Nelmes, T.J.G. Apollaro, T.P. Spiller, I. D'Amico</p>
            <p>Quantum state transfer is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling scheme in long spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ linear chains. Exploiting the properties of the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that with minimal engineering, i.e., an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average transfer fidelity above $99\%$ can be achieved. To leading order, the required time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to longer range coupling schemes.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Metal-Insulator and Spectral Phase Transitions in Aubry-André-Harper Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quan Lin, Christopher Cedzich, Qi Zhou, Peng Xue</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian extensions of the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model reveal a rich variety of phase transitions arising from the interplay of quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity. Despite their theoretical significance, experimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing controlled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization of the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by employing single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of quasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a phase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian limit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally probe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized by the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel spectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all quasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to changes in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological origins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry breaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for future exploration of synthetic quantum matter.</p>

            <p>How frictional effects emerge at the microscopic level in particulate materials remains a challenging question, particularly in systems subject to thermal fluctuations due to the transient nature of interparticle contacts. Here, we directly relate particle-level frictional arrest to local coordination in an attractive colloidal model system. We reveal that the orientational dynamics of particles slows down exponentially with increasing coordination number due to the emergence of frictional interactions, the strength of which can be tuned simply by varying the attraction strength. Using a simple computer simulation model, we uncover how the interparticle interactions govern the formation of frictional contacts between particles. Our results establish quantitative relations between friction, coordination and interparticle interactions. This is a key step towards using interparticle friction to tune the mechanical properties of particulate materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Xin Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>Increasing numerical studies showed that the simplest Hubbard model on the square lattice with strong repulsion may not exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC). It is desired to look for other possible microscopic mechanism of realizing high-temperature SC. Here, we explore the interplay between the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and the Hubbard repulsion by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations. Our state-of-the-art DMRG study showed convincingly that the interplay between strong Hubbard $U$ and moderate Su-Schrieffer-Heeger EPC $\lambda$ can induce robust $d$-wave SC. The SSH-type EPC can generate effective antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions between neighboring sites, which plays a crucial role in the interplay of inducing robust $d$-wave SC. Specifically, for $U=8t$, we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda>\lambda_c$ with a moderate critical value $\lambda_c=0.1\sim 0.2$. Our results might shed new light to understanding high-temperature SC in cuprates as well as pave a possible new route in looking for high-temperature SC in other quantum materials with both strong $U$ and moderate $\lambda$.</p>

            <p>The advancement of spin-based devices as a replacement for CMOS technology demands lower spin-switching energy in ferromagnetic (FM) materials. Ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a promising avenue for influencing FM properties, yet the mechanisms driving this interplay remain inadequately understood.

Our findings reveal a universal correlation between the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of iron and the induced magnetic dipole moments within the BO$_2$ layer and basal oxygen atoms of ABO$_3$ at the FE/FM interface. By identifying key material descriptors and achieving high predictive accuracy, this research provides a robust framework for selecting and optimizing ABO$_3$ substrates for energy-efficient spintronic devices.

            <p>Ta3Sb is one of the A15 compounds that have been predicted to have giant spin Hall conductivities due to the gapped Dirac-like band crossings in their electronic structures. We use co-sputtering to directly synthesize thin films of Ta3Sb and identify a large window of Ta:Sb flux ratio that permits the formation of single-phase A15 structure. These sputtered films have an actual Ta:Sb atomic ratio of 4:1 as determined from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Their high resistivity, at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, suggests that the electron mean free path is comparable to interatomic distances. From harmonic Hall and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity of thin film Ta3Sb is estimated to be in the range of -526 to -1230 (hbar/e) S/cm at 300 K, lower in magnitude than the predicted value of -1400 (hbar/e) S/cm. First-principles calculations of the electronic structure show that the discrepancy is consistent with an increase of the Fermi level due to the non-ideal stoichiometry needed to stabilize the A15 structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Penghao Zhu, A. Alexandradinata</p>
            <p>Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>A nonlocal string order parameter detecting topological order and deconfinement has been proposed by Fredenhagen and Marcu (FM). However, due to the lack of exact internal symmetries for lattice models and the nonlinear dependence of the FM string order parameter on ground states, it is a priori not guaranteed that it is a genuine order parameter for topological phase transitions. In this work, we find that the FM string order parameter exhibits universal scaling behavior near critical points of charge condensation transitions, by directly evaluating the FM string order parameter in the infinite string-length limit using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) for the toric code in a magnetic field. Our results thus demonstrate that the FM string order parameter represents a quantitatively well-behaved order parameter. We find that only in the presence of an emergent 1-form symmetry the corresponding FM string order parameter can faithfully detect topological transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> MingRui Lai, Fengyuan Xuan, Su Ying Quek</p>
            <p>The concept of quantum geometry for single-particle states has revolutionized our interpretation of several emergent properties in condensed matter. However, a description of the quantum geometry for interacting particles and an understanding of its implications are lacking. Here, we show that inherent in the non-linear optical response is a quantum geometry of the correlated electron-hole state (exciton) that arises from the interplay between geometry and interactions - distinct from the quantum geometric properties of the individual electron or hole states. We demonstrate using first principles calculations that this quantum many-body geometry significantly enhances the non-linear optical response in systems with strong excitonic effects. In the case of shift currents, the quantum many-body geometric term arises in the many-body shift vector and can be interpreted as a many-body analogue of the Berry phase. This work lays the foundation to study the quantum geometry of correlated states in experimentally observable settings.</p>

If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</p>

            <p>At the quantum critical point of correlated materials, a non-Fermi liquid state appears where electron correlations continuously develop to very low temperatures. The relaxation time of the interacted electrons, namely quasiparticles, is scaled with the Planckian time, $\hbar/k_{\rm B}T$. However, there is a debate over whether heavy-fermion systems can obey the Planckian time. In the optical conductivity spectra, the Drude response will appear as the scaling of $\hbar\omega/k_{\rm B}T$ as the dynamical Planckian scaling (DPS). Here, we report the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the Drude response of a candidate for such materials, the quasi-kagome Kondo lattice CeRhSn. Even though the material shows a strong valence fluctuation, renormalized Drude responses observed at the photon energy below 100 meV are characterized by non-Fermi-liquid-like scattering rate $1/\tau$. The heavy carriers' Drude response only for the Ce quasi-kagome plane obeyed DPS below 80 K, suggesting the anisotropic quantum criticality with the strong $c \textrm{-} f$ hybridization.</p>

            <p>Quasiparticle excitations in material solids often experience a fictitious gauge field, which can be a potential source of intriguing transport phenomena. Here, we show that low-energy excitations in insulating antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals on the triangular lattice are effectively described by magnons with an SU(3) gauge field. The three-sublattice structure in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals is inherited as three internal degrees of freedom for the magnons, which are coupled to their kinetic motion via the SU(3) gauge field that arises from the topologically nontrivial spin texture in real space. We show that the non-commutativity of the SU(3) gauge field breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and contributes to a magnon thermal Hall effect. We further demonstrate the emergence of the finite thermal Hall conductivity in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals by the linear spin-wave theory. The possible impact of different gauge structures on a thermal Hall conductivity is also discussed.</p>

            <p>The study of kagome materials has attracted much attention in the past few years due to the presence of many electron-electron interaction-driven phases in a single material. These include charge density waves, nematic phases, superconducting phases, and pair density waves. In this work, we report the discovery of intrinsic spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the thin-flake kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Firstly, when an in-plane magnetic field is swept in opposite directions, we observe a unique form of hysteresis in magnetoresistance which is different from the hysteresis induced by extrinsic mechanisms such as flux-trapping or superheating and supercooling effects. The unconventional hysteresis indicates the emergence of an intrinsic time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phase. Strikingly, at a fixed magnetic field, the finite-resistance state can be transitioned into the superconducting state by applying and subsequently removing a large current. Secondly, at temperatures around 400 mK, the re-entrance of superconductivity occurs during an in-plane field-sweeping process. This kind of re-entrance is asymmetric about the zero field axis and observed in all field directions for a fixed current direction, which is different from the re-entrance observed in conventional superconductors. These findings put very strong constraints on the possible superconducting pairing symmetry of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. We point out that the pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry and all the observed novel properties, is possibly a time-reversal symmetry-breaking, p-wave pairing with net spin polarization. Importantly, this p-wave pairing gives rise to a nodal topological superconducting state with Majorana flat bands on the sample edges.</p>

            <h2>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and generalized Fermi surface formula in arbitrary dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Zhang, Chang Shu, Kai Sun</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially localized edge modes in open-boundary systems, has led to the discovery of numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to this familiar exponential localization, we report a distinct phenomenon--the algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect--which arises generically in non-Hermitian systems with two or more spatial dimensions. In such cases, the amplitude of skin modes typically decays from the boundary following a power law, rather than an exponential form--a behavior not captured by existing theoretical frameworks. To bridge this gap and describe the transition in localization from one to higher dimensions, we develop a generalized Fermi surface framework applicable to open-boundary systems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework not only reproduces known results for the exponential skin effect in 1D, but also predicts a new class of skin effects with algebraic decay in 2D and above. We demonstrate this framework in both tight-binding and continuum models in two and three dimensions. This investigation not only unveils a novel category of the non-Hermitian skin effect but also offers a comprehensive theoretical structure that describes skin effects in any non-Hermitian system, irrespective of its spatial dimensionality.</p>

            <p>In contrast to conventional Weyl semimetals in achiral crystals, chiral topological semimetals in chiral crystals exhibit Weyl nodes at time-reversal-invariant momenta. A Fermi surface spin texture with parallel spin-momentum locking in these material has been observed by a recent experiment [Nat. Comm. 15,3720(2024)]. We find that the Weyl nodes location and the Fermi surface spin texture lead to gapped zero-momenta intranode superconductivity (SC), which is absent in achiral Weyl semimetals. Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we find that a cubic lattice system in general favors a mixture of spin-singlet $s_\pm$ and $d+id$-wave pairings. In the presence of only the $s_\pm$-wave pairing, we identify a first-order time-reversal invariant topological SC phase. Notably, an SC phase with two Majorana cones for opened Fermi surfaces is energetically favorable. In addition, a second-order topological superconductor with chiral Majorana states can be realized in the presence of a mixture of $s\pm$- and $d+id$-wave pairing. We show that chiral topological semimetals in cubic lattice are fascinating platforms for exploring intrinsic unconventional superconductivity and topological superconductivity.</p>

            <p>High gain and large bandwidth of traveling-wave parametric amplifier exploiting the nonlinearity of Josephson Junctions can be achieved by fulfilling the so-called phase-matching condition. This condition is usually addressed by placing resonant structures along the waveguide or by periodic modulations of its parameters, creating gaps in the waveguide's dispersion. Here, we propose to employ the Josephson junctions, which constitute the centerline of the amplifier, as resonant elements for phase matching. By numerical simulations in JoSIM (and WRspice) software, we show that Josephson plasma oscillations can be utilized to create wavevector mismatch sufficient for phase matching as well as to prevent the conversion of the pump energy to higher harmonics. The proposed TWPA design has a gain of 15 dB and a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TWPAs.</p>

The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.</p>

            <p>We introduce "stochastic cloaking," where a region of space is concealed from an ensemble of diffusing particles whose individual trajectories are governed by a stochastic (Langevin) equation. Our simulations reveal how different interpretations of the Langevin equation affect the cloaking performance of an annular single-layer invisibility cloak of smoothly varying diffusivity in two dimensions. Near-perfect cloaking is achieved under the Ito convention, indicated by the cloak preventing particles from accessing an inner core without disturbing the particle density outside the cloak. The cloak's performance can be further improved by regularising its singular behaviour. We believe our demonstration of stochastic cloaking is a significant milestone, comparable to earlier developments that extended cloaking from optics and acoustics to thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the influence of indium doping on the defect states in (Bi0.3Sb0.7)2Te3 (BST) ternary topological insulators. Thin (10 nm) and thick (60 nm) films of pristine BST and indium-doped BST (In0.14(Bi0.3Sb0.7)1.86Te3) were synthesized using pulsed laser deposition. The electronic properties were characterized through low-frequency noise spectroscopy and temperature-dependent resistance (R-T) measurements. For the 10 nm films, R-T analysis revealed that indium doping shifts the thermal activation energy by approximately 100 meV. This doping also suppresses a shallow impurity band at 72 meV, a finding corroborated by 1/f noise measurements. In the 60 nm films, noise spectroscopy was used to probe deep defect states, where indium doping was found to increase the activation energy from 292.3 meV to 392 meV -- a consistent shift of 100 meV. These findings demonstrate that indium doping is an effective method for systematically modifying both shallow and deep defect states, enhancing the insulating properties and offering a mechanism to engineer the electronic behavior of topological insulators for advanced electronic applications where noise reduction is crucial.</p>

Unlike standard sum-rules that extend out to $infinite$ frequencies, which include contributions from $all$ inter-band transitions, we focus here on transitions associated $only$ with the $projected$ degrees of freedom. We analyze the partial sum-rule in a non-perturbative but "solvable" limit for a variety of correlation-induced insulators. This includes (i) magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene at integer-filling with projected Coulomb interactions, starting from the chiral flat-band limit and including realistic perturbations, (ii) fractional fillings of Chern-bands which support generalized Laughlin-like states, starting from a Landau-level and including a periodic potential and magnetic-field, respectively, drawing connections to twisted MoTe$_2$, and (iii) integer filling in toy-models of non-topological flat-bands with a tunable quantum geometry in the presence of repulsive interactions. The partial sum-rule in all of these examples is implicitly constrained by the form of the band quantum geometry via the low-lying excitation spectrum, but is not related to it explicitly. For interacting Slater-determinant insulators, the partial sum-rule is related to a new quantity -- "many-body projected quantum geometry" -- obtained from the interaction-renormalized electronic bands. We also point out an intriguing connection between the partial sum-rule and the quantum Fisher information associated with the projected many-body position operator.</p>

            <h2>Unified percolation scenario for the $α$ and $β$ processes in simple glass formers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Gao, Hai-Bin Yu, Thomas B. Schrøder, Jeppe C. Dyre</p>
            <p>Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here, we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called alpha and beta relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the alpha process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a beta process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (alpha) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no beta relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective.</p>

            <h2>Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arijit Mandal, S. Satpathy, B.R.K. Nanda</p>
            <p>The topological Hall effect is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work opens up the scope to go beyond the existing avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Temperature Induced Transition and Convergence of Thermal Conductivity in Germanene Monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sapta Sindhu Paul Chowdhury, Sourav Thapliyal, Santosh Mogurampelly</p>
            <p>We report an anomalous temperature-induced transition in thermal conductivity in germanene monolayer around a critical temperature $T_c = 350 \, \text{K}$. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal a transition from $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ scaling below $T_c$ to $\kappa \sim T^{-1/2}$ above, contrasting with conventional $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ behavior. This anomalous scaling correlates with the long-scale characteristic timescale $\tau_2$ obtained from double exponential fitting of the heat current autocorrelation function. Phonon mode analysis using normal mode decomposition indicates that a redshift in ZO phonons reduces the acoustic-optical phonon gap, causing an overlap, enhances the phonon-phonon scattering, driving the anomalous scaling behavior. Moreover, nonequilibrium simulations find a convergent thermal conductivity of germanene with sample size, in agreement with mode coupling theory, owing to the high scattering of ZA phonons due to the inherent buckling of germanene.</p>

            <p>Oxyhydrides represent a new class of functional materials, yet the synthesis of dense polycrystals or single-crystals suitable for transport studies remains a significant challenge due to hydrogen desorption at elevated temperatures. The co-diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen in densely sintered BaTiO3 enables the topochemical formation of millimeter-scale bulk BaTiO3-xHx via high-pressure diffusion control (HPDC). Hydride ions selectively occupy oxygen-deficient sites, as confirmed by neutron diffraction, TPD, TG, and NMR. Systematic tuning of the hydrogen content and precise control of the electronic conductivity were achieved via HPDC. Hydrogen desorption analysis reveals distinct bonding states between near-surface and interior-bulk regions, which significantly affect the oxynitride conversion under N2 flow. Importantly, the diffusion-based nature of HPDC allows direct anion conversion even in single-crystalline oxides, as demonstrated by the synthesis of SrTiO3-xHx single crystals. These results establish HPDC as a general platform for accessing dense, metastable oxyhydrides with tunable anionic composition and transport properties.</p>

            <h2>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</h2>

            <p>A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net charge carriers emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the transport variables in hydrodynamic domain. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature and Lorenz number $L_{0}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}$. The validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law can be checked by evaluating the Lorenz ratio, which is expected to be unity. We investigate the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law by examining whether the Lorenz ratio equals unity or deviates from it. Our findings indicate that, within the fluid-based framework, the Lorenz ratio consistently leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This is attributed to the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per net charge carriers in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene and quark-gluon plasma, both systems at a low net carrier density, violate the Wiedemann-Franz law due to their fluidic nature. However, graphene at a relatively high net carrier density obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or electron density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high carrier density. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of quark-gluon plasma at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic Matter and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun Wang Chau, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager</p>
            <p>We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a nontrivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a nontrivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topological jump originating from the Euler class in the presence of $d$-wave superconducting pairings, and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the noninteracting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced nonlinear currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He</p>
            <p>Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.</p>

            <h2>Multiphysics simulations of microstructure influence on hysteresis and eddy current losses of electrical steel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Kühn, Yangyiwei Yang, Guanyu Chen, Shanelle N. Foster, Herbert Egger, Bai-Xiang Xu</p>
            <p>Improving efficiency of electrical machines requires fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms behind magnetic and eddy current losses of the magnetic core materials, with Fe-Si alloy as a prototype. These losses are intrinsically influenced by the microstructure of the materials. This necessitates physics-based, microstructure-informed multiscale simulations. In the present paper, we utilised micromagnetic simulations and computational homogenization methods to calculate the effective hysteresis and effective conductivities of Fe-Si electrical steels. To demonstrate the methodology, binder-jet printed electrical steel material samples with different microstructure were investigated. The microstructure samples were digitized based on both the descriptor-based synthetic reconstruction and SEM-image-based digitization. More samples were generated with varying microstructure features such as grain size and grain boundary phases. The micromagnetic simulations were then performed to investigate the magnetic hysteresis and hysteresis loss. The eddy current loss was also evaluated by using the effective conductivity through computational homogenization. By performing parameter research on a series of synthetic microstructures, effects of average grain size and grain boundary (GB) phase thickness on the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss were unveiled. An average grain size around 120 \si{\micro m} has the lowest hysteresis loss, although the eddy current loss increases with the grain size. Increasing GB-phase thickness helps reduce both losses. Results indicate the potential to decrease loss of magnetic core materials by microstructure optimization.</p>

            <p>Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.</p>

We not only show that low-energy excitons possessing large binding energies up to 3 eV are present in the visible range in all the considered wide-gap insulators, but also that the nature and properties of these excitons differs from those in double perovskite halides as well as perovskite oxides. We provide insights on the origin of such differences by a comparative analysis of the electronic structure. Our findings elucidate possible correlations between the exciton properties and the composition, via the electronic structure, towards a comprehensive understanding of correlation effects and rational design principles.</p>

            <p>Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD, which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the magnetism of pyrochlore oxides, we consider the effect of quantum fluctuations in the most general symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor Kramers exchange Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. At the classical level, this Hamiltonian exhibits a rich landscape of classical spin liquids and a variety of nonconventional magnetic phases. In contrast, much remains unclear for the quantum model, where quantum fluctuations have the potential to alter the classical landscape and stabilize novel magnetic phases. Employing state-of-the-art pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group calculations for the spin-$1/2$ model, we determine the quantum phase diagram at relevant cross-sections, where the classical model hosts an algebraic nodal rank-2 spin liquid and a spin nematic order. We find large regions in parameter space on which dipolar magnetic order is absent and, based on known fingerprints in the correlation functions, we suggest that this nonconventional region is composed of an ensemble of distinct phases stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Our results hint at the existence of a spin nematic phase, and we identify the quantum analog of the classical rank-2 spin liquid. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of assessing the subtle interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in reconciling the experimental findings on the nature of magnetic order in Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with >98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn and monoclinic ZrO$_2$). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.</p>

We show how the pressure anisotropy can be used to clearly define the bulk and interface regions and extract a genuine shear-rate dependent surface tension.

            <h2>Formulation of spin Nernst effect for spin-nonconserving insulating magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinnosuke Koyama, Joji Nasu</p>
            <p>The spin Nernst effect, an antisymmetric response of a spin current to a temperature gradient, has attracted attention as spin transport phenomenon arising from the topologically nontrivial band structure of carriers. This effect can occur not only in itinerant electron systems but also in localized electron systems that emerge due to electronic correlations. In such systems, elementary excitations behaving as bosons govern spin transport, and magnetic interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling can induce a topologically nontrivial band structure. However, such magnetic interactions can potentially break spin conservation, thereby preventing conventional spin currents from being conserved. In this study, starting from a general localized electron model, we formulate the spin Nernst effect in terms of a conserved spin current that remains applicable even in spin-nonconserving systems. To address the torque term appearing in the conserved spin current, we adopt semiclassical theory and derive an expression for the spin Nernst coefficient for bosonic systems. This coefficient consists of two terms originating from the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which are distinctly different from the spin Berry curvature obtained in an approach that neglects the torque term. We apply our framework to two specific quantum spin models, the Kitaev-Heisenberg and Shastry-Sutherland models, and calculate the temperature dependence of the spin Nernst coefficient. We find that this quantity significantly differs from that obtained by neglecting the torque term in both models. Furthermore, we clarify that the impact of the torque term on the spin Nernst effect strongly depends on the model parameters, suggesting that our formulation based on the conserved spin current is essential for understanding this effect in insulating magnets.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a Néel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear Néel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42° and 26° respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered Néel order of local dipole moments.</p>

            <p>Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</p>

            <p>Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content, widely employed in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments.</p>

A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</p>

            <h2>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Quade, Michael Potthoff</p>
            <p>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by $2\pi$ rotations of the phase $\phi$ of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces ${\cal H}_{0}(\phi)$ based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective $\sigma_{x}$-gate and a projective $\sigma_{z}$-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.</p>

            <h2>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D: ground state and real-time dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yantao Wu, Wen-Yuan Liu</p>
            <p>We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D for both ground state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo (VMC), enabling efficient computations for (2+1)D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground state simulation of pure $Z_2$, $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ gauge theory, odd-$Z_2$ gauge theories, and $Z_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long-time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined $Z_2$ gauge field on a $10\times10$ lattice. This is also the first example of using VMC to simulate the real-time dynamics of PEPS, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.</p>

            <p>Atomic-resolution imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the nanoscale structure of materials, in particular features such as defects, local strains, and symmetry-breaking distortions. In addition to advanced instrumentation, the effectiveness of the technique depends on computational image analysis to extract meaningful features from complex datasets recorded in experiments, which can be complicated by the presence of noise and artifacts, small or overlapping features, and the need to scale analysis over large representative areas. Here, we present image analysis approaches which synergize real and reciprocal space information to efficiently and reliably obtain meaningful structural information with picometer scale precision across hundreds of nanometers of material from atomic-resolution electron microscope images. Damping superstructure peaks in reciprocal space allows symmetry-breaking structural distortions to be disentangled from other sources of inhomogeneity and measured with high precision. Real space fitting of the wave-like signals resulting from Fourier filtering enables absolute quantification of lattice parameter variations and strain, as well as the uncertainty associated with these measurements. Implementations of these algorithms are made available as an open source Python package.</p>

The associated Wigner entropy, derived from this distribution, peaks at the critical state, enabling precise localization of the mobility edge.

            <p>Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1{\mu}m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.</p>

            <h2>Persistent Homology-Based Indicator of Orientational Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems applied to Skyrmion Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michiki Taniwaki, Thomas Brian Winkler, Jan Rothörl, Raphael Gruber, Chiharu Mitsumata, Masato Kotsugi, Mathias Kläui</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particle systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, exhibit topological phase transitions between unique 2D phases. However, to identify the phases, an easy and computationally low-cost methodology for capturing the configurational properties of lattice ordering and constructing such an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is, though, not obvious. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude of the orientational order parameter $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$), typically used to identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator to experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of simulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the proposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of interacting quasi-particles. As a key advantage, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures.</p>

            <p>The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation is be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.</p>

            <h2>Braided mixing in confined chiral active matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Wang, Jonas Berx</p>
            <p>Efficient mixing of fluids is essential in many practical applications to achieve homogeneity. For microscopic systems, however, both diffusion and turbulence are ineffective methods to achieve chaotic mixing due to the low Reynolds number, hence either active stirring or inducing turbulence through geometric boundary effects are generally implemented. Here, we study a modified chiral Vicsek model, where active microswimmers act as moving rods, stirring the surrounding substrate. We study the degree of mixing in the patterns formed by interplay between confinement, chiral motion and alignment interactions. This mixing is computed by considering the entanglement of spacetime trajectories of the particles, which forms a braid. Optimising the finite-time braiding exponent of this braid then yields a set of constituent parameters of the system, showing that a pattern consisting of a local stable vortex droplet and an ordered oscillating phase achieves the highest degree of mixing.</p>

            <p>Fundamentally understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport behavior in liquid-like, partially occupied compounds remains a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying the ultralow thermal conductivity in ordered/liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ by combining experimental methods with first-principles calculations. We first experimentally synthesize and characterize the ordered structure and liquid-like, partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with increasing temperature. We then combine self-consistent phonon calculations, including bubble-diagram corrections, with the Wigner transport equation, considering both phonon propagation and diffuson contributions, to evaluate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity in phase-change Cu$_3$BiS$_3$. Our theoretical model predicts an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.34 W/m/K at 400 K, dominated by diffuson contributions, which accurately reproduces and explains the experimental data. Importantly, the machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations not only reproduced the partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with the space group $\mathrm{P2_12_12_1}$ but also successfully replicated the thermal conductivity obtained from experiments and Wigner transport calculations. This observation highlights the negligible impact of ionic mobility arising from partially occupied Cu sites on the thermal conductivity in diffuson-dominated thermal transport compounds. Our work not only sheds light on the minimal impact of ionic mobility on ultralow thermal conductivity in phase-change materials but also demonstrates that the Wigner transport equation accurately describes thermal transport behavior in partially occupied phases with diffuson-dominant thermal transport.</p>

            <p>Noncollinear antiferromagnets offer much promise for antiferromagnetic spintronics and neuromorphic applications with a plethora of functional properties surpassing many competing magnetic systems. Films grown on mismatched substrates may relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects that strongly manipulate global physical properties important for application. This work demonstrates that a post growth annealing strategy results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that reveal the underlying thermal evolution of the magnetic order symmetry. Beyond a critical film thickness, the spin structure transitions between two right-handed irreducible chiral representations via left-handed chiral ordering producing a striking change in the sign and angular dependence of the Anomalous Hall coefficient. The previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane cannot fully explain the transition in applied magnetic field, and using a macrospin model this work finds that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction are energetically preferable under certain conditions. These observations suggest that both left-handed and right-handed chiral order can be accessed in a single system, opening new routes to engineer devices by controlled switching of magnetic chirality allowing selection of associated functional properties as governed by symmetry.</p>

            <p>2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as promising materials for spintronic applications due to their unique magnetic properties and tunability. Controlling ferromagnetism via external stimuli is critical for both fundamental research and device integration. In particular, modulation of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions through strain offers a viable pathway for functional control. Owing to their weak interlayer coupling, vdW ferromagnets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to strain, enabling effective tuning of their magnetic states. In this study, electric-field-induced magnetoelectric coupling is investigated in the above-room-temperature vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ integrated on a ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. It is demonstrated that application of an electric field leads to a substantial reduction in coercive force along with dynamic reconfiguration of the magnetic domain structure. These effects are attributed to electric-field-induced modulation of the vdW interlayer gap and enhancement of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings reveal a strong interplay between electric fields and magnetism in vdW systems, offering a viable route toward the development of low-power, multifunctional magnetic devices. This work establishes a foundation for the electric-field control of magnetic properties in vdW ferromagnets and highlights their potential in next-generation spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate strain-induced contributions to the transient polar magneto-optical Kerr effect response in laser-excited terfenol. The tr-MOKE signals obtained from TbFe$_{2}$ films with and without glass capping exhibit distinct signatures associated with transient strain. We experimentally observe the arrival of strain pulses via the reflectivity change. The tr-MOKE response measured without changing the pump-probe geometry is delayed by several picoseconds. This suggests a genuine magnetization response as opposed to instantaneous changes of optical constants as the origin of the signal. We model the propagation of longitudinal acoustic picosecond strain pulses and incorporate the inverse magnetostriction effect via a magnetoelastic term in the effective field of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with large damping. This reproduces not only the delay of the pulsed response, but also unveils the dominant contribution of quasi-static strain to the magnetization dynamics due to the thermal expansion in the optically probed near-surface region. Our experiments exemplify that purely longitudinal strain along the out-of-plane direction of the thin film enables efficient magnetoelastic coupling via the shear strain components arising in the oblique crystallographic frame of reference.</p>

In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.</p>

            <p>We investigate the thermoelectric performance of 2D nanojunctions with gate tunable architectures and varying channel lengths from 3 to 12 nm using a combination of first principles simulations, including density functional theory, DFT with nonequilibrium Greens function formalism (nanoDCAL), and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a gate, temperature, and length dependent transition from quantum to classical in electron transport, transitioning from quantum tunneling in short junctions to thermionic emission in longer ones. We observe nontrivial dependencies of the thermoelectric figure of merit on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivities, and thermal conductivities as a result of this crossover and gate controlling. We identify that maximizing ZT requires tuning the chemical potential just outside the band gap, where the system lies at the transition between insulating and conducting regimes. While extremely large Seebeck coefficients are observed in the insulating state, they do not yield high ZT due to suppressed electrical conductivity and dominant phononic thermal transport. The optimal ZT larger than 2.3 is achieved in the shortest 3 nm junction at 500 K, where quantum tunneling and thermionic emission coexist. These findings offer fundamental insights into transport mechanisms in 2D semiconducting nanojunctions and present design principles for high efficiency nanoscale thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <p>Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.</p>

In this work, we introduce aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions, temperatures, and their corresponding phase information.

We fine-tuned Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats: multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials systems.

            <p>Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 100%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.</p>

            <p>Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheng-Tai Lee, Tom C. Lubensky, Tomer Markovich</p>
            <p>Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</p>

            <h2>Localization structure of electronic states in the quantum Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alioune Seye, Marcel Filoche</p>
            <p>We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schrödinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Lieb Materials: Altermagnetism and More</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Hao Chang, Igor I. Mazin, Kirill D. Belashchenko</p>
            <p>The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large Néel temperature ($\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihao Hu, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses [\href{this https URL}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a "self-Moiré" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivianne Olguín-Arias, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Roberto E. Troncoso</p>
            <p>We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs). Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and exploring collective spin transport phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Unexpectedly large entropic barrier controls bond rearrangements in vitrimers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shinian Cheng, Lilliana Rey, Beibei Yao, Ivan Popov, Alexei P. Sokolov</p>
            <p>Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.</p>

            <h2>Analytical shortcuts to adiabaticity of weakly driven processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Nazé</p>
            <p>The analytical expression for shortcuts to adiabaticity for any switching time and any thermally isolated system performing a finite-time and weakly driven process is presented. It is based on the analytical solution of the optimal protocols of weak processes for open systems. The extension to adiabatic processes was made by employing the concept of waiting time. The shortcuts to adiabaticity are proven by showing that the excess power is null in all instants, indicating that no nonequilibrium excitation occurs along the driving. Two examples are solved to verify the validity of such shortcuts: the typical case of oscillatory relaxation function and the transverse-field quantum Ising chain. In this last case, it is shown that non-quenching process outperforms the quenching one by suppressing the non-equilibrium excitations until the critical point is not achieved.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehuan Tang, Tingfeng Ma, Boyue Su, Qing Xia, Pengfei Kang, Bowei Wu</p>
            <p>When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observed anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated due to the implied symmetries between the two steady states. On the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition modes under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effect is no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</p>

            <p>Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</p>

            <p>Quantum neural networks, parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function, provide a paradigm for achieving near-term quantum advantage in quantum information processing. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance, however, the role of quantum data in training for supervised learning such as classification and regression remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition where the target values and data determine the convergence of the training. Through analytical classification over the fixed points of the dynamical equation, we reveal a comprehensive `phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics originating from a bifurcation with multiple codimension. Perturbative analyses identify both exponential and polynomial convergence class. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations and experimentation on IBM quantum devices. Our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to accelerate convergence in QNN training.</p>

            <h2>Experimental protocol for observing single quantum many-body scars with transmon qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Græns Larsen, Anne E. B. Nielsen, André Eckardt, Francesco Petiziol</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars are energy eigenstates which fail to reproduce thermal expectation values of local observables, in systems where the rest of the many-body spectrum fulfils eigenstate thermalization. Experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has so far been limited to models with multiple scar states evenly spaced in energy. It is thus an interesting question whether even single isolated scars, which theoretically embody the weakest possibile violation of eigenstate thermalization and may be thought to have no detectable impact in experiments, can leave a trace in measurable quantities. Moreover, single scars offer an interesting scenario for exploring the connection between quantum many-body scars and the original notion of scarring in quantum dynamical systems theory. Here we propose protocols to observe single scars in architectures of fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling superconducting qubits. We first adapt known models possessing the desired features into a form particularly suited for the experimental platform. We develop protocols for the implementation of these models, through trotterized sequences of two-qubit cross-resonance interactions, and verify the existence of the approximate scar state in the stroboscopic effective Hamiltonian. Since a single scar cannot be detected from coherent revivals in the dynamics, differently from towers of scar states, we propose and numerically investigate alternative and experimentally-accessible signatures. These include the dynamical response of the scar to local state deformations, to controlled noise, and to the resolution of the Lie-Suzuki-Trotter digitization.</p>

We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We show that simulations of these more realistic models of high-temperature superconductors require only an order of magnitude or so more Toffoli gates than a simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli and qubit counts that far lower than commonly considered quantum phase estimation circuits for electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</p>

            <p>The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</p>

            <p>Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. However, existing tweezer platforms have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two dimensional arrays with more than 1000 trapped atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Leveraging sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, our platform allows scaling far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances will facilitate tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</p>

            <p>The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</p>

Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.</p>

We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions.

            <p>Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration.

This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential.

            <p>Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-form symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.</p>

            <h2>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin</p>
            <p>Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.</p>

            <h2>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover</p>
            <p>The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</p>

            <h2>Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. Liu, F. Liu, D. Zenkert, M. Åkermo, M. Fagerström</p>
            <p>Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behaviour confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after buckling, followed by membrane yielding. Based on the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling strength and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructures of low-density closed-cell foams.</p>

            <h2>A Set of Tutorials for the LAMMPS Simulation Package</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Gravelle, Cecilia M. S. Alvares, Jacob R. Gissinger, Axel Kohlmeyer</p>
            <p>The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Fahimi, Andrew J. Irwin, Michael Lynch</p>
            <p>The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</p>

            <h2>Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Andras Di Giovanni, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov, Martin Gärttner</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data postprocessing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error-mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures, using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evgeny S. Asmolov, Elena F. Silkina, Olga I. Vinogradova</p>
            <p>The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guo-Hua Liang, Ai-Guo Mei, Zhi-Hui Yang, Ze-Lin Wei</p>
            <p>This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential, while the geodesic and Gaussian curvatures govern the effective scalar potential in the Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudo-magnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.</p>

            <h2>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emad Chaparian</p>
            <p>A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.</p>

            <h2>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization for Complex Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenric P. Nelson</p>
            <p>The coupled entropy is proven to correct a flaw in the derivation of the Tsallis entropy and thereby solidify the theoretical foundations for analyzing the uncertainty of complex systems. The Tsallis entropy originated from considering power probabilities $p_i^q$ in which \textit{q} independent, identically-distributed random variables share the same state. The maximum entropy distribution was derived to be a \textit{q}-exponential, which is a member of the shape ($\kappa$), scale ($\sigma$) distributions. Unfortunately, the $q$-exponential parameters were treated as though valid substitutes for the shape and scale. This flaw causes a misinterpretation of the generalized temperature and an imprecise derivation of the generalized entropy. The coupled entropy is derived from the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) and the Student's t distribution, whose shape derives from nonlinear sources and scale derives from linear sources of uncertainty. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$, which makes it too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy provides perfect balance, ranging from $\ln \sigma$ for $\kappa=0$ to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. Examples of complex systems design including a coupled variation inference algorithm are reviewed.</p>

            <h2>Windowing in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy: resolving resonances in thin-film samples</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esteban Marulanda, Fernanda L. Costa, Nicolas M. Kawahala, Felix G. G. Hernandez</p>
            <p>Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing remains one of the most widely adopted strategies to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Although other analysis techniques exist, including parametric spectral estimation, this study focuses on formalizing windowing-based processing into an accessible experimental workflow. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abbas K. Rizi</p>
            <p>The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</p>

            <p>Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ippo Orii</p>
            <p>We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) * Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state. Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute value. This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Xi Foo, Aisha Kermiche, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Clarice D. Aiello, Luke D. Smith</p>
            <p>The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.</p>

Through a combination of quantum experiments, numerical calculations, and analytical methods, we demonstrate a rich set of phenomena accessible on such quantum simulators by studying an array of Rydberg atoms placed on the Lieb lattice. First, we map out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.</p>

            <p>Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is a compelling material for integrated photonics due to its strong electro-optic and second-order nonlinear properties. Crystal Ion Slicing (CIS) presents a scalable and CMOS-compatible route for fabricating thin BaTiO$_3$ films; however, ion implantation during CIS introduces lattice damage that can degrade structural and optical performance. In this study, we demonstrate that post-slicing thermal annealing effectively restores the structural integrity and optical quality of CIS-processed BaTiO$_3$ flakes. Raman spectroscopy confirms the recovery of crystallinity, while second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy reveals systematic reorientation of ferroelectric domains and restoration of the associated second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor $X^{(2)}$. Notably, SHG signals persist even in regions with weak Raman signatures, indicating that long-range ferroelectric order can survive despite partial lattice disruption. Optical measurements show that the linear dispersion of annealed CIS flakes closely matches that of bulk BaTiO$_3$, validating their suitability for photonic integration. Together, these results qualify CIS - combined with thermal annealing - as a viable and scalable manufacturing strategy for high-quality BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator (BTOI) platforms, enabling advanced integrated photonic devices for modulation, frequency conversion, and quantum optics.</p>

However, the recombination rate of these excitons is connected with the long-range magnetic order, and this connection probably arise from a spin-flip rooted in the underlying antiferromagnetic background during the recombination.

            <p>Ferroelectricity in perovskites is known to be suppressed by a moderate hydrostatic pressure. The notion that a polar instability should reappear in a higher pressure regime is well accepted theoretically but experiments have failed so far to provide a conclusive evidence for it. Here, we investigate a classical but comparatively underlooked ferroelectric perovskite KNbO3. We use single crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation to explore the phase transition sequence at high pressures up to 63 GPa. We show that the ferroelectric instability manifests itself in the emergence of an incommensurate modulation of the perovskite structure that combines cation displacements and tilts of the oxygen octahedra. Soft modes associated to the tilts and the modulation are clearly observed along with persistent order-disorder signatures. This demonstrates the presence of the high-pressure polar instability in a lead-free perovskite in spite of the centrosymmetric character of all observed high-pressure phases.</p>

            <p>Hybrid quantum dot (QD)-superconductor system can be used to realize Majorana zero modes in artificial Kitaev chains. These chains provide a promising platform for the realization of Majorana qubits. Radio-frequency (RF) gate reflectometry is a fast, non-invasive, and sensitive technique that can be used to read out such qubits. In this work, we use gate reflectometry to probe two QDs coupled via a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid segment. We demonstrate that gate sensing can resolve charge stability diagrams and clearly distinguish between elastic cotunneling and crossed-Andreev reflection, the two key processes that allow one to form a Kitaev chain. Furthermore, we show that this information is accessible, even when the system is completely decoupled from the from the normal leads. In this closed regime, we show that the observed quantum capacitance signal is indicative of parity switching between the even and odd ground states. Our measurements in both open and closed regimes confirm that gate reflectometry captures the essential features of interdot coupling and parity dynamics.</p>

            <h2>A quantum computing approach to efficiently simulating correlated materials using impurity models and dynamical mean field theory</h2>

            <p>The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Laws of Magnetically Driven High-order Harmonic Generation in Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ousmane Ly</p>
            <p>We investigate the scaling behavior of high harmonic generation (HHG) driven by magnetic dynamics in spin-orbit coupled systems. In contrast to optically driven HHG--where the harmonic cutoff scales as $\omega^{-3}$ with the driving frequency $\omega$--our time-dependent quantum transport simulations reveal a qualitatively distinct scaling law for magnetically driven HHG in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction: the harmonic cutoff $n_{\mathrm{max}}$ scales as $\omega^{-1}$. This fundamental difference arises from distinct excitation mechanisms--namely, spin-flip transitions driven by vectorial magnetic precession, as opposed to scalar electric fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the precession cone angle $\theta$ serves as a crucial control parameter. Increasing $\theta$ broadens the harmonic bandwidth, with peak emission achieved for nearly in-plane magnetic dynamics. Our findings establish magnetically driven HHG as a robust and tunable mechanism for nonlinear spin transport, governed by unique scaling laws with potential applications in ultrafast spintronic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Charge ordering and spontaneous topological Hall effect in bilayer skyrmion crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Hardy, Anjishnu Bose, Tanmay Grover, Arun Paramekanti</p>
            <p>Magnetic skyrmion crystals with zero net skyrmion charge and zero topological Hall response are interesting candidate phases which can occur at a vanishing magnetic field in centrosymmetric systems. We study a minimal bilayer model of skyrmion crystals having opposite chirality and topological charge in the two layers, and show that it can host nearly flat electronic bands with quasi-uniform Berry curvature and quantum metric. Using Hartree-Fock theory, we show that weak to moderate short-range electron interactions induce two distinct types of symmetry breaking patterns depending on the band dispersion: an intra-unit-cell charge density modulation from Chern band mixing or a layer-imbalanced phase with a nonzero ferroelectric polarization. Both phases break inversion symmetry leading to a spontaneous and large net topological Hall effect, with the phase diagram tunable by external electric fields. Our results may be relevant to centrosymmetric skyrmion materials such as Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ as well as artificially engineered heterostructures. We also discuss its relation to recent work on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea León, Carmine Autieri, Thomas Brumme, Jhon W. González</p>
            <p>The interplay of strong electronic correlations, sizable octahedral distortions, and pronounced spin--orbit coupling (SOC) makes perovskite oxides promising candidates for realizing altermagnetic phases. We study altermagnetic phases in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a non-centrosymmetric layered perovskite whose ground state is a Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnet. We show that an alternative Néel-type spin arrangement hosts a P-2 $d$-wave altermagnetic state with orbital selectivity similar to Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Including SOC generates a symmetry-allowed $p$-wave component and yields a hybrid $d$/$p$-wave altermagnetic order. We further demonstrate that biaxial strain tunes both magnetic stability and band splitting: compressive strain beyond 2\% favors the altermagnetic phase over the antiferromagnetic ground state, while tensile strain increases altermagnetic splittings by up to 9\%. To quantify these trends, we define an altermagnetic figure of merit and trace its strain dependence to changes in electronic localization and octahedral geometry in this polar metal.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tongyang Guan, Jiahao Liu, Wentao Qin, Yongwei Cui, Shunjia Wang, Yizheng Wu, Zhensheng Tao</p>
            <p>The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear projection for ballistic correlation functions: a formula in terms of minimal connected covers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Doyon</p>
            <p>In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, and is a nonlinear version of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing $n$-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every $d\geq 1$ spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities and, correspondingly, higher derivatives of local averages. Using Malyshev's formula for the cumulant expansion, and keeping the leading order, the result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum of products of correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. The sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call minimal connected covers. We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.</p>

            <h2>Decoherence of Majorana qubits by 1/f noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhijeet Alase, Marcus C. Goffage, Maja C. Cassidy, Susan N. Coppersmith</p>
            <p>Qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing, due to their promise of intrinsically low error rates enabled by topological protection. These error rates are expected to be suppressed exponentially with increasing nanowire length or decreasing temperature. Here we identify a fundamental decoherence mechanism that challenges this expectation. The high-frequency components of 1/f charge noise, ubiquitous in semiconductor devices, can excite quasiparticles in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which travel to the ends of the nanowire to poison the MZMs. This mechanism leads to qubit errors that grow with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the excitation rates for clean nanowires and show that this noise imposes a strict limit on the coherence times of the qubits currently being developed, reducing them to less than one microsecond even under ideal conditions. These timescales are significantly shorter than those required for gate operations, posing a serious obstacle to the scalability of Majorana-based quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$ is a quasi-one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, which makes it a model platform to explore this interplay. Here, we combine high-field magnetotransport measurements with density functional theory calculations to provide a comprehensive mapping of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ in its CDW phase. Using multiple current-field geometries, we resolve the four largest of six pockets of the FS predicted by theory and find no evidence of non-CDW bands, highlighting the full reconstruction of the FS in the bulk. We identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical pocket and uncover a large size orbit consistent with magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29~eV. Moreover, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance that persists across all field directions when current flows perpendicular to the 1D chains along which the CDW is formed, with a distinct high-field linear regime emerging when field is along the chains. These findings establish TaTe$_4$ as a prototypical material to study the coexistence of correlation-driven reconstruction and topological electronic states.</p>

            <p>Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it became clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared to the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described by continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of quantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by the helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the limit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level system, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of the problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously introduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our solution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric field. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state is not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We constructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution in time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited further to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum skyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum qudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum qubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based resource theory.</p>

            <p>The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.</p>

            <h2>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Utsumi, Yoshifumi Nakata</p>
            <p>Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits capable of recovering quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. These are applicable to both entanglement-assisted and non-assisted settings. By developing a technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the decoders, we show that they are applicable to any noise model. As a consequence, for any noisy channel, our decoders can be used to achieve a communication rate arbitrarily close to the quantum capacity by increasing the number of channel uses. To construct the decoders, we employ the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise. Our constructions offer advantages in the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previous explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</p>

            <p>In confluent cell monolayers, patterns of cell forces and motion are systematically altered near topological defects in cell shape. In turn, defects have been proposed to alter cell density, extrusion, and invasion, but it remains unclear how the defects form and how they affect cell forces and motion. Here, we studied +1/2 defects, and, in contrast to prior studies, we observed the concurrent occurrence of both tail-to-head and head-to-tail defect motion in the same cell monolayer. We quantified the cell velocities, the tractions at the cell-substrate interface, and the stresses within the cell layer near +1/2 defects. Results revealed that both traction and stress are sources of activity and dissipation within the epithelial cell monolayer, with the direction of motion of +1/2 defects depending on whether energy is injected by stresses or tractions. Interestingly, patterns of motion, traction, stress, and energy injection near +1/2 defects existed before defect formation, suggesting that defects form as a result of spatially coordinated patterns in cell forces and motion. These findings introduce a new focus, on coordinated patterns of force and motion that lead to defect formation and motion.</p>

            <p>We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the XXZ-staggered spin chain, also focusing on its noninteracting XX-staggered limit, and of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.</p>

            <p>We use concepts from quantum cryptography to relate the entanglement in many-body mixed states to standard correlation functions. If a system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment -- we can infer that the state of the system is entangled. For thermal states, we derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.</p>

            <p>Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pizzi, Claudio Castelnovo, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>Highly frustrated magnets, with their macroscopically-degenerate classical ground states and massively-entangled quantum spin liquid phases, have been pivotal to the development of modern condensed matter concepts such as emergent symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. The effects of frustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body dynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we identify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the form of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing'' configurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general neither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of dynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while allowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of unstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'', that is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On the product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum thermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the expected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product states. Our results reveal a new constrained dynamical regime where many-body quantum chaos coexists with structured manifolds of coherent dynamics, and establishes a mechanism for hitherto elusive extensive scarring.</p>

            <p>Microcavity exciton-polariton condensates under additional transverse confinement constitute a flexible optical platform to study the coupling mechanism between confined nonequilibrium and nonlinear states of matter. Driven far from equilibrium, polariton condensates can display spontaneous synchronization and instabilities depending on excitation and material parameters, showcasing emergent and intricate interference patterns based on mode competition over mutual gain landscapes. Here, we explore this coupling mechanism between polariton condensates populating the first excited ${\it p}$-state manifold of coupled optically trapped condensates and show a rich structure of patterns based on excitation parameters. The optical reconfigurability of the laser excitation patterns enables the creation of an annular-shaped beam to confine polaritons in a tailored trapping potential, whilst the dissipative nature of the optical traps enables effective interaction with neighboring condensates. Our results underpin the potential role of polariton condensates in exploring and simulating $\sigma$ and $\pi$ molecular bonding mechanisms between artificial two-dimensional diatomic orbitals and beyond.</p>

            <p>The class of unconventional superconductors, particularly noncentrosymmetric superconductors, has been highly considered as potential materials for understanding the complex properties of quantum materials. Here, five previously unreported Re3.5Os3.5Ta0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3Os3Ta0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3.5Os3.5Mo0.5Hf0.5Nb3, Re3.5Os3.5Mo0.5W0.5Nb3, and Re3Os3Mo0.5Hf0.5Nb3 Re-Os-based high/medium-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) with valence electron count ranging from 6.45 to 6.81 were synthesized and investigated using x-ray diffraction, transport, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. Our analyses confirm that all five compounds crystallize in a noncentrosymmetric {\alpha}-Mn-type structure and exhibit type-II superconductivity with Tc values from 4.20 K to 5.11 K, respectively. Unexpectedly, despite being immersed in an acidic environment for one month, the structures and superconducting properties of HEAs remain stable. Our findings indicate that the Tc increases with an increasing valence electron count in MEAs-HEAs. Furthermore, these noncentrosymmetric {\alpha}-Mn-type HEA superconductors have large Kadowaki-Woods ratios (KWR), implying the presence of strong electronic correlations.</p>

            <h2>Aharonov-Bohm interference from coherent spin-polarized edge transport in Fe(Te,Se) superconducting rings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Javadi Balakan, Shiva Heidari, Genda Gu, Qiang Li, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ji Ung Lee</p>
            <p>We report the coexistence of Aharonov-Bohm and Little-Parks oscillations in mesoscopic Fe(Te,Se) rings. The magnetoresistance shows two distinct periodicities: an $h/e$ component from ballistic edge interference and an $h/2e$ component from fluxoid quantization of Cooper pairs. Aharonov-Bohm oscillations persist deep into the superconducting phase, exhibit current-field symmetry, and follow a temperature dependence captured by a helical Luttinger liquid model, consistent with edge states in a topological superconductor.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting gap symmetry of 2DEG at (111)-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Czarnecki, M. Zegrodnik, P. Wójcik</p>
            <p>We investigate the superconducting properties of the two-dimensional electron gas at the (111) LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. Using a multiorbital tight-binding model defined on a hexagonal lattice, we analyze the emergence of superconductivity driven by both interlayer (nearest-neighbor) and intralayer (next-nearest-neighbor) pairing interactions, with a particular focus on the symmetry of the superconducting gap. We demonstrate that, in both pairing scenarios, the superconducting gap transforms according to the $A_1$ irreducible representation of the $C_{6v}$ point group. Within the interlayer pairing scenario, the superconducting phase is characterized by a fully gapped quasiparticle excitation spectrum exhibiting extended $s$-wave symmetry, accompanied by an enhancement of the superconducting gap magnitude in the vicinity of the van Hove singularity. Conversely, the intralayer pairing channel produces a distinctive double-dome structure in the superconducting phase diagram, with the gap symmetry evolving from a fully gapped, extended $s$-wave at low carrier densities to a nodal extended $s$-wave state at higher electron concentrations. The qualitative agreement with experimentally observed nonmonotonic behavior of the critical temperature $T_c(V_g)$ suggests that intralayer next-nearest-neighbor pairing may play a dominant role in the superconductivity of the (111) LAO/STO interface.</p>

            <h2>Quantum criticality and emergent orders in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic-Kitaev chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiling Wei, Zhengzhong Du, Xiaodong Cao, Wen-Long You, Yi Lu</p>
            <p>Higher-spin quantum magnets with competing interactions offer a rich platform for exploring quantum phases that transcend the paradigms of spin-1/2 systems, owing to their enlarged local Hilbert spaces and the emergence of multipolar correlations. We investigate a one-dimensional spin-1 chain where quadrupolar order is promoted by two distinct mechanisms: conventional bilinear-biquadratic exchange and bond-directional antiferromagnetic Kitaev frustration. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we determine the complete ground-state phase diagram and uncover two emergent phases induced by the Kitaev interaction: a Kitaev nematic phase and a Kitaev-dimer phase. The Kitaev nematic phase emerges from a fragile biquadratic dimer state via a continuous quantum phase transition in the Ising universality class. The Kitaev dimer phase spontaneously breaks a screw symmetry to favor either $x$- or $y$-spin bonding, forming a gapped state that coexists with a crystalline order of alternating $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes.</p>

            <h2>Many-body perturbation theory vs. density functional theory: A systematic benchmark for band gaps of solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Großmann, Marc Thieme, Malte Grunert, Erich Runge</p>
            <p>We benchmark many-body perturbation theory against density functional theory (DFT) for the band gaps of solids. We systematically compare four $GW$ variants $-$ $G_{0}W_{0}$ using the Godby-Needs plasmon-pole approximation ($G_{0}W_{0}$-PPA), full-frequency quasiparticle $G_{0}W_{0}$ (QP$G_{0}W_{0}$), full-frequency quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QS$GW$), and QS$GW$ augmented with vertex corrections in $W$ (QS$G\hat{W}$) $-$ against the currently best performing and popular density functionals mBJ and HSE06. Our results show that $G_{0}W_{0}$-PPA calculations offer only a marginal accuracy gain over the best DFT methods, however at a higher cost. Replacing the PPA with a full-frequency integration of the dielectric screening improves the predictions dramatically, almost matching the accuracy of the QS$G\hat{W}$. The QS$GW$ removes starting-point bias, but systematically overestimates experimental gaps by about $15\%$. Adding vertex corrections to the screened Coulomb interaction, i.e., performing a QS$G\hat{W}$ calculation, eliminates the overestimation, producing band gaps that are so accurate that they even reliably flag questionable experimental measurements.</p>

            <h2>Observe novel tricritical phenomena in self-organized Fermi gas induced by higher order Fermi surface nesting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yilun Xu, Feng-Xiao Sun, Qiongyi He</p>
            <p>Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and 2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover, there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and classical phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Third harmonic-mediated amplification in TWPA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Rizvanov, S. Kern, P. Neilinger, M. Grajcar</p>
            <p>In Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers, higher-order harmonics of the pump tone and its sidebands are commonly present and typically regarded as parasitic. Consequently, most design efforts have focused on suppressing these harmonics. In spite of that, motivated by transient simulations, we extend the coupled-mode theory and demonstrate that, contrary to conventional belief, the third harmonic can enhance amplifier performance, improving both gain and bandwidth. We show that the recently developed plasma oscillation-based amplifier is particularly well-suited for exploiting this effect. Their dispersion relation enables us to observe the phenomenon in transient numerical simulations using JoSIM and WRspice. These simulations reveal improvement of the amplifier's performance, specifically the doubling of the bandwidth and an increase in the gain.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced spin-to-charge conversion in La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$/NdNiO$_3$ bilayers at the nickelate metal-insulator phase transition</h2>

            <p>Phase transition materials such as NdNiO3 (NNO) when coupled with low damping ferromagnets such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) can lead to new multi-functional material systems harnessing the interplay of charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. In this study, we probe the evolution of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial all-oxide LSMO (12 nm)/NNO (4, 8, and 16 nm) bilayers. Using spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance we track the spin-charge conversion in the NNO layer through the paramagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator transition and observe a pronounced enhancement of the inverse spin Hall effect signal at the onset of this transition. We attribute this enhancement to the electronic and magnetic disorder in NNO at the first-order phase transition, thereby providing insights into the mechanism of spin transport through the phase transition. The tunability of spin charge conversion in this low damping bilayer system offers a pathway for developing multifunctional, energy-efficient spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Stacking-induced type-II quantum spin Hall insulators with high spin Chern number in unconventional magnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao-Yang Tan, Panjun Feng, Ze-Feng Gao, Fengjie Ma, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>Generally, stacking two monolayer type-I quantum spin Hall insulators gives rise to a trivial insulator. However, whether or not stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators results in a trivial insulator has not yet been explored. In this letter, based on the calculations of lattice model, we demonstrate that stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators does not yield a trivial insulator, but instead forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. In this phase, there are two pairs of topological edge states with opposite chirality and polarization coexisting in the boundary. Our calculations further reveal that the quantized spin Hall conductance of the bilayer is twice that of the monolayer. When U(1) symmetry is present, the high spin Chern number phase remains stable; when U(1) symmetry is broken, it persists over a broad parameter range. Furthermore, based on the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we propose that bilayer Nb$_2$SeTeO is a type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern number. Finally, extending this strategy to multilayer stacks naturally leads to quantum spin Hall insulator with larger spin Chern number. Our work not only deepens the distinction between type-I and type-II quantum spin Hall insulators, but also offers a route toward realizing highly quantized spin Hall conductance.</p>

            <h2>Disorder-induced stress-flow misalignment in soft glassy materials revealed using multi-directional shear</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frédéric Blanc, Guillaume Ovarlez, Adam Trigui, Kirsten Martens, Romain Mari</p>
            <p>Controlling the mechanical response of soft glassy materials, such as emulsions, foams, and colloidal suspensions, is key for many industrial processes. While their steady-state flow behavior is reasonably well understood, their response to complex flow histories, as encountered in operations like pumping or mixing, remains poorly known. Using a custom multi-axis shear apparatus that enables arbitrary changes in flow direction, we investigate how shear history influences the mechanical behavior of a model soft glassy system. We uncover a transient shear response orthogonal to the applied shear direction, together with an anisotropic yield surface. These effects point to an underlying anisotropic distribution of internal stresses imprinted by previous deformation. To rationalize this behavior, we use a mesoscopic elasto-plastic model, demonstrating that local mechanical disorder governs the emergence of macroscopic stress-flow misalignment. Our findings offer a new route to experimentally probe the distribution of local yield stresses in soft glassy materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum many-body scarring from Kramers-Wannier duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weslei B. Fontana, Fabrizio G. Oliviero, Yi-Ping Huang</p>
            <p>Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding conditions for scarring. This is supported by striking agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results suggest that non-invertible dualities provide both a generative mechanism for new QMBS and a diagnostic for their stability.</p>
