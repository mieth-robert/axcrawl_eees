            <h2>Intermittent shot noise generating 1/f fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ferdinand Grueneis</p>
            <p>When the rate of shot noise is controlled by on-off states we speak of intermittent shot noise. The on-off states lead to alternately occurring clusters of events and intermissions, respectively. We derive the power spectrum of the intermittent shot noise by applying the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. Besides reduced shot noise, we obtain excess noise, which depends on the parameters of the on-off states. We calculate the excess noise for power-law distributed on-states; within the scaling region, the excess noise is excellently approximated by C/f^b. The behavior of the slope b and of the amplitude C in dependence of the on-off times is investigated. For large scaling regions we find a preference for a pure 1/f shape. Finally, we regard the variance of events occurring within a time interval. In the presence of 1/f fluctuations, the variance of counts attains extreme values which are accompanied by an extreme property of slope b.</p>

            <h2>In situ and real-time ultrafast spectroscopy of photoinduced reactions in perovskite nanomaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gi Rim Han, Mai Ngoc An, Hyunmin Jang, Noh Soo Han, JunWoo Kim, Kwang Seob Jeong, Tai Hyun Yoon, Minhaeng Cho</p>
            <p>Employing two synchronized mode-locked femtosecond lasers and interferometric detection of the pump-probe spectra -- referred to as asynchronous and interferometric transient absorption (AI-TA) -- we have developed a method for broad dynamic range and rapid data acquisition. Using AI-TA, we examined photochemical changes during femtosecond pump-probe experiments on all-inorganic cesium lead halide nanomaterials, including perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) and nanoplatelets (PeNPLs). The laser pulse train facilitates photoreactions while allowing real-time observation of charge carrier dynamics. In PeNCs undergoing halide anion photo-substitution, transient absorption spectra showed increasing bandgap energy and faster relaxation dynamics as the Cl/Br ratio increased. For colloidal PeNPLs, continuous observation revealed both spectral and kinetic changes during the light-induced coalescence of nanoplatelets, by analyzing temporal segments. This integrated technique not only deepens understanding of exciton dynamics and environmental influences in perovskite nanomaterials but also establishes AI-TA as a transformative tool for real-time observation of photochemical dynamics.</p>

            <h2>An Overview of Josephson Junctions Based QPUs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omid Mohebi, Alireza Hesam Mohseni</p>
            <p>Quantum processing units (QPUs) based on superconducting Josephson junctions promise significant advances in quantum computing. However, they face critical challenges. Decoherence, scalability limitations, and error correction overhead hinder practical, fault-tolerant implementations. This paper investigates these issues by exploring both fundamental quantum phenomena and practical engineering challenges. We analyze key quantum mechanical principles such as superposition, entanglement, and decoherence that govern the behavior of superconducting qubits. We also discuss quantum tunneling, Cooper pair formation, and the operational mechanics of Josephson junctions in detail. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis with alternative architectures, including ion trap and photonic systems. This comparison highlights the unique advantages and trade-offs of Josephson junction-based QPUs. Our findings emphasize the critical role of material innovations and optimized control techniques. These advances are essential for mitigating noise and decoherence and for realizing robust, scalable quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced coherent terahertz emission from critical superconducting fluctuations in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.6}$</h2>

            <p>Coherent terahertz (THz) emission is emerging as a powerful new tool to probe symmetry breakings in quantum materials. This method relies on second order optical nonlinearities and is complementary to second harmonic generation spectroscopy. Here, we report coherent THz emission from Josephson plasmons in underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, and find that the amplitude of the emitted field increases dramatically close to the superconducting transition temperature, $T_C$. We show theoretically how emission is enhanced by critical superconducting fluctuations, a nonlinear analogue of critical opalescence. This observation is expected to be of general importance for the study of many thermal and quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Key Distribution over Complex Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Mariani, Raja Yehia, Carlos Pascual-García, Federico Centrone, Jasper van der Kolk, M. Ángeles Serrano, Antonio Acín</p>
            <p>There exist several initiatives worldwide to deploy quantum key distribution (QKD) over existing fibre networks and achieve quantum-safe security at large scales. To understand the overall QKD network performance, it is required to transition from the analysis of individual links, as done so far, to the characterization of the network as a whole. In this work, we undertake this study by embedding QKD protocols on complex networks, which correctly model the existing fiber networks. We focus on networks with trusted nodes and on continuous-variable (CV) schemes, which have much higher key rates than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts. In the effective CV network, however, many of the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the presence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical distance for CV systems. These properties can be restored when considering a hybrid network consisting of both CV and DV protocols, achieving at the same time high average rate and inter-connectivity. Our work opens the path to the study of QKD complex networks in existing infrastructures.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Diffusional Hydrogen Escape in High-$T_c$ Superconducting Calcium Superhydride at Megabar Pressures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xixi Jia, Haoran Chen, Xiaoqiu Ye, Jian Lv, Xitian Zhang, Hui Wang, Yansun Yao</p>
            <p>High-pressure metal superhydrides have attracted intense scientific interest due to their remarkable superconducting properties. While superconductivity is known to be sensitive to material composition, compositional variability is often overlooked in metal superhydrides at megabar pressures. Using ab initio path-integral simulations, we find that up to 7 % of the hydrogen atoms escape from the 215-kelvin superconducting CaH$_6$ upon decompression from 165 to 123 GPa. This loss of hydrogen leads to an elastic instability at low pressures, an "abnormal" positive pressure dependence of the superconducting $T_c$ and a quantum phase transition from a mixed superconducting-diffusive state to a pure superconducting phase. In this mixed phase, proton diffusivity reaches $10^{-8}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at low temperatures and promotes to $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at room temperature, which elucidates the escape of hydrogen at megabar pressures. Our results are consistent with many "anomalous" experimental observations and highlight the significance of composition effects in high-$T_c$ metal superhydrides.</p>

            <h2>Near room-temperature ferromagnetism from double-exchange in the van der Waals material CrGeTe$_3$: evidence from optical conductivity under pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihaan Ebad-Allah, Daniel Guterding, Meera Varma, Mangesh Diware, Shraddha Ganorkar, Harald O. Jeschke, Christine A. Kuntscher</p>
            <p>The unexpected discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in layered van der Waals materials has sparked interest in both their fundamental properties and their potential for novel applications. Recent studies suggest near room-temperature ferromagnetism in the pressurized van der Waals crystal CrGeTe$_3$. We perform a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetism and electronic correlations in CrGeTe$_3$, combining broad-frequency reflectivity measurements with density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Our experimental optical conductivity spectra trace the signatures of developing ferromagnetic order and of the insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) as a function of temperature and hydrostatic pressure. With increasing pressure, we observe the emergence of a mid-infrared feature in the optical conductivity, indicating the development of strong orbital-selective correlations in the high-pressure ferromagnetic phase. We find a distinct relationship between the plasma frequency and Curie temperature of CrGeTe$_3$, which strongly suggests that a double-exchange mechanism is responsible for the observed near room-temperature ferromagnetism. Our results clearly demonstrate the existence of a charge-transfer gap in the metallic phase, ruling out its previously conjectured collapse under pressure.</p>

            <h2>Topological Majorana zero modes and the superconducting diode effect driven by Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing in a helical Shiba chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Bhowmik, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in our system where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the presence of finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO ground state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the superconducting diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</p>

            <h2>Surface-dependent Majorana vortex phases in topological crystalline insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun-Jiang Luo, Xiao-Hong Pan, Yilin Shi, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>The topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits two types of surface Dirac cones: one located at non-time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (001) and (110) surfaces, and the other at time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (111) surface. Motivated by the recent experimental evidence of Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) and their hybridization on the (001) surface [Nature 633, 71 (2024)], we present a comprehensive investigation of Majorana vortex phases in SnTe, including topological classification, surface-state Hamiltonians analysis, and lattice model calculations. By utilizing rotational and magnetic mirror symmetries, we present two equivalent methods to reveal the topology of Majorana phases on different surfaces. We find that the MVEMs on the (001) and (110) surfaces are protected by both magnetic group and rotational symmetries. In contrast, the MVEMs on the (111) surface are protected by magnetic group or particle-hole symmetry. Due to the different properties of Dirac fermions in the $\bar{\Gamma}$ and $\bar{M}$ valleys on the (111) surfaces, including Fermi velocities and energy levels, we find that abundant vortex phase transitions can occur for the [111]-direction vortex. As the chemical potential increases, the number of robust MVEMs can change from $0\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2$. These vortex transitions are characterized by both $Z$ winding number and $Z_2$ pfaffian topological invariants.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Quantum Darwinism and the Origin of Classicality with Superconducting Circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zitian Zhu, Kiera Salice, Akram Touil, Zehang Bao, Zixuan Song, Pengfei Zhang, Hekang Li, Zhen Wang, Chao Song, Qiujiang Guo, H. Wang, Rubem Mondaini</p>
            <p>The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</p>

            <h2>Indirect Excitons and Many-body Interactions in InGaAs Double Quantum Wells</h2>

            <p>Spatially indirect excitons in semiconductor quantum wells are relevant to basic research and device applications because they exhibit enhanced tunability, delocalized wave functions, and potentially longer lifetimes relative to direct excitons. Here we investigate the properties of indirect excitons and their coupling interactions with direct excitons in asymmetric InGaAs double quantum wells using optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Analyses of the spectra confirm a strong influence of many-body effects, and reveal that excited-state zero-quantum coherences between direct and indirect excitons in the quantum wells dephase faster than the much higher-energy single-quantum coherences between excitonic excited states and ground states. The results also suggest an important energy-dependent role of continuum states in mediating system dynamics, and they indicate that dephasing mechanisms are associated with uncorrelated or anticorrelated energy-level fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors</h2>

            <p>It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</p>

            <h2>Plasmonic Crystals with Tunable Band Gaps in the Grating Gate Transistor Structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. R. Aizin, J. Mikalopas, M. Shur</p>
            <p>We developed a hydrodynamic model of plasmonic crystals formed in the current-driven grating gate transistor structures. The model demonstrates that the quality factor of plasmonic resonances could be increased by using ungated regions with high electron densities connecting multiple plasmonic cavities. The analytical and numerical calculations of the EM radiation absorption by the band plasmons show that the drive current makes all plasma modes optically active by breaking the symmetry of the plasma oscillations. This effect results in splitting plasmon resonant absorption peaks revealing the gaps in the plasmonic band spectrum tunable by current. The analyzed design could achieve resonant behavior at room temperature for plasmonic crystals implemented in various material systems, including graphene, III-V, III-N materials, and p-diamond. We argue that the resulting double-peak spectrum line in the terahertz range also facilitates the absorption at the gap frequency, typically in microwave range. Power pumping at the gap frequency enables excitation of the gap plasmons, promoting frequency conversion from microwave to THz ranges. The flexibility in the length of the ungated region for the investigated structures allows for an effective coupling with THz radiation, with the metal grating acting as a distributive resonant antenna. The applications of the presented results extend to THz communication systems, THz sensing and imaging, frequency conversion systems, and other advanced THz plasmonic devices.</p>

            <h2>High-Chern-number Quantum anomalous Hall insulators in mixing-stacked MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaheng Li, Quansheng Wu, Hongming Weng</p>
            <p>Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators are characterized by vanishing longitudinal resistance and quantized Hall resistance in the absence of an external magnetic field. Among them, high-Chern-number QAH insulators offer multiple nondissipative current channels, making them crucial for the development of low-power-consumption electronics. Using first-principles calculations, we propose that high-Chern-number ($C>1$) QAH insulators can be realized in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) multilayer films through the combination of mixed stacking orders, eliminating the need for additional buffer layers. The underlying physical mechanism is validated by calculating real-space-resolved anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Local AHC is found to be predominantly located in regions with consecutive correct stacking orders, contributing to quasi-quantized AHC. Conversely, regions with consecutive incorrect stacking contribute minimally to the total AHC, which can be attributed to the varied interlayer coupling in different stacking configurations. Our work provides valuable insights into the design principle for achieving large Chern numbers, and highlights the role of stacking configurations in manipulating electronic and topological properties in MBT films and its derivatives.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity up to 17 K in the high-pressure rhombohedral-I phase of ReO3: a potential oxide analogy of hydride superconductors</h2>

            <p>As an A-site-vacant perovskite-type oxide, ReO3 undergoes sequential pressure-driven structural transitions associated with the rotation of ReO6 octahedra. The rhombohedral-I phase in the pressure range of 12-39 GPa is featured by a lattice of nearly close-packed oxygen layers intercalated with Re cations, in reminiscent of the recently discovered superhydride superconductors. A combined study of first-principles calculations and transport measurements under high pressures enabled us to discover superconductivity in the rhombohedral-I phase, and it shows a dome-shaped Tc(P) with a maximum Tc of 17 K at about 30 GPa. In addition to the enhanced density of states at Fermi level compared to that of the ambient phase, the vibrations of hexagonal-close-packed oxygen lattice significantly strengthen the electron-phonon coupling, which is responsible for observed superconductivity with a relatively high Tc. The present work thus establishes a rare case among oxide superconductors that the light-element oxygen lattice plays a crucial role in inducing superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Sasioglu, M. Tas, S. Ghosh, W. Beida, B. Sanyal S. Blugel, I. Mertig, I. Galanakis</p>
            <p>Gapped metals, a recently proposed class of materials, possess a band gap slightly above or below the Fermi level, behaving as intrinsic p- or n-type semiconductors without requiring external doping. Inspired by this concept, we propose a novel material class: "spin gapped metals". These materials exhibit intrinsic p- or n-type character independently for each spin channel, similar to dilute magnetic semiconductors but without the need for transition metal doping. A key advantage of spin gapped metals lies in the absence of band tails that exist within the band gap of conventional p- and n-type semiconductors. Band tails degrade the performance of devices like tunnel field-effect transistors (causing high subthreshold slopes) and negative differential resistance tunnel diodes (resulting in low peak-to-valley current ratios). Here, we demonstrate the viability of spin gapped metals using first-principles electronic band structure calculations on half-Heusler compounds. Our analysis reveals compounds displaying both gapped metal and spin gapped metal behavior, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional devices in spintronics and nanoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Chang, Hantao Lu, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yang Ding</p>
            <p>Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.</p>

            <p>FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell applications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the low-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open questions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the arrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned potential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural characteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral tilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the low temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in a metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By comparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good agreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors experimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the experimental challenges in accessing the true ground state. These findings provide critical insights into the fundamental physics of FAPbI$_3$ and its low-temperature behavior, advancing our understanding of this technologically important material.</p>

The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. Additionally, we report measurements of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of two Nb SRF cavities processed using distinct methods. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</p>

In contrast, all other functional perovskite oxides, namely bulk V2O5, BaSnO3, PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3, and BiFeO3, show direct band gap interband transitions, with Eg values of 2.27, 3.25, 3.10, and 2.48 eV, respectively. The estimated Urbach energy (EU) values related to the induced defects in these direct band gap functional oxides are approximately 0.24, 0.38, 0.25, and 0.48 eV, respectively. Moreover, a reduction in the band gap energy of multiferroic BiFeO3 was observed due to induced chemical pressure from (Ba, Ca) doping and a decrease in particle size. Importantly, the evaluated band gap and Urbach energies of the functional perovskite oxide materials obtained from the analyses of the first derivative of reflectance and the Tauc plot method align remarkably well with the values deduced using the Kubelka-Munk function theory. Effectively, we propose a comprehensive electronic band structure for the multiferroic BiFeO3, an important material for optoelectronic applications such as photovoltaic, photocatalytic, and photoferroelectric devices.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast Spontaneous Exciton Dissociation via Phonon Emission in BiVO$_4$</h2>

            <p>Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO$_4$) is a promising indirect band gap semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here, we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of m-BiVO$_4$. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties of complex materials.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Generation of Higher-order Spin-Orbit Couplings, Topology and Persistent Spin Texture in Light-Irradiated Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayed Ali Akbar Ghorashi, Qiang Li</p>
            <p>Altermagnets have been identified as the third category of magnetic materials, exhibiting momentum-dependent spin splitting characterized by even powers of momentum. In this study, we show that when subjected to elliptically polarized light, these materials serve as an exemplary framework for the dynamic generation of topological bands featuring higher-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Notably, while the generated Zeeman field remains invariant to the particular altermagnetic ordering, the induced higher-order SOCs are related to the magnitude and symmetry of the altermagnetic order. Specifically, we show that an altermagnet exhibiting $k^n$-spin splitting can generate spin-orbit couplings up to $k^{n-1}$. In the limit of circularly polarized light, the only correction is $k^{n-1}$, with all lower-order contributions being nullified. Interestingly, light-induced SOCs significantly impact the low-energy band topology, where their Chern numbers change by $\Delta C =\pm 1,2,3$ for $d,g,f$-wave altermagnets. Finally, we find a critical field in which a persistent spin texture is realized, a highly desirable state with predicted infinite spin lifetime. Our work showcases light as a powerful, controllable tool for engineering complex and exciting phenomena in altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Interface-Generated Spin Current Induced Magnetoresistance in RuO2/Py Heterostructures</h2>

            <p>Altermagnets, a recently discovered class of magnetic materials exhibiting ferromagnetic-like spin-split bands and antiferromagnetic-like compensated magnetic order, have attracted significant interest for next-generation spintronic applications. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has emerged as a promising altermagnetic candidate due to its compensated antiparallel magnetic order and strong spin-split electronic bands. However, recent experimental and theoretical reports also suggest that RuO2 may be non-magnetic in its ground state, underscoring the need for deeper investigations into its magnetic character. Specifically, the (100)-oriented RuO2 films are expected to generate spin currents with transverse spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector. Here, we investigate magnetotransport in epitaxial RuO2/Permalloy (Py) heterostructures to examine spin Hall magnetoresistance and interfacial effects generated in such systems. Our measurements reveal a pronounced negative angular-dependent magnetoresistance for variation of magnetic field direction perpendicular to the charge current direction. Detailed temperature-, magnetic field-, and crystallographic orientation-dependent measurements indicate that interface-generated spin current (IGSC) at the RuO2/Py interface predominantly governs the observed magnetoresistance. This shows that strong interface effects dominate over possible altermagnetic contributions from RuO2. Our results show that the role of interface-generated spin currents is crucial and should not be overlooked in studies of altermagnetic systems. A critical step in this direction is disentangling interfacial from altermagnetic contributions. The insight into interfacial contributions from altermagnetic influences is essential for the advancement of RuO2 based spintronic memory and sensing applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Magno O. Pereira, Denise Assafrão, Frankbelson dos S. Azevedo, A. G. de Lima, Cleverson Filgueiras, Edilberto O. Silva</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the photoionization cross-section of an electron confined in a quantum dot, considering the position-dependent variation of the effective mass through the parameter $\gamma$. We used a theoretical model based on the Schrödinger equation, in which $\gamma$ influences the energy levels and wave functions through an effective potential obtained from the harmonic oscillator potential - which, in the limit $\gamma = 0$, reduces to the original harmonic oscillator potential. Furthermore, we compared the modifications in the photoionization cross-section of these quantum systems with the constant-mass case. Our results demonstrate that even a small variation in $\gamma$ significantly impacts the photoionization process's amplitude and peak position. We also found that for specific values of $\gamma$, an inversion occurs: The amplitude, which initially increases as the quantum dot absorbs the photon, begins to decrease. Additionally, we observed that the optical transitions involving the ground state restrict the admissible values of $\gamma$ to negative values only. These results may have relevant implications for designing optoelectronic devices based on quantum dots with adjustable mass properties.</p>

            <h2>Chemical Pressure Tuning of Multipolar and Magnetic Orders in Ba$_2$(Cd$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$)ReO$_6$ Double Perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koki Shibuya, Daigorou Hirai, Koshi Takenaka</p>
            <p>Double perovskite compounds containing 5d transition metal elements have been extensively studied as platforms for multipolar order phenomena stemming from spin-orbit-entangled 5d electrons. In this study, we examine the interplay between crystal structure, multipolar order, and magnetic order in solid solutions of double perovskites with the 5d1 electronic configuration: Ba2CdReO6 and Ba2CaReO6, which exhibit distinct electronic orders. The substitution of larger Ca2+ ions for Cd2+ in Ba2CdReO6, systematically increases the lattice constant with increasing the amount of substitution x. Although the spin-orbit-entangled J = 3/2 state remains intact upon substitution, both the quadrupolar order below Tq = 25 K and the canted antiferro-magnetic (AFM) order below Tm = 12 K in Ba2CdReO6 are progressively suppressed as x increases. Magnetization measurements reveal that the canted AFM order is suppressed at x = 0.6, transitioning to a colinear AFM order, while the quadrupolar order persists up to x = 0.9. The experimental electronic phase diagram, summarizing the dependence of electronic orders on lattice constants, aligns well with the theoretical phase diagram considering electric quadrupolar interactions [G. Chen et al., Phys. Rev. B 82, 174440 (2010)]. This correspondence confirms that chemical pressure induced by substitution effectively tunes the interaction between 5d electrons. The results highlight the potential of chemical pressure to modulate multipolar interactions, paving the way for novel multipolar properties in 5d electron systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the steady propagation of 180-degree domain walls (180DWs) of Néel vectors in thin antiferromagnetic strips under perpendicularly injected spin currents with various polarization orientations. Our results show that only spin currents polarized normally to the strip plane guarantee a quick and steady rigid flow of 180DWs, thus realize a fast reversal of Néel vectors in antiferromagnets (AFMs). Different from the common ``current-in-plane'' geometry which is feasible only for metallic AFMs, our ``current-out-of-plane'' layout under investigation can further apply to insulating AFMs (which are more common in real applications) via quantum tunneling effect. Results from this work paves the way for fine control of Néel vectors in (both metallic and insulating) AFM strips and further development of novel magnetic nanodevices based on them.</p>

            <p>Advancing quantum information and communication technology (qICT) requires smaller and faster components with actively controllable functionalities. This work presents a novel strategy for dynamically modulating magnetic properties via proximity effects controlled by light. We demonstrate this concept using hybrid nanoscale systems composed of C60 molecules proximitized to a cobalt metallic ferromagnetic surface, where proximity interactions are particularly strong. Our findings show that by inducing excitons in the C60 molecules with resonant ultrashort light pulses, we can significantly modify the interaction at the cobalt/C60 interface, leading to a striking 60% transient shift in the frequency of the dipolar ferromagnetic resonance mode of the Cobalt. This effect, detected via a specifically designed time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (tr-MOKE) experiment, persists on a timescale of hundreds of picoseconds. Since this frequency shift directly correlates with a transient change in the anisotropy field (an essential parameter for technological applications) our findings establish a new paradigm for ultrafast optical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arindam Boruah, Saumen Acharjee, Prasanta Kumar Saikia</p>
            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) are an exotic class of antiferromagnet that exhibit spin-splitting even at the absence of net global magnetization and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. In this work, we investigated theoretically, the supercurrent nonreciprocity in an Ising Superconductor/Altermagnet/Ising Superconductor (ISC/AM/ISC) Josephson junction which revealed asymmetric Josephson critical currents, $0 - \pi$ transitions and anomalous current-phase relationship (CPR). A strong Josephson diode efficiency (JDE) is observed due to the combined effects of AM strength and orientations in a conventional SC even in absence of SOC. However, it significantly enhances in presence of intrinsic SOC (ISOC), resulting in pronounced diode effect in both single and double band ISC/AM based Josephson junction. Additionally, it is observed that JDE is more prominent at higher AM strengths with intermediate orientations in all scenario. Notably, it is significantly suppressed for orientations $0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$. Our results also indicate that barrier transparency and AM lengths play a crucial role in optimizing the JDE. In a single-band ISC/AM system JDE persists for any AM length, while reduces at longer AM junction in case of a double-band ISC/AM system. Moreover, our results suggest that a diode efficiency of $\sim 52\%$ can be achieved in the proposed Josephson junction in both single and double band ISC/AM Josephson junction by considering strong AM strength. Furthermore, single band ISC offers wide AM orientation range in contrast to double band ISC for better tunability and optimization of JDE. Our findings highlight the impact of AM strength, orientation and ISOC on the JDE efficiency offering insights for superconducting diode design.</p>

            <p>Utilizing ab initio simulations, we study the spin-dependent electronic transport characteristics within Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$-based van der Waals heterostructures. The electronic density of states for both free-standing and device-configured Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ (F4GT) confirms its ferromagnetic metallic nature and reveals a weak interface interaction between F4GT and PtTe$_2$ electrodes, enabling efficient spin filtering. We observe a decrease in the magnetic anisotropy energy of F4GT in the device configuration, indicating reduced stability of magnetic moments and heightened sensitivity to external conditions. The transmission eigenstates of PtTe$_2$/ monolayer F4GT/PtTe$_2$ heterostructures demonstrate interference patterns affected by relative phases and localization, notably different in the spin-up and spin-down channels. The ballistic transport through a double-layer F4GT with a ferromagnetic configuration sandwiched between two PtTe$_2$ electrodes is predicted to exhibit an impressive spin polarization of 97$\%$ with spin-up electrons exhibiting higher transmission probability than spin-down electrons. Moreover, we investigate the spin transport properties of Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$/GaTe/Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures sandwiched between PtTe$_2$ electrodes to explore their potential as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in spintronic devices. The inclusion of GaTe as a 2D semiconducting spacer between F4GT layers results in a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 487$\%$ at low bias and decreases with increasing bias voltage. In general, our findings underscore the potential of F4GT / GaTe / F4GT heterostructures to advance spintronic devices based on van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p>The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</p>

            <p>Optical detection of magnetic resonance using quantum spin sensors (QSS) provides a spatially local and sensitive technique to probe spin dynamics in magnets. However, its utility as a probe of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) remains an open question. We report the first experimental demonstration of optically detected AFMR in layered van der Waals antiferromagnets (AF) up to frequencies of 24 GHz. We leverage QSS spin relaxation due to low-frequency magnetic field fluctuations arising from collective dynamics of magnons excited by the uniform AFMR mode. First, through AFMR spectroscopy we characterize the intrinsic exchange fields and magnetic anisotropies of the AF. Second, using the localized sensitivity of the QSS we demonstrate magnon transport over tens of micrometers. Finally, we find that optical detection efficiency increases with increasing frequency. This showcases the dual capabilities of QSS as detectors of high frequency magnetization dynamics and magnon transport, paving the way for understanding and controlling the magnetism of antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>A multiferroic state with both electric polarization ($P$) and magnetization ($M$) shows the inherently strong $P$-$M$ coupling, when $P$ is induced by cycloidal (Néel-wall like) spin modulation. The sign of $P$ is determined by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, we report the current-induced magnetoelectric control of the multiferroics in a helimagnetic metal YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment $T \sim P \times M \sim (\hat{q} \times \chi_v) \times M$ as well as with the magneto-chirality $\chi_v \times M$, where $\hat{q}$ and $\chi_v$ being the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. We furthermore observe an enhancement of NRR by the spin-cluster scattering via $\chi_v$ and its fluctuation. These findings may pave a way to exploration of multiferroic conductors and application of the spin-helicity degree of freedom as a state-variable.</p>

We further show that, for a subwavelegnth lattice, the isolation ratio for the nonreciprocal transmission is determined solely by $\text{Im}(\mathbf{k})$ instead of the extensively studied real part $\text{Re}(\mathbf{k})$. Our finding contradicts the common belief that "spectral nonreciprocity [$\omega(\mathbf{k})\neq\omega(-\mathbf{k})$] always implies nonreciprocal transmission".</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cécile Aprili, Gwennou Coupier, Élise Lorenceau, Benjamin Dollet</p>
            <p>Aqueous foams are solid materials composed of gases and liquids, exhibiting a large gas/liquid surface area and enabling dynamic exchanges between their fluid components. The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the foam structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial (or osmotic) pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO$_2$-laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a non-linear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam's soap films ($\neq 1$ for CO$_2/$air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.</p>

            <p>We show that the braiding of anyons in a quantum spin liquid leaves a distinct dynamical signature in the nonlinear pump-probe response. Using a combination of exact diagonalization and matrix product state techniques, we study the nonlinear pump-probe response of the toric code in a magnetic field, a model which hosts mobile electric $e$ and magnetic $m$ anyonic excitations. While the linear response signal oscillates and decays with time like $\sim t^{-1.3}$, the amplitude of the nonlinear signal for $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$ features a linear-in-time enhancement at early times. The comparison between $\chi^{(3)}_{XZZ}$, which involves the non-trivial braiding of $e$ and $m$ anyons, and $\chi^{(3)}_{XXX}$ that involves the trivial braiding of the same types of anyons, serves to distinguish the braiding statistics of anyons. We support our analysis by constructing a hard-core anyon model with statistical gauge fields to develop further insights into the time dependence of the pump-probe response. Pump-probe spectroscopy provides a distinctive new probe of quantum spin liquid states, beyond the inconclusive broad features observed in single spin flip inelastic neutron scattering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Zhang, Zhiheng Huang, Muchen Du, Tianping Ying, Luojun Du, Tiantian Zhang</p>
            <p>Circularly polarized phonons with nonzero angular momentum (AM), also referred to as chiral phonons, have garnered increasing attention in recent studies. Many existing experimental/theoretical works identify chiral phonons based on pseudo-angular momentum (PAM) or the flipping of the polarization of the circularly polarized light (CPL) in the Raman scattering process. However, the accuracy and universality of these assumptions remain to be verified. Moreover, in condensed matter physics, symmetry strongly governs the scattering and interactions of phonons, quasi-particles, and external fields, profoundly affecting correlated physical phenomena. In this study, we first conduct an in-depth examination of the distinctions and interconnections among AM, PAM, helicity, and atomic motion--key characteristics inherent to chiral phonons--and then undertake a comprehensive study of phonon chirality, as well as their associated physical quantities, and experimental benchmarks under various magnetic point groups. By developing the symmetry-based framework for phonon chirality across magnetic point groups, we demonstrate that identifying chiral phonons solely through nonzero PAM or CPL polarization inversion is inadequate, challenging prior findings. This framework clarifies the relationship between symmetry and phonon chirality, revealing that phonon modes governed by different symmetries exhibit distinct experimental signatures, thereby advancing our understanding of these phenomena. Finally, experiments on five materials with distinct symmetries are conducted to validate our theoretical results. Supported by both theoretical rigor and experimental validation, our study represents a significant step forward in advancing research on symmetry-constrained phonons.</p>

            <p>The edge structure of a gate-defined compressible quantum Hall fluids in the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 is studied using the three reconstructed $e^2/3h$ fractional edge modes of unity filling integer quantum Hall state. We find that the individually excited partially resolved $e^2/3h$ edge modes of the bulk state equilibrate completely even at higher magnetic field when passing through the gate defined compressible fluid with filling between 2/3 and 1. This result is unexpected because edge reconstruction at the smooth boundary is generally expected due to dominant incompressibility at filling 2/3 and 1/3. Recently such reconstructed edge mode has been reported for the compressible fluid in the filling fraction range 1/3 to 2/3. In contrary, equilibration of fractional edge modes in the compressible fluid within the filling fraction range 2/3 to 1 becomes faster with increasing magnetic field. This anomalous results will stimulate further investigations on edge structure in these complex many body systems.</p>

A terahertz-pumped single-mode cavity photon couples to a spin-phonon chain, while the system dissipates energy via different baths. Our mean-field analysis reveals that the photon induces magnetization switching by generating strongly entangled magnon pairs with opposite momenta -- a feature weakly present in the cavity-free system. This switching occurs only at specific drive frequencies, namely at low magnon energies and near the upper edge (perpendicular modes) of the two-magnon band. Our results underscore the roles of laser fluence, damping, and photon loss in modulating the switching process, offering a promising route for cavity-assisted magnetization control in opto-spintronics.</p>

            <p>A topological superconductor, characterized by either a chiral order parameter or a chiral topological surface state in proximity to bulk superconductivity, is foundational to topological quantum computing. As in other topological phases of matter, electronic correlations can tune topological superconductivity via modifications of the low-energy Fermiology. Such tuning has not been realized so far. Here we uncover a unique topological superconducting phase in competition with electronic correlations in 10-unit-cell thick FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ films grown on SrTiO$_{3}$ substrates. When the Te content $x$ exceeds $0.7$, we observe a rapid increase of the effective mass for the Fe $d_{xy}$ band, with the emergence of a superconducting topological surface state confirmed by high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy; however, near the FeTe limit, the system enters an incoherent regime where the topological surface state becomes unidentifiable and superconductivity is suppressed. Theory suggests that the electron-electron interactions in the odd-parity $xy^-$ band with a strong $d_{xy}$ character lead to an orbital-selective correlated phase. Our work establishes FeTe$_{x}$Se$_{1-x}$ thin films as a unique platform where electronic correlations sensitively modulate topological superconductivity, suggesting opportunities to use tunable electron-electron interactions to engineer new topological phases in a broad class of materials.</p>

            <h2>Extremely high excitonic $g$-factors in 2D crystals by alloy-induced admixing of band states</h2>

Molas</p>
            <p>Monolayers (MLs) of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (\mbox{S-TMDs}) emit light very efficiently and display rich spin-valley physics, with gyromagnetic ($g$-) factors of about -4. Here, we investigate how these properties can be tailored by alloying. Magneto-optical spectroscopy is used to reveal the peculiar properties of excitonic complexes in Mo$_{x}$W$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ MLs with different Mo and W concentrations. We show that the alloys feature extremely high $g$-factors for neutral excitons, that change gradually with the composition up to reaching values of the order of -10 for $x \approx 0.2$. First-principles calculations corroborate the experimental findings and provide evidence that alloying in S-TMDs results in a non-trivial band structure engineering, being at the origin of the high $g$-factors. The theoretical framework also suggests a higher strain sensitivity of the alloys, making them promising candidates for tailor-made optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>A multiferroic state with both electric polarization ($P$) and magnetization ($M$) shows the inherently strong $P$-$M$ coupling, when $P$ is induced by cycloidal (Néel-wall like) spin modulation. The sign of $P$ is determined by clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, we report the current-induced magnetoelectric control of the multiferroics in a helimagnetic metal YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment $T \sim P \times M \sim (\hat{q} \times \chi_v) \times M$ as well as with the magneto-chirality $\chi_v \times M$, where $\hat{q}$ and $\chi_v$ being the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. We furthermore observe an enhancement of NRR by the spin-cluster scattering via $\chi_v$ and its fluctuation. These findings may pave a way to exploration of multiferroic conductors and application of the spin-helicity degree of freedom as a state-variable.</p>

            <p>Magnonics is an emerging field widely considered as a paradigm shift in information technology that uses spin waves for data storage, processing and transmission. However, the coherent control of spin waves in 2D magnets still remains a challenge. Herein, we investigate the interplay between molecular spins and magnons in hybrid heterostructures formed by [CpTi(cot)] and VOPc spin qubits deposited on the surface of the air-stable 2D van der Waals ferromagnet CrSBr using first principles. Our results show that different molecular rotation configurations significantly impact on qubit relaxation time and alter the magnon spectra of the underlying 2D magnet, allowing the chemical coherent control of spin waves in this material. We predict the feasibility of an ultrafast magnon-qubit interface with minimized decoherence, where exchange coupling plays a crucial role. This work opens new avenues for hybrid quantum magnonics, enabling selective tailoring through a versatile chemical approach.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Argüello-Luengo, Alejandro González-Tudela, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Here, we propose a platform based on ultra-cold fermionic molecules trapped in optical lattices to simulate nonadiabatic effects as they appear in certain molecular dynamical problems. The idea consists in a judicious choice of two rotational states as the simulated electronic or nuclear degrees of freedom, in which their dipolar interactions induce the required attractive or repulsive interactions between them. We benchmark our proposal by studying the scattering of an electron or a proton against a hydrogen atom, showing the effect of electronic exchange and inelastic ionization as the mass ratio between the simulated nuclei and electrons (a tunable experimental parameter in our simulator) becomes comparable. These benchmarks illustrate how the simulator can qualitatively emulate phenomena like those appearing in molecular dynamical problems even if the simulated interaction occurs in two-dimensions with a dipolar scaling. Beyond the molecular implementation proposed here, our proposal can be readily extrapolated to other atomic platforms, e.g., based on fermionic Rydberg atoms.</p>

            <h2>Many body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weijun Wu, Saumya Shivam, Amos Chan</p>
            <p>We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry and local TRS - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

            <p>The advancement of polymer informatics has been significantly propelled by the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques, enabling the rapid prediction of polymer properties and expediting the discovery of high-performance polymeric materials. However, the field lacks a standardized workflow that encompasses prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, ML interpretability, and polymer synthesizability. In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density. The POINT$^{2}$ database can serve as a valuable resource for the polymer informatics community for polymer discovery and optimization.</p>

            <h2>DC-driven separation of fractional flux quanta in two-band superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton O. Pokusinkyi, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy</p>
            <p>Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</p>

            <h2>A semiclassical nonequilibrium Green's Function approach to electron transport in systems exhibiting electron-phonon couplings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maicol A. Ochoa</p>
            <p>We formulate a semiclassical theory for electron transport in open quantum systems with electron-phonon interactions adequate for situations when the system's phonon dynamics is comparable with the electron transport timescale. Starting from the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism we obtain equations of motion for the retarded and lesser electronic Green's functions including contributions due to the phonon dynamics up to second order in the electron-phonon coupling strength. The resulting equations assume that the system's phonon follow classical time-local dynamics with delta-correlated noise. We apply our method to the study of the charging/discharging of a periodically driven quantum dot, and a three-level model for a single-electron pump, analyzing the signatures in the transient current, electron population and process performance of the phonon dynamics. For these systems, we consider external harmonic driving of the phonon at frequencies comparable with the electron modulation, and different scenarios, varying electron-phonon coupling strength, coupling to the electron part of the system, and in phase and anti-phase driving. Our results illustrate that our method provides an efficient protocol to describe the effects of nuclear motion in ultrafast transient phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Double commutator method for a two band Bose-Einstein condensate: superfluid density of a flat band superfluid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cai Zhang</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose a double commutator method for a general two-band bosonic superfluid. First and foremost, we prove that the sum of the superfluid and normal densities is equal to the weight of the f-sum rule. This weight can be easily determined by analyzing the ground state wave function. Once we have determined the excitation gap of the upper band, we can calculate the normal density by evaluating the average value of a double commutator between the velocity operator and the Hamiltonian. As an application of this method, we investigate the superfluid density of a flat band Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using the Bogoliubov method, we calculate the sound velocity and excitation gap, which allows us to obtain the normal and superfluid densities explicitly. Our findings indicate that the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the square of the sound velocity and the compressibility. Furthermore, the existence of a non-vanishing superfluid density depends on the form of the interaction. For example, in the case of U(2) invariant interactions, the superfluid density is zero. Additionally, we have observed that for small interactions, the superfluid density is directly proportional to the product of the interaction parameter and the quantum metric. The double commutator method indicates that the correction of the excitation gap by interactions is the origin of the non-vanishing superfluid density of a flat band BEC. Up to the linear order of the interaction parameters, all the results for the excitation gap, the normal and superfluid densities in a flat band BEC can also be obtained through a simple perturbation theory. Our work provides another unique perspective on the superfluid behavior of a flat band BEC.</p>

            <p>Recent proposals for the realization of time-reversal symmetry breaking and topological superconductivity in twisted nodal superconductors have led to a surge of theoretical and experimental studies of these systems, marking one of the newest entries in the rapidly growing field of moiré materials. The interplay between order parameters of the separate layers makes twisted superconductors unique, leading to additional emergent phenomena in regimes usually not of importance in moiré physics, such as bulk interfaces and large twist angles. We review the physics of twisted nodal superconductors, highlighting both similarities and qualitative differences with other moiré platforms. While inspired by the rise of moiré materials, the field is anchored in studies of unconventional superconductivity preceding the moiré era, which we discuss in detail. In addition to summarizing the developments at the present stage, we present a detailed outlook on the major open questions in the field and some of the most exciting future directions.</p>

            <p>The high-entropy concept was applied to the synthesis of transition-metal antimonides, M1-xPtxSb (M = equimolar Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir). High-entropy antimonide samples crystallized in a pseudo-hexagonal NiAs-type crystal structure with a P63/mmc space group were successfully synthesized through a conventional solid-state reaction and subsequent quenching. A detailed investigation of the composition and equilibration conditions confirmed the reversible phase transition between a multi-phase state at low temperature and an entropy-driven single-phase solid solution at high temperatures. Electrical resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements of single-phase M1-xPtxSb (x = 0.2) samples revealed a bulk superconducting transition at 2.15(2) K. This study demonstrates that the high-entropy concept provides numerous opportunities for the discovery of new functional materials such as superconductors.</p>

            <p>We elucidate the transport properties and electronic structures of distorted rutile-type WO2. Electrical resistivity and Hall effect measurements of high-quality single crystals revealed the transport property characteristics of topological materials; these characteristics included an extremely large magnetoresistance of 13,200% (2 K and 9 T) and a very high carrier mobility of 25,700 cm2 V-1 s-1 (5 K). First-principles calculations revealed Dirac nodal lines (DNL) near the Fermi energy in the electronic structure when spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) were absent. Although these DNLs mostly disappeared in the presence of SOIs, band crossings at high-symmetry points in the reciprocal space existed as Dirac points. Furthermore, DNLs protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry persisted on the ky = {\pi}/b plane. The unique transport properties originating from the topological electronic structure of chemically and thermally stable WO2 could represent an opportunity to investigate the potential electronic applications of the material.</p>

            <p>Since Felix Bloch's introduction of the concept of spin waves in 1930, magnons (the quanta of spin waves) have been extensively studied in a range of materials for spintronics, particularly for non-volatile logic-in-memory devices. Controlling magnons in conventional antiferromagnets and harnessing them in practical applications, however, remains a challenge. In this letter, we demonstrate highly efficient magnon transport in an LaFeO$_3$/BiFeO$_3$/LaFeO$_3$ all-antiferromagnetic system which can be controlled electrically, making it highly desirable for energy-efficient computation. Leveraging spin-orbit-driven spin-charge transduction, we demonstrate that this material architecture permits magnon confinement in ultrathin antiferromagnets, enhancing the output voltage generated by magnon transport by several orders of magnitude, which provides a pathway to enable magnetoelectric memory and logic functionalities. Additionally, its non-volatility enables ultralow-power logic-in-memory processing, where magnonic devices can be efficiently reconfigured via electrically controlled magnon spin currents within magnetoelectric channels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Man Shen, Taiki Inoue, Mengyue Wang, Yuanjia Liu, Yoshihiro Kobayashi</p>
            <p>Defects in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) degrade their mechanical,electrical, and thermal properties, limiting their potential applications. To realize the diverse applications of SWCNTs, it is essential to enhance their crystallinity through effective defect healing. However, traditional thermal treatments typically require temperatures above 1800°C, which can alter the nanotube structure. Previously, defect healing of SWCNTs was achieved at a relatively low temperature of 1100°C, using C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ assistance, but the efficiency was limited. In this study, we developed a C$_{2}$H$_{2}$-assisted multiple-cycle process at an even lower temperature of 1000°C combined with air exposure, achieving highly efficient defect healing while preserving the nanotube structure. The combination of multiple-cycle treatment and air exposure between cycles was found to promote defect activation, suppress the formation of amorphous carbon, and enhance the effectiveness of defect healing. Additionally, we successfully healed commercially available bulk-scale SWCNTs (super-growth SWCNTs), noting that their healing behavior differed from lab-grown SWCNTs with smaller diameters synthesized from nanodiamond. The efficient and structure-preserved healing process developed in this study broadens the potential applications of high-quality SWCNTs, including flexible electronics, high-performance composites, and energy storage devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toranosuke Matsubara, Kazuki Yamamoto, Akihisa Koga</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics under continuous measurements for free fermions in a quasiperiodic potential by using the Aubry-André-Harper model with hopping rate $J$ and potential strength $V$. On the basis of the quantum trajectory method, we obtain the phase diagram for the steady-state entanglement entropy and demonstrate that robust logarithmic system-size scaling emerges up to a critical potential strength $V_c/J \sim 2.3$. Moreover, we find that the measurement induces entanglement phase transitions from the logarithmic-law phase to the area-law phase for the potential strength $V< V_c$, while any finite measurement stabilizes the area-law phase for $V>V_c$. This result is distinct from the entanglement scaling in the unitary limit, where volume-law and area-law phases undergo a transition at $V/J=2$. To further support the phase diagram, we analyze the connected correlation function and find that it shows algebraic decay in the logarithmic-law phase, while it decays quickly in the area-law phase. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by introducing quasiperiodic potentials and continuously monitoring the local occupation number with an off-resonant probe light.</p>

We discovered that varying interaction strengths and spin tunneling significantly influence the properties of correlated edge states in the energy spectrum obtained through exact diagonalization. We observe that stronger interactions lead to longer decay lengths of these states. Conversely, the decay length decreases as the difference in intracell or intercell tunneling increases. Importantly, the decay length is strongly correlated with the dynamical behavior of two particles; specifically, an increase in decay length corresponds to a decrease in motion frequency. This conclusion is supported by the observation of the expectation value of coordinate operators of the particles.</p>

            <p>Selective manipulation of particles is crucial in many fields, ranging from chemistry to biology and physics. Dielectrophoresis stands out due to its high selectivity potential and the absence of need for labels. To fully understand and control the phenomenon, observation of the dynamic of nanoparticles under DEP needs to be performed in the three spatial dimensions. However, not many microscopy approaches offer such capability at fast frame rates (>100fps) and high resolution. Here, we used widefield microscopy, to follow the spatiotemporal dynamics of fluorescently labelled polystyrene nanoparticles of 200 nm under positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions. This real-time 3D imaging technique allows for single particle tracking, enabling super-resolved reconstruction of the DEP force and electrokinetic flows with unprecedented detail. We compare the differences for positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions and rationalize these by direct comparison with dynamic modeling results. The framework shown here shows great promise to elucidate the frequency-dependent DEP behavior of nanoparticle, crucial for particle manipulation and sorting.</p>

            <p>Coupled spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum computing and simulations of complex many-body phenomena. However, on the path of scale-up, cross-talk from densely packed electrodes poses a severe challenge. While cross-talk onto the dot potentials is nowadays routinely compensated for, cross-talk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult to tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and implement a way of characterizing and compensating cross-talk on adjacent exchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge. We show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier cross-talk element without knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2x4 quantum dot array. We uncover striking differences among these cross-talk elements which can be linked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate the methodology by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same methodology should be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor platforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is present or can be engineered. Additionally, this procedure is well suited for automated tuning routines as we obtain a stand-out feature that can be easily tracked and directly returns the magnitude of the cross-talk.</p>

            <p>We present a theory of the hydrodynamic forces in the drainage flow of an electrolyte between a sphere and a plane with charged surfaces. Our theory considers a thin electrolyte film which is at all times in local equilibrium across its thickness. In addition to the usual lubrication force, we explicit the electro-kinetic force due to the transport of the diffuse electrical charges as well as the diffusio-kinetic force due to the transport of the excess ion concentration in the Electrostatic Double Layers (EDLs). Our general formalism covers both the case of non-overlapping EDLs and of overlapping EDLs. We study more specifically the mechanical impedance induced by an oscillatory motion of small amplitude of the surfaces. Among our main results, we show that the increase in damping due to the electro-kinetic effect is not monotonic with the surface charge, and we predict a diffusio-kinetic stiffness with a long-range decay in power minus four of the sphere-plane gap susceptible to overcoming the stiffness of the equilibrium Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek force. The comparison of our results with experiments could allow one to confront the theories of electrolyte transport in the Electrostatic Double Layers without adjustable parameters.</p>

Here, we predict two new types of He-bearing compounds, MgHe and MgnHe (n = 6, 8, 10, 15, 18), being formed above 750 GPa by unbiased ab initio structure search. An unexpected bandgap is opened up in MgHe at as low as around 200 GPa. This is the first case of noble gas driven metal-nonmetal transition in all elements. The same mechanism is demonstrated also being applicable to other metallic elements, and making beryllium transform into a non-metallic state, a triumph that is impossible otherwise. Furthermore, the stability of the simple cubic phase of Mg (Mg-sc) is greatly enhanced by mixing with He, which lowers the critical pressure of pure Mg-sc from about 1.1 TPa down to 750 GPa to form ordered substitutional alloying phase of MgnHe on a simple cubic lattice of Mg. This is the first report on Mg-based noble gas substitutional alloy, in sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that He preferring interstitial sites. The observed striking influences of He demonstrate the rich physics and chemistry of He-bearing compounds under ultra-high pressures.</p>

            <h2>Can a ferroelectric diode be a selector-less, universal, non-volatile memory?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumya Sarkar, Xiwen Liu, Deep Jariwala</p>
            <p>Recent advances in silicon foundry-process compatible ferroelectric (FE) thin films have reinvigorated interest in FE-based non-volatile memory (NVM) devices. Ferroelectric diodes (FeDs) are two-terminal NVM devices exhibiting rectifying current-voltage hysteretic characteristics that enable self-selecting designs critical for high-density memory. We examine progress in FeDs based on CMOS-compatible HZO, AlScN, and emerging van der Waals ferroelectrics. While FeDs demonstrate promising ON/OFF ratios and rectification capabilities, they face persistent challenges including limited write-cycling endurance, elevated operating voltages, and insufficient read currents. We provide materials-focused strategies to enhance reliability and performance of FeDs for energy-efficient electronic memory applications, with emphasis on their unique self-rectifying capabilities that eliminate the need for selector elements in crossbar arrays for compute in memory applications.</p>

            <p>Sorbent materials like Cr decorated 2D materials are explored among its storage options. 2D material like graphene has been used as it has a high surface to volume ratio. A comparative study is done with Cr adsorbed in defect-free and single vacancy defect graphene systems. Ab-initio calculations are performed with and without Van der Waals interaction to check the hydrogen storage efficiency. Efficiency is determined by calculating the binding energy of the system. The preferred range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen storage, as determined by the Department of Energy, US, is between 0.2-0.6 eV. This work also visualizes the thermal stability spectrum of the efficient materials at 300 K using molecular dynamics calculations, predicting their stability at room temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen-How Huang, Jon Ortuzar, M. A. Cazalilla</p>
            <p>Chains of triangular nanographene (triangulene), recently identified as realizing the valence-bond solid phase of a spin-$1$ chain, offer a promising platform for quantum information processing. We propose a superconducting spin-singlet qubit based on these chains grown on a superconducting substrate. Using the numerical renormalization group (NRG), we find a manifold of two lowest-lying, isolated spin-singlet states that undergo an avoided crossing. A qubit utilizing these states is thus protected from random-field noise and quasi-particle poisoning. We also introduce a mesoscopic device architecture, based on a triple quantum dot coupled to a superconducting junction, that quantum simulates the spin chain and enables control and readout of the qubit. An effective two-level description of the device is validated using time-dependent NRG.</p>

            <h2>Plasmons in N-layer systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taehun Kim, E. H. Hwang, Hongki Min</p>
            <p>In multilayer structures, the coupling between layers gives rise to unique plasmon modes, but analytic solutions are typically available only for bilayers due to the increasing complexity as the number of layers increases. We investigate plasmons in multilayer structures, including the effects of interlayer tunneling. By introducing the Coulomb eigenvector basis for multilayer systems, which can be solved exactly using Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz matrices, we analytically derive the long-wavelength plasmon dispersions both with and without interlayer tunneling. In the $N$-layer systems, we find that, in the absence of interlayer tunneling, the out-of-phase acoustic or charge neutral plasmon modes with linear dispersions ($\omega_\alpha\propto q/\sqrt{{1-\cos{\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{N}\pi\right)}}}$ for $\alpha = 2, 3, \cdots, N$) exist, while the in-phase classical plasmon mode exhibits its conventional dispersion ($\omega_1\propto \sqrt{q}$). When interlayer tunneling is present, the out-of-phase modes develop plasmon gaps that are governed by specific interband transitions, whereas the classical mode remains unaffected. These findings have broad applicability to general coupled-layer structures.</p>

            <p>FAPbI$_3$ is a material of interest for its potential in solar cell applications, driven by its remarkable optoelectronic properties. However, the low-temperature phase of FAPbI$_3$ remains poorly understood, with open questions surrounding its crystal structure, octahedral tilting, and the arrangement of formamidinium (FA) cations. Using our trained machine-learned potential in combination with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we provide a detailed investigation of this phase, uncovering its structural characteristics and dynamical behavior. Our analysis reveals the octahedral tilt pattern and sheds light on the rotational dynamics of FA cations in the low temperature phase. Strikingly, we find that the FA cations become frozen in a metastable configuration, unable to reach the thermodynamic ground state. By comparing our simulated results with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra, we demonstrate good agreement, further validating our findings. This phenomenon mirrors experimental observations and offers a compelling explanation for the experimental challenges in accessing the true ground state. These findings provide critical insights into the fundamental physics of FAPbI$_3$ and its low-temperature behavior, advancing our understanding of this technologically important material.</p>

            <h2>Deep Nets as Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mike Winer, Boris Hanin</p>
            <p>Neural networks are complex functions of both their inputs and parameters. Much prior work in deep learning theory analyzes the distribution of network outputs at a fixed a set of inputs (e.g. a training dataset) over random initializations of the network parameters. The purpose of this article is to consider the opposite situation: we view a randomly initialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as a Hamiltonian over its inputs. For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors. For some non-linearities, such as $\sin$, for instance, we find that the landscapes of random MLPs exhibit full replica symmetry breaking, while shallow $\tanh$ and ReLU networks or deep shaped MLPs are instead replica symmetric.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Reina-Galvez, Matyas Nachtigall, Nicolas Lorente, Jan Martinek, Christoph Wolf</p>
            <p>Understanding the coherent properties of electron spins driven by electric fields is crucial for their potential application in quantum-coherent nanoscience. In this work, we address two distinct driving mechanisms in electric-field driven electron-spin resonance as implemented in scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We study the origin of the driving field using a single orbital Anderson impurity, connected to polarized leads and biased by a voltage modulated on resonance with a spin transition. By mapping the quantum master equation into a system of equations for the impurity spin, we identify two distinct driving mechanisms. Below the charging thresholds of the impurity, electron spin resonance is dominated by a magnetically exchange-driven mechanism or field-like torque. Conversely, above the charging threshold spin-transfer torque caused by the spin-polarized current through the impurity drives the spin transition. Only the first mechanism enables coherent quantum spin control, while the second one leads to fast decoherence and spin accumulation towards a non-equilibrium steady-state. The electron spin resonance signals and spin dynamics vary significantly depending on which driving mechanism dominates, highlighting the potential for optimizing quantum-coherent control in electrically driven quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingmin Hu, Wen-Yi Zhang, Yunguang Han, Wen-Long You</p>
            <p>Weak ergodicity breaking, particularly through quantum many-body scars (QMBS), has become a significant focus in many-body physics. Krylov state complexity quantifies the spread of quantum states within the Krylov basis and serves as a powerful diagnostic for analyzing nonergodic dynamics. In this work, we study spin-one XXZ magnets and reveal nonergodic behavior tied to QMBS. For the XY model, the nematic Néel state exhibits periodic revivals in Krylov complexity. In the generic XXZ model, we identify spin helix states as weakly ergodicity-breaking states, characterized by low entanglement and nonthermal dynamics. Across different scenarios, the Lanczos coefficients for scarred states display an elliptical pattern, reflecting a hidden SU(2) algebra that enables analytical results for Krylov complexity and fidelity. These findings, which exemplify the rare capability to characterize QMBS analytically, are feasible with current experimental techniques and offer deep insights into the nonergodic dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of model protocells -- flexible quasispherical vesicles -- that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We identify an associated nonequilibrium morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. This transition emerges due to the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving. Further, using insights from stochastic thermodynamics we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law that remains robust even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</p>

            <p>Controlled stacking of van der Waals materials is a powerful tool for exploring the physics of quantum condensed matter. Given the small binding between layers, exploitation for engineering will require a breakthrough in stacking methodology, or an ability to take advantage of thicker defective stacks. Here we describe computational groundwork for the latter, using -- on account of its promise for cold memory applications -- 1$T$-TaS$_2$ as a model system. Comparing recursive Hendricks-Teller calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to published X-ray diffraction data, we obtain the key parameters describing the random stacking in mesoscopic flakes. These then regulate the electronic structures via specification of the random stacks in dynamical mean-field theory simulations. Hubbard repulsion induces strongly correlated metallic, band and Mott insulating layers, providing compelling evidence that electronic properties follow from the coexistence of more than the metallic and insulating planes associated by ordinary band theory.</p>

We study this model with a rate $p$ of magnetic site vacancies through a numerical approach. First, we analyze the effect of few impurities on the ground state, favouring non-coplanar configurations. Second, for finite dilutions, we perform parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations in the $(T,p)$ plane, showing the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the $q=4$ Potts transition. This is a rare example of competing order parameters that exclude each other, whith the chiral one appearing only due to disorder.</p>

            <p>Low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) is a surface science method that works primarily in the UHV environment. It provides information complementary to the other established techniques: it extends the limited view of scanning probe microscopies from nanometers to micrometers and measurement time down to tens of milliseconds, enabling to visualize the changes during sample treatment, e.g., annealing, deposition, and gas or light exposure. From the point of structural analysis, it allows the measurement of diffraction patterns from an area of diameter below 200 nm and imaging of phase distribution on the surfaces either through dark-filed imaging or LEEM-I(V) fingerprinting. The advanced modes provide local angle-resolved photoelectron spectra and surface potential distribution. In this review, we aim to describe the utilization of LEEM to study self-assembled molecular structures on solid surfaces. We present the LEEM instrumentation and analysis of measured data in a tutorial way to provide the necessary background knowledge to enter the field. In the second part, we summarize the knowledge obtained by LEEM for several selected systems, which points to the strength of LEEM in understanding the self-assembled molecular systems and its synergy with other surface science techniques.</p>

            <p>Regulation of topological structures and pattern formation is attracting wide interest in the field of condensed matter. Liquid crystals (LCs) represent soft matter with a remarkable combination of fluidity and anisotropic properties. Topological defects may appear in confined LCs under external stimuli. Recently discovered ferroelectric nematics (NF) opened exceptional opportunities in technologies owing to high permittivity and polarisation. Polar properties of NF supply more variability to topological structures. In this research, we present tunable 2D topological defect arrays in NF compound, induced by an alternating (AC) electric field in simple sandwich cells without pre-patterning. The observed arrays of defects form pseudo-square lattices, which character and periodicity depend on the frequency of the applied field and partially on the cell thickness. The observed effect is explained to occur due to the competition between elastic and electrical forces. The proposed system can be useful to create reconfigurable spatially periodic polarisation structures.</p>

            <p>The strong correlation effect in cuprate superconductors have greatly enriched the phase diagram showing the co-existence of superconductivity with many intertwined orders. One of the prominent issues concerning the superconductivity mechanism is about the pseudogap phase which behaves either as cooperator or competitor for superconductivity and its fundamental reason remains still elusive. Here we report the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) in the model superconducting system Bi2+xSr2-xCuO6+delta with a transition temperature Tc~7 K. Although this system is supposed to be slightly overdoped, a pseudogap feature can be easily observed in the energy region of about 20-60 meV. A modulation of local density of states (LDOS) with a periodicity of about 4a0/3 (a0: Cu-O-Cu bond length) can be easily observed, which is also supported by the Fourier transformation pattern with wavevectors at about (0,+-3pi/2a0) and (+-3pi/2a0,0). Surprisingly, we find that the LDOS exhibits a clear antiphase feature in the pseudogap energy region below and above the Fermi energy, indicating that it is an intrinsic feature of the pseudogap phase. We interpret this modulation and antiphase feature as a possible consequence of the pair density wave due to the Amperean pairing with finite momentum. Our results give a deep insight on the understanding of the pseudogap phase in cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dingyun Yao, Chao Zhang, Z. Y. Xie, Zhijie Fan, Youjin Deng</p>
            <p>The classical Heisenberg model is one of the most fundamental models in statistical and condensed matter physics. Extensive theoretical and numerical studies suggest that, in two dimensions, this model does not exhibit a finite-temperature phase transition but instead manifests asymptotic freedom. However, some research has also proposed the possibility of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition over the years. In this study, we revisit the classical two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model through large-scale simulations with linear system sizes up to $L=16384$. Our Monte-Carlo data, without any extrapolation, clearly reveal an exponential divergence of the correlation length $\xi$ as a function of inverse temperature $\beta$, a hallmark of asymptotic freedom. Moreover, extrapolating $\xi$ to the thermodynamic limit in the low-temperature regime achieves close agreement with the three-loop perturbative calculations. We further propose a finite-size scaling (FSS) ansatz for $\xi$, demonstrating that the pseudo-critical point $\beta_L$ diverges logarithmically with $L$. The thermodynamic and finite-size scaling behaviors of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ are also investigated and corroborate the prediction of asymptotic freedom. Our work provides solid evidence for asymptotic freedom in the 2D Heisenberg model and advances understanding of finite-size scaling in such systems.</p>

Electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility were measured also under high pressure conditions (up to 19 GPa and 9.5 GPa, respectively). Further insight into electronic properties and phonons is provided by ab initio calculations. The results indicate that EuZn$_2$P$_2$ is an antiferromagnet with strong Eu-Eu exchange coupling of ferromagnetic type within the basal plane and weaker antiferromagnetic interaction along the c axis. The Eu magnetic moments are tilted from the basal plane. Hydrostatic pressure strongly affects both magnetic (increase of the Néel temperature) and electronic (suppression of the band gap and semi metallic behavior) properties, indicating a strong interplay of structure with magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Recently there has been considerable excitement surrounding the promising realization of high-spin Kitaev material, such as the quasi-2D compound CrI$_3$ and CrGeTe$_3$. However, the stability of quantum spin liquids (QSL) against single ion anisotropy (SIA) in these materials and the global quantum phase diagram of the extended spin-3/2 Kitaev model with finite SIA remain unclear. In this study, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to explore the quantum phase diagram of the generalized spin-3/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg (K-H) model accompanied with SIA $A_c$. In the $A_c=0$ limit, the spin-3/2 K-H model exhibits a quantum phase diagram similar to that of a spin-1/2 system, including two QSLs around antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic Kitaev models. For models with finite $A_c$, we map out the quantum phase diagram around two Kitaev points and observe distinct types of in-plane vortex orders developed from these two QSL phases. Interestingly, series of nearly degenerate vortex configurations are discovered in each vortex phases. Using linear spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that these vortex configurations can be understood as a consequence of the quantum correction on a continuous family of degenerate classical states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vasco C. Braz, Nuno A. M. Araújo</p>
            <p>When amorphous molecular powders are exposed to high humidity levels or temperatures, the particle viscosity increases due to plasticization, promoting the formation of sinter bridges between pairs of particles in contact. Over time, these bridges facilitate particle agglomeration, eventually leading to the formation of a macroscopic cake that alters the mechanical properties and affects product quality. In this work, we model the caking process of amorphous powders subjected to a temperature shock as a bond percolation problem and investigate how particle bed heterogeneities influence the percolation threshold and, consequently, the expected caking times. Our findings indicate that a slight dispersion in particle size lowers the percolation threshold compared to a monodisperse bed or random percolation in polydisperse systems. Furthermore, we show that the expected caking time exhibits a non-monotonic behavior with the size dispersion, initially decreasing for low dispersion values and increasing for higher values. These results provide insights into the role of the particle size distribution on the caking dynamics of amorphous molecular powders</p>

We generate disordered SHU packings of identical and `nonoverlapping' spheres in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space using a modified collective-coordinate optimization algorithm that incorporates a soft-core repulsive potential between particles in addition to the standard stealthy pair potential. These SHU packings are ultradense, spanning a broad spectrum of structures depending on the stealthiness parameter $\chi$. We consider two-phase media composed of hard particles derived from ultradense SHU packings embedded in a matrix phase, with varying stealthiness parameter $\chi$ and packing fractions $\phi$. Our main objective is the estimation of the dynamical physical properties of such two-phase media, namely, the effective dynamic dielectric constant and the time-dependent diffusion spreadability, which is directly related to nuclear magnetic relaxation in fluid-saturated porous media. We show through spreadability that two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit faster interphase diffusion due to the higher packing fractions achievable compared to media obtained without soft-core repulsion. The imaginary part of the effective dynamic dielectric constant of SHU packings vanishes at a small wavenumber, implying perfect transparency for the corresponding wavevectors. We also obtain cross-property relations between transparency characteristics and long-time behavior of the spreadability for such two-phase media. Our results demonstrate that disordered two-phase media derived from ultradense SHU packings exhibit advantageous transport and optical behaviors of both theoretical and experimental significance.</p>

            <h2>Synergy of Doob Transformation and Montroll Defect Theory for Random Walks in External Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stanislav Burov</p>
            <p>We present a systematic method for constructing stochastic processes by modifying simpler, analytically solvable random walks on discrete lattices. Our framework integrates the Doob $h$-transformation with the Montroll defect theory, overcoming the strict constraints associated with each method alone. By combining these two approaches, we map random walks in simple potentials onto processes involving more general external potentials and metastable states. Explicit analytical expressions relate the transformed process to the original one, facilitating direct investigation of exponential decay rates and additional dynamical modes. As an illustrative example, we demonstrate our method by analyzing a random walker in a linear potential modified to include a metastable state, revealing distinct exponential decay regimes relevant to escape dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Multiscale Insights of Domain Unfolding in Fibrin Mechanical Response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Sharma, Poulomi Sadhukhan</p>
            <p>Fibrinogen, the monomeric unit of fibrin, the main constituent of blood clot, has a very complex structure. The fibrinogen builds the fibrin fiber and network through the half-staggered packing via knob-hole interaction and the $\alpha$C crosslinkers. Due to its rich structure, the elastic behavior also shows a unique nature of very high stretchability and multiple regimes in stress-strain behaviour, which is not yet fully understood. We develop an Unfolding-incorporated Coarse-Grained Polymer (UCGP) model for fibrinogen to study the effect of domain unfolding on the mechanical behavior of fibrin fiber and network. Our model captures the stretching behavior of fibrinogen as observed in AFM and all-atom simulations. We further extend our model to fibrin fiber to study the effect of molecular unfolding at the fiber and network level. We anticipate that our model will be able to account for the nonlinear mechanical behavior of crosslinked fibrin gel. It is possibly the first model of this sort to consider the precise, controllable knowledge of the effects of domain unfolding in crosslinked proteins. This model can also be used to model systems that have sacrificial bonds.</p>

            <p>Europium-based materials are highly attractive due to their diverse range of physical properties. In these studies, we aimed to synthesize single crystals of the potentially topological semimetallic compound EuAgP, which up to this day has only been obtained in polycrystalline form. The flux method was employed for the syntheses, using fluxes such as: Bi, Sn, Pb, and In, in their various ratios. The purpose of using Bi flux was to try synthesizing an analog of EuAgAs single crystals, by fully substituting arsenic with phosphorus. The obtained crystals were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Despite many unsuccessful attempts to synthesize EuAgP single crystals, the study provides valuable insights into how different fluxes and their ratios influence the final synthesis product. It also underscores the complexity of designing analogs between arsenides and phosphides.</p>

            <p>This article reviews recent advances in low-temperature electronic thermal transport properties of thermally biased superconductor heterostructures focusing on the two-terminal transport. Since the last decade, ferromagnetism has been widely used to enhance the thermoelectricity in heterostructures based on ordinary superconductors. The possibility of getting giant thermoelectric effects with optimum thermal conductance by breaking the electron-hole symmetry of the ordinary superconductor boosted the research in this direction. Recently, attention has been paid to the role of triplet Cooper pairs that emerged in ferromagnetic junctions and the possibility of advanced applications. Other forms of magnetism, specifically antiferromagnetism and altermagnetism, have been investigated to unravel the behavior of the thermal and charge current in thermally biased junctions. In parallel to ordinary superconductors, junctions with unconventional superconductors have been explored for the same purpose. Thermal transport in superconducting bilayers has been studied using advanced materials like Dirac and topological materials, including Weyl semimetals. Significant attention has been paid to thermally biased topological Josephson junctions to explore the phase-tunable current in recent times. Weyl Josephson junctions, multi-terminal Josephson junctions, and various other multilayer junctions have also been studied to engineer large thermoelectric effects and various functionalities with potential applications in superconductor-based thermal device components.</p>

            <h2>Local basis for interacting topological bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishchhal Verma, Raquel Queiroz</p>
            <p>The discovery of correlated states in moire materials has challenged the established methods of projecting interactions into a local Wannier basis due to topological obstructions that manifest in extended interactions. This difficulty can sometimes be evaded by decomposing the band into a basis of extended itinerant states and a lattice of local states, using the heavy fermion prescription. We revisit this framework by systematically identifying the dominant interaction channels guided by the eigenvalues of the projected density operator. This approach can be applied both to tight-binding and continuum models, allowing us to identify a hierarchy in interaction scales that can be universally used to reduce the Hilbert space dimension and determine an appropriate local basis for modeling electronic correlations in interacting topological materials.</p>

            <p>The recursion method provides a powerful framework for studying quantum many-body dynamics in the Lanczos basis, which is recursively constructed within the Krylov space of operators. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the recursion method, when supplemented by the universal operator growth hypothesis, can effectively compute autocorrelation functions and transport coefficients at infinite temperature. In this work, we extend the scope of the recursion method to far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. We apply the method to spin systems in one, two, and three spatial dimensions. In one dimension we find a clear evidence that the convergence of the method is limited in time by the dynamical quantum phase transition.</p>

            <p>Amorphous metal-organic frameworks are an important emerging materials class that combine the attractive physical properties of the amorphous state with the versatility of metal-organic framework (MOF) chemistry. The structures of amorphous MOFs have largely been inferred by drawing analogies to crystalline polymorphs and inorganic glasses, but ultimately the validity of such structural models has been challenging to establish either experimentally or computationally. Here we use a unified data-driven approach, combining experimental scattering data and active machine learning for interatomic potentials, to determine the structure of an amorphous zeolitic imidazolate framework (a-ZIF) -- the canonical amorphous MOF. Our results reveal clear differences between the structure of a-ZIF and that of other amorphous tetrahedral networks, allowing us to invalidate the long-standing assumption that these inorganic and hybrid glasses are topologically equivalent. To this end, we introduce a systematic notation for the network topology of amorphous solids, building a bridge to the successful use of topology analysis in crystalline MOFs and to materials informatics. Our work provides insights into the structure and topology of the archetypal amorphous MOF and opens up new avenues for modelling and understanding amorphous framework materials more generally.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu</p>
            <p>The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, %with or without mobility edges, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the (emergent) chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criteria for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a novel generalization of the quasiperiodic hopping zeros in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models derived from the spinful system hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. In particular, we reach a single model that hosts all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</p>

            <p>The innate tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a primary manifestation of quantum statistics. This tendency can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering if the atoms scatter into already occupied quantum states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering is simply given by the bosonic-stimulation factor $1 + N_{\rm f}$, where $N_{\rm f}$ is the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, have a dramatic effect on the atom-light scattering. Due to (spatially local) beyond-mean-field atomic correlations, weak repulsive interactions can completely suppress the bosonic enhancement of scattering, while attractive ones increase the scattering rate. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the momentum-space population dynamics. Its extreme sensitivity to dynamical beyond-mean-field effects makes off-resonant light scattering a simple and powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</p>

            <h2>Intertwining bulk and surface: the case of UTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Szabo, Aline Ramires</p>
            <p>UTe$_2$ has been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies in recent years, as it is recognized as an odd-parity bulk superconductor. Its surface has also been probed, revealing charge density wave (CDW), pair density wave (PDW), and time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB). In this work, we propose that the interplay between the order parameters observed on the surface and in the bulk of UTe$_2$ may be crucial in explaining some of the unusual features detected by surface probes in this material. Through a phenomenological analysis, we can account for three distinctive experimental signatures observed on the surface of UTe$_2$: i) the apparent suppression of CDW order at the upper critical field of the bulk superconducting state; ii) the magnetic field-induced imbalance of the Fourier peaks associated with the CDW; iii) the onset of TRSB at the bulk superconducting critical temperature and its field-trainability. Furthermore, we propose specific experimental checks to validate our conjecture, which we believe could be promptly achieved.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Peters, Philippe Talatchian</p>
            <p>Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a supervised learning algorithm that trains network parameters using local neuronal activity. This is in stark contrast to backpropagation, where updating the parameters of the network requires significant data shuffling. Avoiding data movement makes EP particularly compelling as a learning framework for energy-efficient training on neuromorphic systems. In this work, we assess the ability of EP to learn on hardware that contain physical uncertainties. This is particularly important for researchers concerned with hardware implementations of self-learning systems that utilize EP. Our results demonstrate that deep, multi-layer neural network architectures can be trained successfully using EP in the presence of finite uncertainties, up to a critical limit. This limit is independent of the training dataset, and can be scaled through sampling the network according to the central limit theorem. Additionally, we demonstrate improved model convergence and performance for finite levels of uncertainty on the MNIST, KMNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Optimal performance is found for networks trained with uncertainties close to the critical limit. Our research supports future work to build self-learning hardware in situ with EP.</p>

            <p>We introduce the concept of "ajar systems" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Osborne, Ciro Salcedo, Andrew A. Houck</p>
            <p>Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</p>

            <p>Twin photons and triple photons generations require pump laser intensities of several hundred Mega Watts per square centimeter. Micrometer sized crystalline waveguides allow such interactions to be achieved at relatively low energies by taking advantage of the confinement of light. The materials selected to achieve these phenomena in the present work are from the titanyl phosphate family. The chosen architecture is a micrometric layer of KTA grown on a KTP substrate forming a planar waveguide in a first step. These two isostructural materials have a low lattice parameter mismatch, making it possible to achieve high quality epitaxial growth. The refractive index of KTA being higher than that of KTP, this couple of materials could allow light to be guided in the deposited layer. To grow the KTA film, the chosen technique is pulsed laser deposition (PLD) that allows nonlinear complex oxides layer of optical quality to be grown. In this study, we show that the growth is well oriented for layers with a thickness up to 200 nm after deposition. Then, after annealing, the crystal state is improved as well as the surface. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of KTA epitaxy over KTP by PLD with good epitaxial quality, good orientation and theoretical phase-matching conditions for a planar KTA waveguide.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yagya Woli, Bryson Krause, Thang Hoang</p>
            <p>Random lasing occurs as the result of coherent optical feedback from random scattering centers. Plasmonic nanostructures, such as silver or gold nanoparticles, efficiently scatter light due to the formation of hot spots and optical confinement at the nanoscale. In this work, using silver nanocubes as highly efficient light scattering centers, a broad band plasmon assisted lasing action of halide perovskite materials is demonstrated. By embedding silver nanocubes in CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 solutions, narrow bandwidth lasing modes with a full width at half-maximum of approximately 1 nm are supported. It is observed that the lasing thresholds of perovskites are different for glass and gold substrates, and for different nanocube concentrations. Results of time-resolved measurements indicate a significant shortening in the decay time of the emission at above the lasing threshold, implying a stimulated emission process. The results of this work thus provide a pathway to generate coherent light sources from widely studied perovskite materials.</p>

To broaden access, we demonstrate an SEM using simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf components, and hobby-level electromechanics; this has been enabled by a unique thermionic electron source based on a carbon nanotube array excited by low optical power. The instrument offers sub-micrometer resolution, a depth of focus of several hundred micrometers, and an image quality comparable to commercial SEMs; it also tolerates poor vacuum and moist specimens, making it broadly applicable. It has a flexible design that lends itself to easy customization for different use scenarios.

            <p>Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.</p>

            <p>Extensive optical measurements of canonical turbulent pipe flows have revealed the existence of structural boundary states (SBSs) -- near-wall low-speed streaks strongly correlated with pairs of counter-rotating quasi-streamwise vortices. In this study, we investigate the number fluctuations of these structures within the framework of statistical mechanics. Specifically, we introduce reduced degrees of freedom to model the low-speed streaks as a dilute lattice gas of hard-core particles. The Metropolis stochastic evolution provides, furthermore, a simple yet effective two-parameter model for describing SBS transitions. The lattice gas approach enables us to derive both the probability of SBS occurrence and the peculiar self-similar correlations that these structures exhibit along the streamwise direction. Our findings give additional support to the idea that the statistically stationary regimes of wall-bounded turbulent flows can be understood as Markov chains of coherent dynamical states in reduced-dimensional phase spaces.</p>

Additionally, for waves described by vector fields, local rotation of the wavefield produces spin AM (or simply, spin). These dynamical wave properties become particularly significant in structured (i.e., inhomogeneous) wavefields. Here we provide an introduction and overview of the momentum and AM properties for a variety of classical waves: electromagnetic, sound, elastic, plasma waves, and water surface waves. A unified field-theory approach, based on Noether's theorem, offers a general framework to describe these diverse physical systems, encompassing longitudinal, transverse, and mixed waves with different dispersion characteristics. We also discuss observable manifestations of the wave momentum and AM providing clear physical interpretations of the derived quantities.</p>

Our approach employs a delay mechanism to represent the cell cycle, allowing the use of arbitrary distributions for cell cycle lengths.

Notably, our model successfully replicates experimentally observed synchronization phenomena that multi-stage models could not adequately explain. By using a gamma distribution to model cell cycle lengths, we achieved excellent agreement between our simulations and empirical data, while significantly reducing computational complexity and parameter estimation challenges inherent in multi-stage approaches. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating cell cycle lengths in modeling cell populations, with potential implications for optimizing cell cycle-dependent tumor therapies.</p>

            <p>Optical-based nanothermometry represents a transformative approach for precise temperature measurements at the nanoscale, which finds versatile applications across biology, medicine, and electronics. The assembly of ratiometric fluorescent 40 nm nanoparticles designed to serve as individual nanothermometers is introduced here. These nanoparticles exhibit unprecedented sensitivity (11% /K) and temperature resolution 128 \, \mathrm{K} \cdot \mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2} \cdot \mathrm{W} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2}, outperforming existing optical nanothermometers by factors of 2-6 and 455, respectively. The enhanced performance is attributed to the encapsulation of fluorescent molecules with high density inside the mesoporous matrix. It becomes possible after incorporating hydrophobic groups into the silica matrix, which effectively prevents water ingress and dye leaking. A practical application of these nanothermometers is demonstrated using confocal microscopy, showcasing their ability to map temperature distributions accurately. This methodology is compatible with any fluorescent microscope capable of recording dual fluorescent channels in any transparent medium or on a sample surface.

            <p>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens is a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybean, worldwide used as biofertilizer. This soil bacterium possesses two flagellar systems enabling it to swim in water-saturated soils. However, the motility in soil pores, which may be crucial for competitiveness for root nodulation, is difficult to predict. To address this gap, we fabricated microfluidic devices with networks of connected microchannels surrounding grains. In them, we directly visualise bacterial behaviour in transparent geometries mimicking minimalist soils-on-a-chip (SOCs). We measured the population velocities and changes of direction for two strains: the wild-type and a mutant with only a subpolar flagellum. A detailed statistical analysis revealed that both strains exhibited reduced speeds and increased changes of direction of 180$^\circ$, in channels of decreasing cross sectional area, down to a few microns in width. Interestingly, while the wild-type strain displayed faster swimming in unconfined spaces, this advantage was negated in the SOCs with the narrowest microchannels. We employed the measured motility parameters to propose a realistic model and simulate B. diazoefficiens confined dynamics being able to reproduce their behaviour, which additionally can be extended enabling further predictions for long time and macro scales. This multidisciplinary work, combining design, microfabrication, microbiology and modelling, offers useful methods to study soil bacteria and may be readily extended to other beneficial/harmful soil species.</p>

            <h2>Meta-Ori: monolithic meta-origami for nonlinear inflatable soft actuators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo de Souza Oliveira, Xin Li, Johannes Frey, Edoardo Milana</p>
            <p>The nonlinear mechanical response of soft materials and slender structures is purposefully harnessed to program functions by design in soft robotic actuators, such as sequencing, amplified response, fast energy release, etc. However, typical designs of nonlinear actuators - e.g. balloons, inverted membranes, springs - have limited design parameters space and complex fabrication processes, hindering the achievement of more elaborated functions. Mechanical metamaterials, on the other hand, have very large design parameter spaces, which allow fine-tuning of nonlinear behaviours. In this work, we present a novel approach to fabricate nonlinear inflatables based on metamaterials and origami (Meta-Ori) as monolithic parts that can be fully 3D printed via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) commercial filaments. Our design consists of a metamaterial shell with cylindrical topology and nonlinear mechanical response combined with a Kresling origami inflatable acting as a pneumatic transmitter. We develop and release a design tool in the visual programming language Grasshopper to interactively design our Meta-Ori. We characterize the mechanical response of the metashell and the origami, and the nonlinear pressure-volume curve of the Meta-Ori inflatable and, lastly, we demonstrate the actuation sequencing of a bi-segment monolithic Meta-Ori soft actuator.</p>

            <p>The technological transition from soft machines to soft robots necessarily passes through the integration of soft electronics and sensors. This allows for the establishment of feedback control systems while preserving the softness of the robot embodiment. Multistable mechanical metamaterials are excellent building blocks of soft machines, as their nonlinear response can be tuned by design to accomplish several functions. In this work, we present the integration of soft capacitive sensors in a multistable mechanical metamaterial, to enable proprioceptive sensing of state changes. The metamaterial is a periodic arrangement of 4 bistable unit cells. Each unit cell has an integrated capacitive sensor. Both the metastructure and the sensors are made of soft materials (TPU) and are 3D printed. Our preliminary results show that the capacitance variation of the sensors can be linked to state transitions of the metamaterial, by capturing the nonlinear deformation.</p>

            <p>Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, the demonstrated structures are relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the previously unknown coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of top-down nanofabrication techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anahita Mobaseri, Satish Kumar, Xiang Cheng</p>
            <p>The maximum spreading of an impacting liquid drop is a key metric for characterizing the fundamental fluid process of drop impact. While extensively studied for Newtonian liquids, how far a non-Newtonian drop can spread upon impacting a solid substrate remains an open question. Here, by combining simulations, experiments, and scaling analyses, we establish a general framework for predicting the maximum spreading of drops of generalized Newtonian liquids, encompassing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors. Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we identify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation during drop impact. The finding allows us to map the spreading of non-Newtonian drops onto that of Newtonian drops, revealing the quantitative dependence of the maximum spreading diameter on various impact parameters and rheological properties of liquids. Our study addresses the long-standing challenge of understanding the impact dynamics of non-Newtonian drops, and provides valuable guidance for designing non-Newtonian liquids to achieve desired impact outcomes.</p>

The second approach relies, in particular, on the so-called Nicolai map. The relation between the two approaches hasn't been clarified and the subject of this contribution is to spell it out.

            <p>Polarization-encoded spin-photon interfaces constitute promising candidates for the development of stationary nodes used as photon receivers, for quantum communication and distributed quantum computing. Here we introduce a time-resolved tomography approach which allows observing the dynamics of an electron spin, in a semiconductor quantum dot, mapped onto the dynamics of the polarization state of reflected photons. Through a single tomography experiment, we infer all the relevant spin dynamics timescales, including precession, decoherence and relaxation times. We also demonstrate and quantify the measurement back-action induced, on the embedded spin qubit, by the detection of a single reflected photon. We show that the induced population and coherence of the spin state can be tuned by the chosen polarization basis of the measurement. The control of the photon-induced back-action on the embedded spin qubit constitutes a crucial requirement for the use of spin-photon interfaces as quantum receivers.</p>

            <p>The Haldane model is the simplest yet most powerful topological lattice model exhibiting various phases, including the Dirac semimetal phase and the anomalous quantum Hall phase (also known as the Chern insulator). Although considered unlikely to be physically directly realizable in condensed matter systems, it has been experimentally demonstrated in other physical settings such as cold atoms, where Hermiticity is usually preserved. Extending this model to the non-Hermitian regime with energy non-conservation can significantly enrich topological phases that lack Hermitian counterparts; however, such exploration remains experimentally challenging due to the lack of suitable physical platforms. Here, based on electric circuits, we report the experimental realization of a genuine non-Hermitian Haldane model with asymmetric next-nearest-neighbor hopping. We observe two previously uncovered phases: a non-Hermitian Chern insulator and a non-Hermitian semimetal phase, both exhibiting boundary-dependent amplifying or dissipative chiral edge states. Our work paves the way for exploring non-Hermiticity-induced unconventional topological phases in the Haldane model.</p>

            <h2>Acceleration Theorem for Low-Dimensional Electron Systems with Off-Diagonal Effective Mass Components</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobuya Mori, Hajime Tanaka, Jo Okada</p>
            <p>The motion of electrons under homogeneously applied electric fields in low-dimensional systems with non-zero off-diagonal effective mass (ODEM) is studied. The equation describing the time evolution of a probability coefficient of finding an electron in a subband is derived using the Krieger-Iafrate theory in the effective mass approximation. It is shown that an electron can change subbands during free flight due to the ODEM-induced inter-subband transitions. By introducing an effective dispersion defined as a weighted average of the subband dispersions, it is also shown that the initial acceleration of an electron effectively follows the bulk dispersion relation. The results obtained suggest that the transport properties of the quantized systems when many subbands are occupied in the weak confinement limit approach the values one would find without considering the quantization.</p>

            <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in scientific research. Yet their computational cost often limits the timescales and system sizes that can be explored. Most data-driven efforts have been focused on reducing the computational cost of accurate interatomic forces required for solving the equations of motion. Despite their success, however, these machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are still bound to small time-steps. In this work, we introduce TrajCast, a transferable and data-efficient framework based on autoregressive equivariant message passing networks that directly updates atomic positions and velocities lifting the constraints imposed by traditional numerical integration. We benchmark our framework across various systems, including a small molecule, crystalline material, and bulk liquid, demonstrating excellent agreement with reference MD simulations for structural, dynamical, and energetic properties. Depending on the system, TrajCast allows for forecast intervals up to $30\times$ larger than traditional MD time-steps, generating over 15 ns of trajectory data per day for a solid with more than 4,000 atoms. By enabling efficient large-scale simulations over extended timescales, TrajCast can accelerate materials discovery and explore physical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional simulations and experiments.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingyu Yang, Chantal Hareau, Jack Gartside, Mathieu Mivelle</p>
            <p>Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.</p>

            <h2>Feature learning from non-Gaussian inputs: the case of Independent Component Analysis in high dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabiola Ricci, Lorenzo Bardone, Sebastian Goldt</p>
            <p>Deep neural networks learn structured features from complex, non-Gaussian inputs, but the mechanisms behind this process remain poorly understood. Our work is motivated by the observation that the first-layer filters learnt by deep convolutional neural networks from natural images resemble those learnt by independent component analysis (ICA), a simple unsupervised method that seeks the most non-Gaussian projections of its inputs. This similarity suggests that ICA provides a simple, yet principled model for studying feature learning. Here, we leverage this connection to investigate the interplay between data structure and optimisation in feature learning for the most popular ICA algorithm, FastICA, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is used to train deep networks. We rigorously establish that FastICA requires at least $n\gtrsim d^4$ samples to recover a single non-Gaussian direction from $d$-dimensional inputs on a simple synthetic data model. We show that vanilla online SGD outperforms FastICA, and prove that the optimal sample complexity $n \gtrsim d^2$ can be reached by smoothing the loss, albeit in a data-dependent way. We finally demonstrate the existence of a search phase for FastICA on ImageNet, and discuss how the strong non-Gaussianity of said images compensates for the poor sample complexity of FastICA.</p>

            <p>The direct bonding process of a diamond-on-insulator (DOI) substrate enables monolithic integration of diamond photonic structures for quantum computing by improving photon collection efficiency and entanglement generation rate between emitters. It also addresses key fabrication challenges, such as robustness, bonding strength, and scalability. In this study, we investigate strain effects in DOI substrates following direct bonding. Strain generation is expected near the diamond-SiO2/Si interface due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the bonded materials. Strain-induced lattice distortions are characterized using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond via optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. PL mapping reveals interference fringes in unbonded regions, indicating bonding irregularities. Depth-resolved ODMR measurements show a volumetric strain component increase of ~0.45 MHz and a shear component increase of ~0.71 MHz between the top surface and the DOI interface. However, ODMR signal contrast and peak linewidth remain largely unaffected, suggesting no visible deterioration in the optical properties of the emitters. By combining ODMR and PL mapping, this work establishes a robust methodology for assessing bonding quality and strain impact on NV centers, an essential step toward advancing scalable quantum technologies and integrated photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG, can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible 0-1 solutions. This study proposes a post-processing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the proposed post-processing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with significantly reduced computation time.</p>

            <p>Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data post-processing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>The non-Hermitian transverse XY model with Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Wohlman-Aharony (KSEA) interaction having RT-symmetry, referred to as iKSEA model, possesses both an exceptional point at which eigenvectors coalesce and a quantum critical point where gap-closing occurs. To precisely estimate the magnetic field of the system, we prove that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the ground state of the iKSEA model, which is a lower bound of the precision quantified by the root mean square error, scales as $N^2$, with N being the system-size. This provides Heisenberg scaling both at the quantum critical point and the exceptional point in the thermodynamic limit. It indicates that when the system is in contact with the bath, resulting in this non-Hermitian model, reservoir engineering can provide enhanced precision of system parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate analytically that, in contrast to Hermitian systems, QFI surpasses the Heisenberg limit and achieves super-Heisenberg scaling ($\sim N^6$), when the strength of the KSEA interaction approaches the anisotropy parameter, permitting competition between non-hermiticity and hermiticity features, as long as the system size is moderate.</p>

            <p>We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th Rényi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.</p>

As found in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we resolve two intra-$t_{2g}$ excitations in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$. Moreover, the lowest lying excitation in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ shows a significant dispersion, revealing a collective character differently from what is observed in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Theoretical modelling supports the interpretation of this lowest energy excitation in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a magnetic transverse mode with multi-particle character, whereas the corresponding excitation in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ is assigned to combined longitudinal and transverse spin modes. These fundamental differences are discussed in terms of the inequivalent magnetic ground-state manifestations in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <h2>Scaling in Kinetics of Supercooled Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Zhang, D. M. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong</p>
            <p>The present study introduces a renormalization based approach to investigate the relaxation dynamics within supercooled liquids. By applying a numerical scale transformation to potential energies along the temporal axis, we have established a novel framework that elucidates the underlying kinetics of supercooled liquids. Our findings indicate that the skewness of the potential energy distribution attains its maximum at a characteristic time scale, D, which exhibits a Curie like scaling relationship with temperature. This scaling relationship is characterized by an exponent, g, that experiences a discontinuous transition at a critical cooling rate, signifying a kinetic like phase this http URL further demonstrate that g maintains an approximate scaling relationship with the cooling rate, where the product of g and the logarithm of the cooling rate is approximately this http URL constant, however, varies depending on whether the cooling rate is above or below the critical value, effectively classifying supercooled liquids into two distinct categories: the glass transition as the destiny of supercooled liquid, GDL, and the crystallization as the destiny of supercooled liquid, CDL. Furthermore, we identify that Ts corresponds to the glass transition temperature for GDL and the crystallization temperature for CDL, respectively. We have successfully developed a theoretical model,which not only derives the Curie like power law but also provides profound insights into the physical implications of D, g and Ts. This research delineates the differences between GDL and CDL, and offers a fresh perspective for exploring the nature of glasses. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the mechanisms of glass formation.</p>

            <h2>Resolving the Corbino Shockley-Ramo Paradox for Hydrodynamic Current Noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Hui</p>
            <p>Johnson noise thermometry enables direct measurement of the electron temperature, a valuable probe of many-body systems. Practical use of this technique calls for non-equilibrium generalizations of the Johnson-Nyquist theorem. For a hydrodynamic Corbino device, however, a naïve use of the Shockley-Ramo theorem alongside the "Corbino paradox" leads to yet another paradox: bulk velocity fluctuations cannot be measured by the contacts. In this work, we resolve the unphysical "Corbino Shockley-Ramo paradox" by correctly formulating the hydrodynamic Shockley-Ramo problem. This allows us to properly formulate the problem of current noise in an hydrodynamic multi-terminal device of arbitrary geometry, as well as validate a previously unjustified assumption for rectangular geometry results. As an example, we compute the Johnson noise in a hydrodynamic Corbino device, where we find a suppression of Johnson noise with magnetic field. This unusual characteristic serves as a strong signature of viscous hydrodynamic behavior.</p>

            <h2>Solute Co-Segregation Mechanisms at Low-Angle Grain Boundaries in Magnesium: A Combined Atomic-Scale Experimental and Modeling Study</h2>

            <p>Solute segregation at low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) critically affects the microstructure and mechanical properties of magnesium (Mg) alloys. In modern alloys containing multiple substitutional elements, understanding solute-solute interactions at microstructural defects becomes essential for alloy design. This study investigates the co-segregation mechanisms of calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), and aluminum (Al) at a LAGB in a dilute AZX010 Mg alloy by combining atomic-scale experimental and modeling techniques. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography (3D-APT) revealed significant segregation of Ca, Zn, and Al at the LAGB, with Ca forming linear segregation patterns along dislocation arrays characteristic of the LAGB. Clustering analysis showed increased Ca-Ca pairs at the boundary, indicating synergistic solute interactions. Atomistic simulations and elastic dipole calculations demonstrated that larger Ca atoms prefer tensile regions around dislocations, while smaller Zn and Al atoms favor compressive areas. These simulations also found that Ca-Ca co-segregation near dislocation cores is energetically more favorable than other solute pairings, explaining the enhanced Ca clustering observed experimentally. Thermodynamic modeling incorporating calculated segregation energies and solute-solute interactions accurately predicted solute concentrations at the LAGB, aligning with experimental data. The findings emphasize the importance of solute interactions at dislocation cores in Mg alloys, offering insights for improving mechanical performance through targeted alloying and grain boundary engineering.</p>

            <h2>Gauged cooling of topological excitations and emergent fermions on quantum simulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilad Kishony, Mark S. Rudner, Achim Rosch, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>Simulated cooling is a robust method for preparing low-energy states of many-body Hamiltonians on near-term quantum simulators. In such schemes, a subset of the simulator's spins (or qubits) are treated as a ``bath,'' which extracts energy and entropy from the system of interest. However, such protocols are inefficient when applied to systems whose excitations are highly non-local in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom, such as topological phases of matter; such excitations are difficult to extract by a local coupling to a bath. We explore a route to overcome this obstacle by encoding of the microscopic degrees of freedom into those of the quantum simulator in a non-local manner. To illustrate the approach, we show how to efficiently cool the ferromagnetic phase of the quantum Ising model, whose excitations are domain walls, via a ``gauged cooling'' protocol in which the Ising spins are coupled to a $Z_2$ gauge field that simultaneously acts as a reservoir for removing excitations. We show that our protocol can prepare the ground states of the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases equally efficiently. The gauged cooling protocol naturally extends to (interacting) fermionic systems, where it is equivalent to cooling by coupling to a fermionic bath via single-fermion hopping.</p>

            <h2>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jochem G. Meijer, Vincent Bertin, Detlef Lohse</p>
            <p>Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a good agreement between mean dwell times measured in 50~nm diameter, perpendicularly magnetized superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJ), and theoretical predictions based on Langer's theory. Due to a large entropic contribution, the theory yields Arrhenius prefactors in the femtosecond range for the measured junctions, in stark contrast to the typically assumed value of 1~ns. Thanks to the low prefactors, and fine-tuning of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, we report measured mean dwell times as low as 2.7~ns under an in-plane applied field at negligible bias voltage. Under a perpendicular applied field, we predict a Meyer-Neldel compensation phenomenon, whereby the prefactor scales like an exponential of the activation energy, in line with the exponential dependence of the measured dwell time on the field. We further predict the occurrence of (sub)nanosecond dwell times as a function of effective anisotropy and junction diameter at zero bias voltage. These findings pave the way towards the development of ultrafast, low-power, unconventional computing schemes operating by leveraging thermal noise in perpendicular SMTJs, which can be scaled down below 20~nm.</p>

            <p>Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of a given outcome out of competitive events. This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler's ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out of equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to $d$-dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path towards the study of competitive events in complex media.</p>

The equilibrium separation is about 50 A, which demands large-scale atomistic simulations - inaccessible for density functional theory but attainable with BOP. We performed atomistic simulations of these separated dislocations with BOP and predicted that they reside in degenerate core structures.

            <h2>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mauricio J. del Razo, Margarita Kostré</p>
            <p>Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</p>

            <p>Bilayers, soft substrates coated with stiff films, are commonly found in nature with examples including skin tissue, vesicles, and organ membranes. They exhibit different types of instabilities when subjected to compression, depending on the contrast in material properties between the two components. In this work, we unravel the mechanisms behind wrinkling instabilities in auxetic bilayer systems under uniaxial tension. We find that a soft bilayer in tension can experience significant lateral contraction, and with sufficient contrast in Poisson ratios, compressive stresses may induce wrinkles aligned with the tensile direction. We analytically model the onset of wrinkles and validate our predictions using Finite Element simulations in ABAQUS. Our findings reveal that wrinkles occur when the Poisson ratio of the substrate is greater than that of the film. As the two Poisson ratios converge to a common value, the critical stretch for instability shoots up rapidly and the wrinkles disappear. We also confirm these results through asymptotic analysis. Using inverse analysis, we design film microstructures to achieve desired effective Poisson ratios and further validate the effective properties with the Finite Element code FEAP. We show that the critical stretch ratio for buckling in auxetic structures with microstructural patterns is in strong agreement with the homogenized model predictions. The proposed method has significant potential for controlling surface patterns in auxetic skin grafts and hydrogel organ patches under mechanical loads. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions for compressible bilayers developed in this work can also be applied under finite strain for buckling-based metrology.</p>

            <p>In a multiply hydrogenated polymer of phenalenyl tessellation molecules (PTMs), spatially overlapping zero modes appear, and three spin-aligned electron spins per PTM are generated through direct exchange interactions in the strongly correlated electron system. This interaction was used to design a two-dimensional (2D) $S = 3/2$ Heisenberg spin system on a honeycomb lattice. Simulations of the electronic structure using density functional theory with the Wannierization method revealed an array of nonbonding molecular orbitals (zero modes) in the hydrogenated nanographene structure. Our analysis of the onsite interaction strength indicated that each zero mode was half-filled with a spin-active electron owing to electron correlation effects. The low-energy subspace of the resulting zero mode-tight-binding model suggests the formation of a 2D antiferromagnetic $S = 3/2$ Heisenberg system with an entangled quantum spin ground state.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the motion of a domain wall in type-II superconductors driven by inhomogeneities of temperature or spin density. The model consists of the time-dependent GinzburgLandau equation and the thermal/spin diffusion equation whose transport coefficients (the thermal/spin conductivity and the spin relaxation time) depend on the order parameter, interpolating the values for the superconducting and the normal states. Numerical and analytical calculations show that the domain wall moves toward the higher temperature/spin-density region where the order parameter is suppressed. We can understand the motions of the domain walls as dynamical processes reducing the loss of condensation energy. We also analyze the driving force, the viscous force, the thermal force, and the force due to the spin accumulation gradient, on the basis of the momentum balance relations.</p>

            <p>In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction, Energy Windows Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW), we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Kohn Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the linearization energy of the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed, to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the linearization energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW).</p>

            <h2>A Graph Random Walk Method for Calculating Time-of-Flight Charge Mobility in Organic Semiconductors from Multiscale Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongquan Chen, Pim van der Hoorn, Björn Baumeier</p>
            <p>We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. Our approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in terms of a sparse, linear system, avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional Master Equation or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.</p>

It exhibits magnetosonic waves which, unlike in $d=3$, are isotropic, to which there is a contribution from the odd viscosity coefficient present in the system. Further, we find a dynamo action, which unlike in $d=3$ requires compressibility of the flow.</p>

            <p>Ranking nodes in networks according to a defined measure of importance is an extensively studied task, with applications in ecology, economic trade networks, and social networks. This paper introduces a method based on a non-linear iterative map to evaluate node relevance in bipartite networks. By tuning a single parameter $\gamma$, the method captures different concepts of node importance, including established measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and the fitness-complexity ranking. The algorithm's flexibility allows for efficient ranking optimization tailored to specific tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. We apply this method to ecological mutualistic networks, where ranking quality can be assessed by the extinction area - the rate at which the system collapses when species are removed in a certain order. The map with the optimal $\gamma$ value surpasses existing ranking methods on this task. Additionally, our method excels in evaluating nestedness, another crucial structural property of ecological systems, requiring specific node rankings. Finally, we explore theoretical aspects of the map, revealing a phase transition at a critical $\gamma$ dependent on the data structure that can be characterized analytically for random networks. Near the critical point, the map exhibits unique features and a distinctive "triangular" packing pattern of the incidence matrix.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional semiconducting moiré materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Recently, tMoTe2 has attracted significant attentions due to the observation of the long-sought fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the tMoTe2 moiré superlattice remains elusive. Here, we report STM/STS studies in dual-gated tMoTe2 moiré devices with twist angles ranging from 2.3 to 3.8 deg. The device consists of two independent back-gates, one enables an ohmic contact for tMoTe2, while the other fine-tunes the Fermi level of tMoTe2. This dual-gate control enables direct measurement of the electronic structure in tMoTe2 under varied displacement fields and moiré filling factors, by fine tuning the gate voltage and the tip bias. Our STS spectra and spatial imaging reveal that the low-energy moiré flat bands are predominantly localized in the XM and MX regions of the moiré superlattice. At zero E-field, these bands form a honeycomb lattice with non-trivial topology, whereas an applied E-field drives a transition into two distinct triangular lattices with trivial topology. The spatial distributions align with large-scale first-principle calculations, demonstrating that the topological flat bands arise from the K-valley hybridization between the top and bottom MoTe2 layers. Furthermore, we show that the effective moiré potential depth can be controlled via gate and tip biases. At sufficient potential depths, we observe the emergence of Wigner molecular crystals, transitioning MX triangular lattice into a Kagome lattice at MX moiré filling factor 3. These results elucidate the microscopic origin of topological flat bands in tMoTe2 and demonstrate electric-field control of topology and correlated electronic orders, paving the way to engineer exotic quantum phases in moiré simulators.</p>

            <p>The application of variational principles for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is fixed and the other end is free, have received less attention in terms of their stability despite their prevalence. In this article, we establish stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional through the generalized Jacobi condition. This requires computing conjugate points determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to an end load. The rod deformations are modelled using Kirchhoff rod theory. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. The numerical examples highlight its dependence on the system parameters. These examples illustrate potential applications in the design of flexible soft robot arms and innovative mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Grain boundary (GB) segregation in magnesium (Mg) substantially influences its mechanical properties and performance. Atomic-scale modelling, typically using ab-initio or semi-empirical approaches, has mainly focused on GB segregation at highly symmetric GBs in Mg alloys, often failing to capture the diversity of local atomic environments and segregation energies, resulting in inaccurate structure-property predictions. This study employs atomistic simulations and machine learning models to systematically investigate the segregation behavior of common solute elements in polycrystalline Mg at both 0 K and finite temperatures. The machine learning models accurately predict segregation thermodynamics by incorporating energetic and structural descriptors. We found that segregation energy and vibrational free energy follow skew-normal distributions, with hydrostatic stress, an indicator of excess free volume, emerging as an important factor influencing segregation tendency. The local atomic environment's flexibility, quantified by flexibility volume, is also crucial in predicting GB segregation. Comparing the grain boundary solute concentrations calculated via the Langmuir-McLean isotherm with experimental data, we identified a pronounced segregation tendency for Nd, highlighting its potential for GB engineering in Mg alloys. This work demonstrates the powerful synergy of atomistic simulations and machine learning, paving the way for designing advanced lightweight Mg alloys with tailored properties.</p>

In addition to topological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provides a fingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a method to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in artificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states. We determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains, topological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding simulations.</p>

            <h2>Persistent homology elucidates hierarchical structures responsible for mechanical properties in covalent amorphous solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emi Minamitani, Takenobu Nakamura, Ippei Obayashi, Hideyuki Mizuno</p>
            <p>Understanding how atomic-level structures govern the mechanical properties of amorphous materials remains a fundamental challenge in solid-state physics. Under mechanical loading, amorphous materials exhibit simple affine and spatially inhomogeneous nonaffine displacements that contribute to the elastic modulus through the Born (affine) and nonaffine terms, respectively. The differences between soft local structures characterized by small Born terms or large nonaffine displacements have yet to be elucidated. This challenge is particularly complex in covalent amorphous materials such as silicon, where the medium-range order (MRO) plays a crucial role in the network structure. To address these issues, we combined molecular dynamics simulations with persistent homology analysis. Our results reveal that local structures with small Born terms are governed by short-range characteristics, whereas those with large nonaffine displacements exhibit hierarchical structures in which short-range disorder is embedded within the MRO. These hierarchical structures are also strongly correlated with low-energy localized vibrational excitations. Our findings demonstrate that the mechanical responses and dynamic properties of covalent amorphous materials are intrinsically linked to the MRO, providing a new framework for understanding and tailoring their properties.</p>

            <h2>Visualizing the internal structure of the charge-density-wave state in CeSbTe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinglu Que, Qingyu He, Lihui Zhou, Shiming Lei, Leslie Schoop, Dennis Huang, Hidenori Takagi</p>
            <p>The collective reorganization of electrons into a charge density wave has long served as a textbook example of an ordered phase in condensed matter physics. Two-dimensional square lattices with $p$ electrons are well-suited to the realization of charge density waves, due to the anisotropy of the $p$ orbitals and the resulting one dimensionality of the electronic structure. In spite of a long history of study of charge density waves in square-lattice systems, few reports have recognized the significance of a hidden orbital degree of freedom. The degeneracy of $p_x$ and $p_y$ electrons may give rise to orbital patterns in real space that endow the charge density wave with additional broken symmetries or unusual order parameters. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the internal structure of the charge-density-wave state of CeSbTe, which contains Sb square lattices with 5$p$ electrons. We image atomic-sized, anisotropic lobes of charge density with periodically modulating anisotropy, which we interpret in terms of a superposition of $p_x$ and $p_y$ bond density waves. Our results support the fact that delocalized $p$ orbitals can reorganize into emergent electronic states of matter.</p>

            <h2>Strongly hybridized phonons in one-dimensional van der Waals crystals</h2>

            <p>The phenomena of pronounced electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in one-dimensional (1D) systems are ubiquitous, which are well described by frameworks of Luttinger liquid, Peierls instability and concomitant charge density wave. However, the experimental observation of strongly hybridized phonons in 1D was not demonstrated. Herein we report the first observation of strongly hybridized phonons in 1D condensed matters by using double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), representative 1D van der Waals crystals, with combining the spectroscopic and microscopic tools as well as the ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We observe uncharted phonon modes in one commensurate and three incommensurate DWNT crystals, three of which concurrently exhibit strongly-reconstructed electronic band structures. Our DFT calculations for the experimentally observed commensurate DWNT (7,7) @ (12,12) reveal that this new phonon mode originates from a (nearly) degenerate coupling between two transverse acoustic modes (ZA modes) of constituent inner and outer nanotubes having approximately trigonal and pentagonal rotational symmetry along the nanotube circumferences. Such coupling strongly hybridizes the two phonon modes in different shells and leads to the formation of a unique lattice motion featuring evenly distributed vibrational amplitudes over inner and outer nanotubes, distinct from any known phonon modes in 1D systems. All four DWNTs that exhibit the pronounced new phonon modes show small chiral angle twists, closely matched diameter ratios of 3/5 and decreased frequencies of new phonon modes with increased diameters, all supporting the uncovered coupling mechanism. Our discovery of strongly hybridized phonons in DWNTs open new opportunities for engineering phonons and exploring novel phonon-related phenomena in 1D condensed matters.</p>

            <h2>Cahn-Hilliard model with Schlögl Reactions: interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. II. Memory effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. O. Mchedlov-Petrosyan, L. N. Davydov</p>
            <p>The present work is a continuation of our previous paper [Condens. Matter Phys., 2020, 23, 33602: 1-17]. It is devoted to the modelling of the interplay of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions. The modelling of equilibrium phase transition is based on the modified Cahn-Hilliard equation. The non-equilibrium phase transition is modeled by the Second Schlögl reaction system. We consider the advancing front, which combines these both transitions. Different from the first article, we consider here the memory effects, i.e., the effects of non-Fickian diffusion. The traveling wave solution is obtained, and its dependence on the model parameters is studied in detail. The relative importance of memory effects for different process regimes is estimated.</p>

            <p>The high-resolution visualization of atomic structures is significant for understanding the relationship between the microscopic configurations and macroscopic properties of materials. However, a rapid, accurate, and robust approach to automatically resolve complex patterns in atomic-resolution microscopy remains difficult to implement. Here, we present a Trident strategy-enhanced disentangled representation learning method (a generative model), which utilizes a few unlabelled experimental images with abundant low-cost simulated images to generate a large corpus of annotated simulation data that closely resembles experimental results, producing a high-quality large-volume training dataset. A structural inference model is then trained via a residual neural network which can directly deduce the interlayer slip and rotation of diversified and complicated stacking patterns at van der Waals interfaces with picometer-scale accuracy across various materials (e.g. MoS2, WS2, ReS2, ReSe2, and 1T'-MoTe2) with different layer numbers , demonstrating robustness to defects, imaging quality, and surface contaminations. The framework can also identify pattern transition interfaces, quantify subtle motif variations, and discriminate moire patterns that are difficult to distinguish in frequency domains. Finally, the high-throughput processing ability of our method provides insights into a van der Waals epitaxy mode where various thermodynamically favorable slip stackings can coexist.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on transition probabilities of small-scale quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Tesser, Matteo Acciai, Christian Spånslätt, Inès Safi, Janine Splettstoesser</p>
            <p>We study the transition probabilities of a two-point measurement on a quantum system, initially prepared in a thermal state. We find two independent constraints on the difference between transition probabilities when the system is prepared at different temperatures, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the measured quantum system is small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to increase or to reduce the temperature of the system. The derived constraints apply to arbitrary system Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. We show the relevance of these constraints for the special case where transitions are induced by energy or particle exchange in weakly coupled bipartite systems out of equilibrium. This example is of interest for a wide range of experimentally relevant systems, from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</p>

            <h2>Efficiently preparing chiral states via fermionic cooling on bosonic quantum hardware</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilad Kishony, Mark S. Rudner, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>Simulating many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of near-term quantum computers. An important open question is how to efficiently prepare the ground states of arbitrary fermionic Hamiltonians, especially those with nontrivial topology. Here, we propose an efficient protocol for preparing low-energy states of fermionic Hamiltonians on a noisy bosonic quantum simulator by adiabatic cooling using a simulated bath. We arrange the couplings such that the simulated system and bath together obtain a local fermionic description in which fermionic excitations can be extracted individually, via coherent hopping to the bath, rather than in pairs as would otherwise be required by fermion parity conservation. This approach thus achieves a linear (rather than quadratic) scaling of the cooling rate vs. excitation density at low densities. We show that certain topological phases such as the chiral (non-Abelian) phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be prepared efficiently using our protocol. Our protocol performs favorably in the presence of noise, making it suitable for execution on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The thermoelectric characteristics of lead selenium (PbSe) doped with gallium (Ga) are investigated in this study. When the lead sulfide (PbSe) is tuned with appropriate dopants, it exhibits satisfactory ZT values, hence making it a promising thermoelectric material. This study examines the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and power factor of PbSe, with varying amounts of added Ga. Results indicate that incorporating Ga into PbSe improves its thermoelectric performance, with a maximum ZT value of approximately 1.2 at 873 K for the optimal doping concentration of 0.005 atomic percent. This improvement is attributed to the combined effects of increased electrical conductivity and reduced thermal conductivity. These findings suggest that Ga-doped PbSe is a promising candidate for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.</p>

            <h2>Role of magnetic doping in topological HgTe and application of the Gram-Schmidt method for computing impurity states in quantum wells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawid Bugajewski, Tomasz Dietl</p>
            <p>The quantum spin Hall effect in non-magnetic and Mn-doped HgTe quantum well is strongly affected by Kondo scattering of edge electrons by holes localized on acceptors. A generalized eigenvalue method is usually employed for determining impurity binding energies from the multiband Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonians in bulk samples and semiconductor quantum structures. Such an approach provides accurate values of the level positions but its applicability for determining the impurity localization radius can be questioned. As an alternative method we propose here the Gram-Schmidt ortogonalization procedure allowing to employ the standard eigenvalue algorithms and, thus, to determine both impurity level energies and the set of normalized eigenvectors. We apply this approach to singly-ionized acceptor states in HgTe quantum wells and obtain impurity level energies and localization radiuses even for states degenerate with the continuum of band states. Such information allows us to assess the energy of bound magnetic polarons in quantum wells doped with magnetic ions. We determine the polaron energies and discuss consequences of the resonant polaron formation on band transport in the bulk samples and quantum wells in the regimes of quantum Hall effects.</p>

            <p>Verification and validation of methods and first-principles software are at the core of computational solid-state physics but are too rarely addressed. We compare four first-principles codes: Abinit, Quantum ESPRESSO, EPW, ZG, and three methods: (i) the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), (ii) the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory using Wannier function perturbation theory (WFPT), and (iii) an adiabatic non-perturbative frozen-phonon method. For these cases, we compute the real and imaginary parts of the electron-phonon self-energy in diamond and BAs, including dipoles and quadrupoles when interpolating. We find excellent agreement between software that implements the same formalism as well as good agreement between the DFPT and WFPT methods. Importantly, we find that the Deybe-Waller term is momentum dependent which impacts the mass enhancement, yielding approximate results when using the Luttinger approximations. Finally, we compare the electron-phonon spectral functions between Abinit and EPW and find excellent agreement even away from the band edges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilad Kishony, Ori Grossman, Netanel Lindner, Mark Rudner, Erez Berg</p>
            <p>We consider two-dimensional periodically driven systems of fermions with particle-hole symmetry. Such systems support non-trivial topological phases, including ones that cannot be realized in equilibrium. We show that a space-time defect in the driving Hamiltonian, dubbed a ``time vortex,'' can bind $\pi$ Majorana modes. A time vortex is a point in space around which the phase lag of the Hamiltonian changes by a multiple of $2\pi$. We demonstrate this behavior on a periodically driven version of Kitaev's honeycomb spin model, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes and time vortices can realize any combination of $0$ and $\pi$ Majorana modes. We show that a time vortex can be created using Clifford gates, simplifying its realization in near-term quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>The layered honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has emerged as a promising candidate for realizing a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. Previous studies have reported oscillation-like anomalies in the longitudinal thermal conductivity and half-integer quantized thermal Hall conductivity above the antiferromagnetic critical field $H_c$, generating significant interest. However, the origins of these phenomena remain contentious due to strong sample dependence. Here we re-examine the magnetothermal transport properties using recently available ultra-pure $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ single crystals to further elucidate potential signatures of the spin liquid state. Our findings reveal that while anomalies in thermal conductivity above $H_c$ persist even in ultraclean crystals, their magnitude is significantly attenuated, contrary to the quantum oscillations hypothesis. This suggests that the anomalies are likely attributable to localized stacking faults inadvertently introduced during magnetothermal transport measurements. The thermal Hall conductivity exhibits a half-quantized plateau, albeit with a narrower width than previously reported. This width reduction can be understood through two distinct mechanisms: sample-dependent magnetic critical fields that influence the lower boundary of the plateau region, and the decoupling between chiral Majorana edge currents and phononic thermal transport that determines the upper boundary. These results indicate that structural imperfections exert a substantial influence on both the oscillation-like anomalies and quantization effects observed in magnetothermal transport measurements of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.</p>

            <p>We report the redox switching of ferrocene moieties embedded in a double tunnel barrier plasmonic cavity fabricated from a click-chemistry self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenyl-alkylthiol on ultra flat gold surfaces, connected to a single poly(vinylpyrrolidone) capped silver nanocube, AgNC, which is contacted by the tip of a conductive-AFM to study the electron transport properties in the dark and under light irradiation at the plasmonic resonance wavelengths. We observe a dual behavior in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in the dark: a large hysteresis loop at positive voltages and an hysteretic negative differential conductance (NDC) at negative voltages, due to the redox switching of ferrocene between its oxidized (Fc+) and neutral (Fc0) states. The I-V curves are analyzed by a generalized combined Marcus-Landauer model. We determine the highest occupied molecular orbital of the Fc+ and Fc0 states at 0.54 and 0.42 eV below the Fermi energy, respectively, with a weak reorganization energy < 0.1 eV upon switching. Under plasmonic excitation, the hysteresis and NDC behaviors are no longer observed and the I-V characteristics of the Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol/AgNC junctions become similar to Au-ferrocenyl-alkylthiol SAMs. A virtual molecular orbital due to the plasmon-induced coupling (fast electron transfer) between the two redox states of the Fc is determined at 0.46 eV. This dynamic behavior opens perspectives in artificial synaptic devices for neuromorphic computing with the additional function to turn on/off this synaptic behavior on-demand by light.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Carta, Iurii Timrov, Peter Mlkvik, Alexander Hampel, Claude Ederer</p>
            <p>Several methods have been developed to improve the predictions of density functional theory (DFT) in the case of strongly correlated electron systems. Out of these approaches, DFT+$U$, which corresponds to a static treatment of the local interaction, and DFT combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), which considers local fluctuations, have both proven incredibly valuable in tackling the description of materials with strong local electron-electron interactions. While it is in principle known that the Hartree-Fock (HF) limit of the DFT+DMFT approach should recover DFT+$U$, demonstrating this equivalence in practice is challenging, due to the very different ways in which the two approaches are generally implemented. In this work, we introduce a way to perform DFT+$U$ calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO using Wannier functions as calculated by Wannier90, which allows us to use the same Hubbard projector functions both in DFT+$U$ and in DFT+DMFT. We benchmark these DFT+$U$ calculations against DFT+DMFT calculations where the DMFT impurity problem is solved within the HF approximation. Considering a number of prototypical materials including NiO, MnO, LaMnO$_3$, and LuNiO$_3$, we establish the sameness of the two approaches. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our approach by going beyond the commonly used atomic orbital-like projectors by performing DFT+$U$ calculations for VO$_2$ using a special set of bond-centered Wannier functions.</p>

            <p>Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ thin films, significant research has focused on Zr-doped HfO$_2$ and solid solution (Hf,Zr)O$_2$ thin films. Functional properties can be further tuned via multilayering, however, this approach has not yet been fully explored in HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ films. This work demonstrates ferroelectricity in a 50 nm thick, solution-processed HfO$_2$-ZrO$_2$ multilayer film, marking it as the thickest multilayer film to date exhibiting ferroelectric properties. The multilayer structure was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, with high-resolution TEM revealing grain continuity across multiple layers. This finding indicates that a polar phase in the originally paraelectric ZrO$_2$ layer, can be stabilized by the HfO$_2$ layer. The film attains a remanent polarization of 9 uC/cm$^2$ and exhibits accelerated wake-up behavior, attributed to its higher breakdown strength resulting from the incorporation of multiple interfaces. These results offer a faster wake-up mechanism for thick ferroelectric hafnia films.</p>

A metastable defect phase diagram based on the chemical potential of Al was constructed to map site occupancy preferences, where Ta$_4$Fe$_6$Al$_2$ and Ta$_4$Fe$_2$Al$_6$ exhibit the widest chemical potential windows. The correlation between lattice distortions and site occupancy was examined, demonstrating that symmetric Al distributions enhance structural preference.

            <p>Research on high-temperature superconductors has primarily focused on hydrogen-rich compounds, however, the need for extreme pressures limits their practical applications. The X2MH6-type structure Mg2IrH6 stands out because it exhibits superconductivity at 160 K under ambient pressure. This study investigates methods to increase the superconducting transition temperature of this structure via atomic substitution and low-pressure treatment and assess the mechanical, thermodynamic, and dynamic stability of structures obtained by substituting Mg and Ir atoms in Mg2IrH6 with elements from the same groups using first-principles calculations. The findings identify 11 stable ternary compounds, 10 of which exhibit superconducting transition temperatures, with three compounds, Mg2CoH6, Mg2RhH6, and Mg2IrH6, exceeding 100 K, classifying them as high-temperature superconductors. Their superconducting figure of merit S values are 2.71, 3.35, and 3.83, respectively, suggesting strong practical application potential. The analysis results indicate that mid-frequency hydrogen phonons significantly enhance superconducting properties via electron-phonon coupling. The band structure study highlights the importance of van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. In addition, electron localization function and Fermi surface topology analyses reveal that the Fermi surface shape and density of states are crucial for increasing superconducting transition temperatures.</p>

            <p>We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultrastrong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhances the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing the cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in the antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and impose a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade for quantum information technology in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.</p>

At higher orders, standard implementations become numerically costly, but a significant speed-up can be achieved by evaluating multidimensional integrals in an approximate factorized form. Here we develop a one-crossing approximation solver based on the recently introduced quantics tensor cross interpolation, and demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency with applications to the Anderson impurity model and nonequilibrium steady-state DMFT calculations for the Hubbard model.</p>

            <p>We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (< 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering</p>

            <p>Recent developments in spintronics have drawn renewed attention to the spin dynamics of cubic ferromagnetic crystals EuO and EuS. These ferromagnets have the simplest possible magnetic structure, making them the most suitable systems for testing various theoretical models of magnetic materials. A commonly used Weiss mean-field approximation (MFA) provides only a qualitative description of the magnetization temperature dependence $M(T)$. We develop a consistent theory for $M(T)$ based on the perturbation diagrammatic technique for spin operators. Our theory is in excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental dependence of $M(T)$ for EuO and EuS throughout the entire temperature range from $T=0$ to Curie temperature $T_{C}$. In particular, our theoretical dependence $M(T)$ demonstrates a scaling behavior $M(T)\propto (T_{C}-T)^{\beta_*}$ with the scaling index $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ in a wide range of temperatures in agreement with the experimentally observed apparent scaling in EuO and EuS. The scaling behavior with $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ is manifested in the temperature range $T\lesssim T_{C}$ where corrections to the magnetization due to its fluctuations $\delta M (T)\lesssim M(T)$. To distinguish it from the narrow ``critical" range $T\approx T_{C}$ with $\delta M (T) > M(T)$, we term this $T$-range ``precritical". The precritical corrections $\delta M (T)$ are still large enough to affect the $M(T)$ behavior. The index $\beta_*$ fundamentally differs from the ``normal" scaling index $\beta_{MFA}=1/2$ predicted by the MFA, which neglects the magnetization fluctuations. We refer to the emerging in our theory apparent magnetization scaling with $\beta_*\approx 1/3$ as ``precritical anomalous".</p>

            <h2>Coarsening dynamics of Ising-nematic order in a frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Yang, Yi-Hsuan Liu, Rafael M. Fernandes, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
            <p>We study the phase ordering dynamics of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ (nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings) Heisenberg model on the square lattice in the strong frustration regime ($J_2/J_1 > 1/2$). While thermal fluctuations preclude any long-range magnetic order at finite temperatures, the system exhibits a long-range spin-driven nematic phase at low temperatures. The transition into the nematic phase is further shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class based on the critical exponents near the phase transition. Our large-scale stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations find a two-stage phase ordering when the system is quenched from a high-temperature paramagnetic state into the nematic phase. In the early stage, collinear alignments of spins lead to a locally saturated Ising-nematic order. Once domains of well-defined Ising order are developed, the late-stage relaxation is dominated by curvature-driven domain coarsening, as described by the Allen-Cahn equation. The characteristic size of Ising-nematic domains scales as the square root of time, similar to the kinetic Ising model described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our results confirm that the late-stage ordering kinetics of the spin-driven nematic, which is a vestigial order of the frustrated Heisenberg model, belongs to the dynamical universality class of a non-conserved Ising order. Interestingly, the system shows no violation of the superuniversality hypothesis under weak bond disorder. The dynamic scaling invariance is preserved in the presence of weak bond disorder. We also discuss possible applications of our results to materials for which vestigial Ising-nematic order is realized.</p>

            <h2>Non-invertible SPTs: an on-site realization of (1+1)d anomaly-free fusion category symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenqi Meng, Xinping Yang, Tian Lan, Zhengcheng Gu</p>
            <p>We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Induced Activation of Symmetry-Forbidden Exciton-Phonon Couplings for Enhanced Phonon-Assisted Photoluminescence in MoS$_2$ Monolayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rishabh Saraswat, Rekha Verma, Sitangshu Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>Phonon-assisted photoluminescence (PL) in molybdenum-based two-dimensional dichalcogenides is typically weak due to the dormant phonon coupling with optically inactive momentum-dark (intervalley) excitons, unlike in tungsten-based dichalcogenides where such processes are more prominent. Despite this inefficiency, we revisit excitons in MoS$_2$ using rigorous finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations to identify ways to enhance phonon-assisted recombination channels. Our ab-initio results, complemented by group-theoretic analyses, reveal that while unstrained MoS$_2$ exhibits no phonon-assisted PL emissions at cryogenic temperatures due to forbidden A$^{\prime\prime}$ phonon modes, biaxial strain opens a pathway to significantly intensify this emission by activating hole-phonon A$^{\prime}$-mediated scattering channels. By calculating allowed exciton-phonon matrix elements and scattering rates, we demonstrate how strain redistributes oscillator strengths toward radiative recombination. These findings provide a promising route to improving PL emission efficiency in various metal dichalcogenide monolayers through strain engineering and offer valuable insights for further exploration of exciton-phonon dynamics, including time-resolved spectroscopic studies.</p>

            <h2>Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Al. Osipov, Boris Fainberg</p>
            <p>A dynamic approach based on the multiconfiguration Haqrtree method to description of exciton self-trapping is proposed. Primarily motivated by the phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high excitation concentrations we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. In particular, based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steady-state solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The bi-self-trapped exciton in the mirror-symmetric configuration can be described by the Dicke Hamiltonian and is responsible for superfluorescence. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi Luo, Yu-Ge Chen, Ye-Min Zhan, Yue Yu</p>
            <p>Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples from the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conduction electrons instead of the monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conduction electron with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order from the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we find here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Tang, Konstantinos Sfairopoulos, Wanzhou Zhang, Chengxiang Ding</p>
            <p>Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu (BW) model under linear quenches. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density after exiting the impulse regime does not follow from a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening dynamics; the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form with an exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we show that, if the system starts from its ground state, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with an exponential decay of the excess defect density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the defect density exhibits a good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism.</p>

            <p>The continuous displacive phase transition in SrTiO$_3$ near $T_c \approx 105$ K features a central elastic peak in neutron scattering investigations at temperatures above $T_c$, i.e., before the corresponding soft phonon mode is overdamped upon cooling. The origin of this central peak is still not understood. Here, we report an inelastic x-ray scattering investigation of the cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in SrTiO$_3$. We compare quantitatively measurements of the soft phonon mode on two differently grown samples and discuss the findings regarding results from thermodynamic and transport probes such as specific heat and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to perform elastic scans with both high momentum- and milli-electronvolt energy-resolution and, thus, be able to separate elastic intensities of the central peak from low-energy quasielastic phonon scattering. Our results indicate that the evolution of the soft mode is similar in both samples though the intensities of the central peak differ by a factor of four. Measurements revealing anisotropic correlation lengths on cooling towards $T_c$, indicate that local properties of the crystals to which collective lattice excitations are insensitive are likely at the origin of the central elastic line in SrTiO$_3$.</p>

            <h2>$Δ$-model correction of Foundation Model based on the models own understanding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Bjørk Hammer</p>
            <p>Foundation models of interatomic potentials, so called universal potentials, may require fine-tuning or residual corrections when applied to specific subclasses of materials. In the present work, we demonstrate how such augmentation can be accomplished via $\Delta$-learning based on the representation already embedded in the universal potentials. The $\Delta$-model introduced is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model and various types of aggregation (global, species-separated, and atomic) of the representation vector are discussed. Employing a specific universal potential, CHGNet [Deng et al., Nat. Mach. Intell. 5, 1031 (2023)], in a global structure optimization setting, we find that it correctly describes the energetics of the "8" Cu oxide, which is an ultra-thin oxide film on Cu(111). The universal potential model even predicts a more favorable structure compared to that discussed in recent DFT-based literature. Moving to sulfur adatom overlayers on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) the CHGNet model, however, requires corrections. We demonstrate that these are efficiently provided via the GPR-based $\Delta$-model formulated on the CHGNet's own internal atomic embedding representation. The need for corrections is tracked to the scarcity of metal-sulfur atomic environments in the materials project database that CHGNet is trained on leading to an overreliance on sulfur-sulfur atomic environments. Other universal potentials trained on the same data, MACE-MP0, SevenNet-0, and ORB-v2-only-MPtrj show similar behavior, but with varying degrees of error, demonstrating the general need for augmentation schemes for universal potential models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pankaj Popli, Ananyo Maitra, Sriram Ramaswamy</p>
            <p>We present a detailed analytical and numerical examination, on square and triangular lattices, of the non-reciprocal planar spin model introduced in Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020). We show that the effect of lattice anisotropy should persist at large scales, leading to a ``mass'' for the angle field of the spins, and behaviour not in the ``Malthusian Toner-Tu'' universality class. Numerically, we find evidence of this mass at large values of our non-reciprocity parameter; for smaller values, we find power-law scaling of long-wavelength equal-time correlators in the polar-ordered phase of our lattice model over the system sizes and wavenumber range explored. Focussing on topological defects, we show numerically that defect interactions are highly anisotropic with respect to the mean ordering direction. In particular, the constituents of a $\pm 1$ pair are shielded from each other in a class of configurations, deferring their annihilation and allowing time for the nucleation of further defects. The result, we show numerically, is the destruction of the polarised phase via an aster apocalypse reminiscent of that found by Besse et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 268003 (2022), for the Malthusian Toner-Tu equation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahil N. Valani, David M. Paganin</p>
            <p>Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. We numerically investigate the dynamics of several WPEs and find that they self-organize into a bound cluster, akin to a nucleus. This active cluster exhibits various modes of collective excitations as the memory of the system is increased. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective potential indicating an analogy with the bag model of a nucleus. At high memory, the active cluster can destabilize and eject WPEs whose decay statistics follow exponential laws analogous to radioactive nuclear decay. Hydrodynamic nuclear analogs open up new directions to pursue, both experimentally and numerically, within the nascent field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs.</p>

These systems exhibit bound charge and momentum densities at lattice and magnetic defects, and currents induced by electric or time-varying strain fields. Our work extends the classification of topological matter by uncovering novel symmetry-protected topological phases with quantized responses.</p>

In multiferroics with three order parameters (polarization, magnetization, and toroidization), such response turns out to be also proportional to the trilinear coupling between the order parameters. Here we explore this scenario, discussing the effects of such trilinear coupling within a Landau theory framework, and using ab initio calculations to discuss a specific model system for this effect, namely the recently predicted three-order-parameter multiferroic metal Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin Hall effect is usually realized in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry, but whether it can be realized without symmetry protection remains unexplored. Here, we propose type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with quantized spin Hall conductivity, whose edge states with opposite chirality and polarization, distributed in different Brillouin zone regions, connect the conduction and valence bands at the boundary. Thus, the type-II quantum spin Hall insulator does not require any symmetry protection other than translational symmetry. Then, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that type-II quantum spin Hall insulator can be realized in both altermagnetic materials and Luttinger compensated magnetic materials. Furthermore, based on lattice model, we find that as long as $U(1)$ symmetry exists, type-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase can always exist stably. However, if $U(1)$ symmetry is broken, type-II quantum spin Hall insulator phase transforms into an obstructed atomic insulator phase as spin-orbit coupling effect is enhanced. Therefore, our work not only proposes a new mechanism for realizing the quantum spin Hall effect, but also enriches the types of unconventional magnetic topological phases.</p>

The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</p>

For "Malthusian" flocks, in which birth and death cause the density to relax quickly, thereby eliminating density as a hydrodynamic variable, we are able to obtain two exact scaling laws relating the three scaling exponents characterizing the long-distance properties of these systems. We also show that it is highly plausible that such flocks display long-range order in two dimensions. In addition, we demonstrate that for "immortal" flocks, in which the number of flockers is conserved, the extra non-linearities allowed by the presence of an extra slow variable (number density) make it impossible to obtain any exact scaling relations between the exponents. We thereby demonstrate that several past published claims of exact exponents for Malthusian and immortal flocks are all incorrect.</p>

            <p>Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiang Yang, Yayun Hu, Zhe Hou, Peiqing Tong</p>
            <p>Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) are a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.</p>

The predicted single-crystal elastic constants (${C}_{ij}$) show that the title compound is mechanically stable. At the same time, it turns out to be dynamically stable where all the calculated phonon frequencies have positive values. The cohesive energy was calculated to verify the energy stability of the material considered. We also determined the variations of some macroscopic physical parameters as functions of temperature, namely the thermal expansion coefficient, the lattice thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we investigated the temperature dependencies of some thermoelectric coefficients such as electronic thermal conductivity, and figure of merit. Such encouraging results indicate that the compound is a potential candidate for thermoelectric devices.</p>

In particular, the results of calculations indicate qualitative and even quantitative universality in the behavior of the mentioned lattice systems of different geometry and dimensionality at the same values of a certain reduced temperature when that behavior is expressed in terms of some dimensionless parameters. An additional possibility to describe the order-disorder phase transitions in some other lattice systems (e.g., antiferromagnets and alloys) is also discussed in the paper.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Cruz Sanchez, V. Trejos Montoya, O. Pizio</p>
            <p>We report the temperature, pressure and composition dependence of some basic properties of model liquid water-methanol mixtures. For this purpose the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations are employed. Our principal focus is on the united atom non-polarizable UAM-I-EW model for methanol which was recently parametrized the paper by Garcia-Melgarejo et al. [J. Mol. Liq., 2021, 323, 114576], combined with the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ water model. In perspective, the methanol model permits a convenient extension for other monohydric alcohols mixed with water. The behavior of density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy are described. Partial mixing properties are interpreted. Besides, we explored the trends of behavior of self-diffusion coefficients of the species of a mixture. The quality of predictions of the model is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Various results are novel and provide new insights into the behavior of the mixtures in question at different temperatures and at high pressures. An improvement of the modelling necessary for further research is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Entropy of a restricted primitive model electrolyte using a mean electrostatic potential approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Lamperski, L. B. Bhuiyan, C. W. Outhwaite, R. Gorniak</p>
            <p>The excess entropy of restricted primitive model electrolytes is calculated using a potential based approach through the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. The theories are utilized in conjunction with a statistical thermodynamics equation that is shown to be equivalent to thermodynamic integration. Electrolyte systems having ionic valencies 1:1 and 2:2 with diameters $3 \times 10^{-10}$~m and 4.25 $\times 10^{-10}$ m are treated over a wide range of concentrations. The exact radial distribution functions for the model electrolytes obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble are compared with the corresponding theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions from the theories and the simulations are used in the Laird-Haymet entropy expansion equations [J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3775] to estimate the excess entropy of the solutions. These equations take into account multi-particle distribution functions, which are approximated using a ``ring'' term. In general, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives results that are more consistent with the simulation data than those from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The results show that the excess entropy is negative with its absolute value increasing for 1:1 electrolytes with increasing concentration. The symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly overestimated, while the modified Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly underestimated relative to the simulations. The curves for 1:1 electrolytes including that from the Laird-Haymet equations are consistent with each other, while only the MPB curves for 2:2 electrolytes at $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m are qualitative relative to the simulations up to about 1 mol/dm$^{3}$.

            <h2>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuichi Shindou, Pengwei Zhao</p>
            <p>U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</p>

Generally, the mean spherical approximation and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory reproduce the benchmark simulation data well up to $\sim $1.6 mol/dm$^{3}$ or more in many instances, while the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann results show discrepancies starting from $\sim $0.25 mol/dm$^{3}$.

            <h2>Quasi-Brittle Fracture: The Blended Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Semsi Coskun, Davood Damircheli, Robert Lipton</p>
            <p>A field theory is presented for predicting damage and fracture in quasi-brittle materials. The approach taken here is new and blends a non-local constitutive law with a two-point phase field. In this formulation, the material displacement field is uniquely determined by the initial boundary value problem. The theory naturally satisfies energy balance, with positive energy dissipation rate in accord with the Clausius-Duhem inequality. Notably, these properties are not imposed but follow directly from the constitutive law and evolution equation when multiplying the equation of motion by the velocity and integrating by parts. In addition to elastic constants, the model requires at most three key material parameters: the strain at the onset of nonlinearity, the ultimate tensile strength, and the fracture toughness. The approach simplifies parameter identification while ensuring representation of material behavior. The approach seamlessly handles fracture evolution across loading regimes, from quasi-static to dynamic, accommodating both fast crack propagation and quasi-brittle failure under monotonic and cyclic loading. Numerical simulations show quantitative and qualitative agreement with experiments, including three-point bending tests on concrete. The model successfully captures the cyclic load-deflection response of crack mouth opening displacement, the structural size-effect related to ultimate load and specimen size, fracture originating from corner singularities in L- shaped domains, and bifurcating fast cracks.</p>

            <p>The lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)azanide-triglyme electrolyte plays a critical role in the performance of lithium-ion batteries. However, its solvation structure and transport properties at the atomic scale remain incompletely understood. In this study, we develop an efficient and accurate neuroevolution potential (NEP) model by integrating bootstrap and active learning strategies. Using machine-learned NEP-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the structural and diffusion properties of LiTFSI/G3 across a wide range of the solute-to-solvent ratios, systematically analyzing electrolyte density, ion coordination, viscosity, and lithium self-diffusion. The computed densities show excellent agreement with experimental data, and pair correlation analysis reveals significant interactions between lithium ions and surrounding oxygen atoms, which strongly impacts Li$^+$ mobility. Viscosity and diffusion calculations further demonstrate that increasing LiTFSI concentration enhances Li-O interactions, resulting in higher viscosity and reduced lithium diffusion. Additionally, machine learning-based path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations confirm the negligible impact of quantum effects on Li$^+$ transport. The electrolyte-specific protocol developed in this work provides a systematic framework for constructing high-fidelity machine learning potentials for complex systems.</p>

            <p>We show the possibility of simulating a dual universe in a pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), wherein two phononic modes experience distinct curved spacetime metrics. Through ramping the interspecies interaction of the BEC, we observe that one universe expands, and in the mean time, the other contracts. These findings can be directly verified in existing cold-atom experimental setups by detecting the correlators of the scaled density contrast (SDC): The sizes of the expanded/contracted universes can be deduced from the SDC's oscillating frequencies, while the expanding/contracting histories are reflected in the SDC's amplitude. Our study demonstrates the great potential of spinor BECs for exploring multiverse-related physics in laboratory settings.</p>

            <p>Mathematical crystal chemistry views crystal structures as the optimal solutions of mathematical optimization problem formalizing inorganic structural chemistry. This paper introduces the minimum and maximum atomic radii depending on the types of geometrical constraints, extending the concept of effective atomic sizes. These radii define permissible interatomic distances instead of interatomic forces, constraining feasible types and connections of coordination polyhedra. The definition shows the aspect that crystal structures are packings of atomic spheres. Additionally, creatability functions for geometrical constraints, which give a choice of creatable types of geometrical constraints depending on the spatial order of atoms, are implemented to guide randomly generated structures toward optimal solutions. The framework identifies unique optimal solutions corresponding to the structures of spinel, pyrochlore ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), pyroxene, quadruple perovskite, cuprate superconductor $\mathrm{YBa}_2 \mathrm{Cu}_3 \mathrm{O}_{7-x}$, and iron-based superconductor $\mathrm{LaFeAsO}$. Notably, up to $95\%$ of oxide crystal structure types in Inorganic Crystal Structure Database align with the optimal solutions preserving experimental structures despite the discretized feasible atomic radii. These findings highlight the role of mathematical optimization problem as a theoretical foundation for mathematical crystal chemistry, enabling efficient structure prediction.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit torque (SOT) presents a promising avenue for energy-efficient spintronics devices, surpassing the limitations of spin transfer torque. While extensively studied in heavy metals, SOT in antiferromagnetic quantum materials remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SOT in epitaxial FeSn, a collinear antiferromagnet with a kagome lattice. FeSn exhibits intriguing topological quantum features, including two-dimensional flat bands and Dirac-like surface states, making it an ideal platform for investigating emergent SOT properties. Using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, we uncover a six-fold symmetric damping-like SOT in epitaxial-FeSn/Py heterostructures, reflecting the six-fold symmetry of the epitaxial [0001]-oriented FeSn films. Additionally, we observe a substantial unconventional field-like torque, originating from spin currents with out-of-plane spin polarization. This torque exhibits a unique angular dependence-a superposition of six-fold crystalline symmetry and uniaxial symmetry associated with the antiferromagnetic spin Hall effect. Notably, the unconventional field-like torque is enhanced when the RF current flows along the Neel vector in FeSn. Our findings reveal an unconventional spin current anisotropy tunable by crystalline and magnetic symmetry, offering a novel approach for controlling SOT in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Renormalization group analysis reveals universality classes of stochastic spiking neuron networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Braden A. W. Brinkman</p>
            <p>The critical brain hypothesis posits that neural circuits may operate close to ``critical points'' -- boundaries between different phases of collective activity. This has been argued to have functional benefits for neural computation. Studies investigating whether neural circuits are poised near critical points have largely relied on establishing power laws in neural data, while a fundamental understanding of critical phenomena requires a renormalization group (RG) analysis. However, neural activity is typically non-Gaussian, nonlinear, and non-local, rendering models that capture all of these features difficult to study using standard statistical physics techniques. We overcome these issues and adapt the non-perturbative renormalization group (NPRG) to provide the first RG analysis of networks of stochastic spiking neurons. We show that neural populations can belong to at least two important universality classes: 1) in networks with an absorbing state there is a transition between sustained and extinguished activity that belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and 2) in spontaneously active networks there is a continuous transition between high and low firing rate states that belongs to the Ising model universality class. We verify our theoretical results by simulating the network model on lattices in $2$ and $3$ dimensions, recovering known exponents, and then investigate critical phenomena in networks of sparsely-connected excitatory neurons and densely-connected inhibitory neurons. Depending on the amount of inhibitory feedback, these networks may display mean-field exponents or anomalous exponents close to -- but potentially not equal to -- lattices of the same effective dimension.</p>

            <h2>Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasser Almoteri, Enkeleida Lushi</p>
            <p>Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective this http URL entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesca Mignacco, Chi-Ning Chou, SueYeon Chung</p>
            <p>Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. To address this limitation, we introduce a theoretical framework that leverages latent directions in input space, which can be related to contextual information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent manifold capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation reformatting in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxiang Xu, Jiangke Tao, Bin Chen</p>
            <p>While the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) play crucial roles in transforming ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work across diverse biological systems, the exact temporal relationship between these events continues to be intensely debated, primarily due to their occurrence at extremely small spatiotemporal scales. In this study, we employ a functional approach to computationally investigate the impact of relatively slow Pi-release kinetics during the power stroke on muscle contraction dynamics. By implementing a mechanics model of the sarcomere unit that comprehensively incorporates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosin molecules, we demonstrate that delayed Pi-release significantly enhances energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our simulation results, obtained through parameter variation, successfully replicate a broad range of experimental observations. This work suggests that a gradual Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the lever arm swing may offer a route to adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance.</p>

Additionally, platforms such as the Anomalous Diffusion Challenge that serve as benchmarks for evaluating these methods are highlighted.

            <p>Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters, although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. This is due to the constraint on the form of multiconfigurational state imposed by the BS determinant, a feature common to other single-reference methods too. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.</p>

Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual Rényi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</p>

            <p>We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincaré Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingyuan Wang, Romain Vasseur, Simon Trebst, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Guo-Yi Zhu</p>
            <p>Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a larger quantum many-body state, while generating entanglement for its remaining constituents. We demonstrate generally that measurement-induced phase transitions can be viewed as decoherence-induced critical mixed states. In this context, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for with regard to symmetry as an organizing principle. Integrating these connections we investigate the role of self-dual symmetry in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric (e) and magnetic (m) vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or equivalently, a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class D with target space SO(2N)/U(N) at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, and represents a "measurement-version" of the Cho-Fisher network model subjected to Born-rule randomness. Explicit breaking of self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or (non-interacting) coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits. Using an unbiased numerical approach combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram as diagnosed by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point to a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</p>

            <p>Active and diffusive motion in Brownian particles are regularly observed in fluidic environments, albeit at different time scales. Here, we experimentally study the dynamics of highly asymmetric microclusters trapped in air employing photophoretic forces generated from a loosely focused laser beam, where the trapped particles display active and diffusive dynamics simultaneously in orthogonal spatial directions. Thus, particle motion in the longitudinal direction ($z$) is enslaved to irregular kicks that naturally arise from an interplay of gravitational and photophoretic forces. This leads to a bimodal nature of the probability distribution function with a near-ballistic scaling of mean-squared displacement in the $z$ direction demonstrating active like dynamics, while the dynamics along the transverse ($x$) direction displays diffusive behaviour with a strong dependence on the motion along $z$. To explain these unique characteristics, we developed a 2D-Langevin model of a confined elliptic particle experiencing an additional stochastic force along $z$ to account for the arbitrary jumps. The numerical results show excellent qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. Our findings should pave the way for the design of high-efficiency Brownian engines in air, besides stimulating new research in the emerging field of photophoretic trapping.</p>

By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nLanE-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nLanE-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through SIE4x4 and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</p>

            <p>Cavity magnomechanics combines strong coupling between magnons in a dielectric material and microwave cavity photons with long-lived mechanical resonances. Forming a triple resonance condition, this hybrid quantum system promises many advantages in quantum technologies, yet has never been studied at the cryogenic temperatures required to reveal such quantum properties. We report the first observation of magnomechanics at cryogenic temperatures down to 9 K. The experiment was conducted using a YIG sphere inside a microwave cavity, where we measured both the thermomechanical motion and the temperature-dependence of the magnon linewidth.</p>

            <h2>Metallicity-driven polar transitions in topological epilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo D. Stefanato, Nicolas M. Kawahala, Bianca A. Kawata, Paulo H. O. Rappl, Eduardo Abramof, Felix G. G. Hernandez</p>
            <p>Polar metals, materials that exhibit both electric polarization and high conductivity, can also host topological phases. Because free carriers strongly suppress distortive polar order and change the Fermi level, controlling charge dynamics is crucial for simultaneously tuning ferroelectric and topological phases in the same material. Here, we explore the experimental conditions that enable access to these phases in bismuth-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te epilayers. For samples in the topological phase at $x = 0.5$, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to evaluate their complex permittivity as a function of temperature. We observe a non-monotonic variation in carrier concentration with bismuth doping, indicating a change in carrier type. By tracking the transverse optical phonon mode, we identify a ferroelectric phase transition when distortive polar order emerges below a critical temperature that depends on carrier concentration. We show that bismuth doping controls the metallicity-dependent order parameters in the softening and hardening phases. Our work demonstrates a tunable platform for engineering exotic states of matter that integrate metallicity, ferroelectricity and topology.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic polarons due to spin-length fluctuations in $\boldsymbol{d}^\mathbf{4}$ spin-orbit Mott systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Revenda, Krzysztof Wohlfeld, Jiří Chaloupka</p>
            <p>Mott insulators based on $4d$ and $5d$ transition-metal ions, where spin-orbit interaction plays a key role, can exhibit various forms of unusual magnetism. A particular example is the antiferromagnet Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ containing $d^4$ Ru$^{4+}$ ions. Here the spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the non-magnetic $J=0$ singlet ionic ground state, which gets dynamically mixed - via exchange interactions - with low-energy $J=1$ ionic excitations. Thanks to a sufficient strength of the exchange, these excitations condense and a long-range order emerges. The resulting ordered moments are soft and prone to fluctuations of their effective length. The corresponding amplitude mode appears as a prominent magnetic excitation and complements the conventional magnons involving rotations of the moments. Motivated by this peculiar kind of magnetic order and the specific spectrum of magnetic excitations, we study their influence on the propagation of doped carriers. To this end, we construct a microscopic model including both $d^4$ and $d^5$ degrees of freedom and address the propagation of an injected electron by employing self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the electron shows a combination of both free and a polaronic type of motion, where the mobile carrier strongly interacts with an accompanying cloud of magnetic excitations. Remarkably, in the latter case it is the exotic excitation - the amplitude mode - that is found to dominate over the contribution of magnons. Our soft-spin situation thus largely contrasts with spin polarons widely discussed in the context of doped Heisenberg-like magnets based on rigid spin moments.</p>

            <p>We report on a variety of quantum transport experiments in SnTe nanowire devices. Research on these particular nanowire devices is relevant because of their topological properties and their potential to distinguish surface states owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio that suppresses the bulk contribution to the conductance. We observe a low-resistance and a high-resistance regime. The highly resistive devices display semiconducting and quantum dot behavior caused by microscopic differences in the fabrication, while devices with low resistance show partial superconductivity when in a hybrid superconductor-nanowire configuration or Fabry-Pérot oscillations. The latter suggests quantum interference in a ballistic transport channel, attributed to the 2D surface states in SnTe. The wide variety of quantum transport phenomena demonstrate SnTe nanowires as a promising platform for diverse follow-up experiments and novel device architectures, including the exploration of topological superconductivity and the development of low-energy spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>In kagome metals, flat bands induced by frustrated hopping serve as a platform for strong electronic correlation, while often exhibiting substantial dispersion along the $k_z$ direction due to interlayer coupling. Here, we investigate the superconductivity of the kagome metal LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature. As supported by our first-principles calculations, the lattice expansion along the $c$-axis by chemical pressure mitigates a detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers, thereby reinforcing the three-dimensional localization of flat-band electrons. Providing evidence for LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ as a flat-band hosting superconductor, we demonstrate a simple, yet effective, route to engineer flat bands by uniaxial lattice expansion.</p>

            <p>We present superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on few-layer NbSe$_2$ fully encapsulated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), demonstrating single-photon sensitivity. Our fabrication process preserves the superconducting properties of NbSe$_2$ in nanowires, as confirmed by low-temperature transport measurements that show a critical temperature of $T_c \approx 6.5$ K, comparable to the reported values for unpatterned sheets, and it maintains a contact resistance of $\sim 50 \, \Omega$ at $T = 4$ K. Meandered NbSe$_2$ nanowires exhibit a responsivity of up to $4.9 \times 10^4$ V/W over a spectral range of 650-1550 nm in a closed-cycle cryostat at 4 K, outperforming planar and short-wire devices. The devices achieve a $1/e$ recovery time of $\tau = (135 \pm 36)$ ns, system timing jitter of $j_\text{sys} = (1103 \pm 7)$ ps, and detection efficiency of $\sim 0.01\%$ at $0.95I_c$, with a linear increase in detection probability confirming the single-photon operation. Furthermore, measurements under attenuated pulsed laser (1 MHz) indicate a success rate of up to $33\%$ in detecting individual optical pulses, establishing the platform as a promising candidate for developing efficient single-photon detectors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junsen Wang, Xiangxiang Sun, Wei Zheng</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</p>

            <h2>Direct comparison of stochastic driven nonlinear dynamical systems for combinatorial optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junpeng Hou, Amin Barzegar, Helmut G. Katzgraber</p>
            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Nishimura, Hiromasa Watanabe</p>
            <p>We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</p>

            <p>We analyze the behavior of spin-1 vector bosons in helicoidal spacetime, focusing on photonic modes in helicoidal graphene structures. By solving the fully covariant vector boson equation, we derive exact solutions that describe the quantum states of photons in a curved helicoidal background, revealing their energy spectra, mode profiles, and decay dynamics. We find that the decay times of damped photonic modes range from \(10^{-16}\) to \(10^{-13}\) seconds as the helicoidal pitch (\(a\)) varies from \(10^3\) nanometers to \(1\) nanometer, indicating that the structure efficiently absorbs all photonic modes. Additionally, the probability density functions exhibit time dependence, complementing their spatial variation. These findings provide a foundation for the design of ultrafast graphene photodetectors, graphene photodevices for high-speed optical communications, advanced photonic devices, and quantum materials based on helicoidal graphene for various nanophotonic applications.</p>

            <p>We have investigated the electronic, vibrational, optical, thermal and piezoelectric properties of LiNbO$_3$, LiTaO$_3$ and Li$_2$NbTaO$_6$ using the first-principles calculation based on the density functional theory. It also shows structural phase transition below $T_c$ due to ionic displacement that may alter the properties of material. We have checked the structural stability by calculating the tolerance factor and formation energy before proceeding to the further calculations. The ground state electronic band structures and corresponding density of states show its semiconducting nature with a band gap range of 3.5-3.7 eV. Optical properties such as dielectric function, absorption coefficient, optical conductivity, refractive index, absorbance and reflectance are calculated using time-dependent density functional theory. Furthermore, the piezoelectric properties and Born effective charges were analyzed to find the correlation between them. In these materials, the distortion induced by the small ionic radius of Li$^{+}$ coupled with strong covalent interaction between transition metal and oxygen leads to high spontaneous polarization which can enhance both piezoelectric and optical properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Antonio Sulangi, Willem Farmilo, Andreas Kreisel, Mainak Pal, W. A. Atkinson, P. J. Hirschfeld</p>
            <p>Several recent experiments have challenged the premise that cuprate high-temperature superconductors approach conventional Landau-BCS behavior in the high-doping limit. We argue, based on an analysis of their superconducting spectra, that anomalous properties seen in the most-studied overdoped cuprates require a pairing interaction that is strongly inhomogeneous on nm length scales. This is consistent with recent proposals that the "strange-metal" phase above $T_c$ in the same doping range arises from a spatially random interaction. We show, via mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) calculations and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations, that key features of the observed tunneling spectra are reproduced when both inhomogeneity and thermal phase fluctuations are accounted for. In accord with experiments, BdG calculations find that low-$T$ spectra are highly inhomogeneous and exhibit a low-energy spectral shoulder and broad coherence peaks. However, the spectral gap in this approach becomes homogeneous at high $T$, in contrast to experiments. This is resolved when thermal fluctuations are included; in this case, global phase coherence is lost at the superconducting $T_c$ via a broadened BKT transition, while robust phase-coherent superconducting islands persist well above $T_c$. The local spectrum remains inhomogeneous at $T_c$.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive investigation of the flat-band kagome superconductor LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, which has recently been reported to host charge density wave (CDW) order above room temperature ($T_{CDW} \simeq 400$ K). The stable crystal structure above the CDW transition is identified via soft phonon condensation and confirmed to be harmonically stable through ab initio calculations, consistent with recent X-ray diffraction refinements. The electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is found to be mode-selective, primarily driven by strong interactions between Ru-$B_{3u}$ phonons (local $x$-direction, pointing toward the hexagon center) and Ru-$A_g$ electrons (local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital) within the kagome lattice. Using a spring-ball model, we identify this mode-selective EPC as a universal feature of kagome materials. Employing the newly developed Gaussian approximation of the hopping parameters, we derive an analytical expression for the EPC and demonstrate that superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ is mostly driven by the coupling between the kagome $B_{3u}$ phonons and the $A_g$ electrons. The impact of doping is also investigated, revealing that light hole doping (approximately one hole per unit cell) significantly enhances the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ by 50%, whereas heavy doping induces structural instability and ferromagnetism. Furthermore, high-throughput screening identifies 3063 stable 1:3:2 kagome materials, of which 428 are predicted to exhibit superconductivity with $T_c > 1$ K, and the highest $T_c$ reaching 15 K. These findings establish LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ and related materials as promising platforms for exploring the interplay among kagome flat bands, EPC, and superconductivity. Additionally, they may offer valuable insights into potential limitations on the $T_c$ of flat-band superconductivity in real materials.</p>

The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is reflected by specific patterns of density waves and phase excitations. We employ a classical-field dynamics method and benchmark our results against driven circuit dynamics.

            <p>Vitrimer is an emerging class of sustainable polymers with self-healing capabilities enabled by dynamic covalent adaptive networks. However, their limited molecular diversity constrains their property space and potential applications. Recent development in machine learning (ML) techniques accelerates polymer design by predicting properties and virtually screening candidates, yet the scarcity of available experimental vitrimer data poses challenges in training ML models. To address this, we leverage molecular dynamics (MD) data generated by our previous work to train and benchmark seven ML models covering six feature representations for glass transition temperature (Tg) prediction. By averaging predicted Tg from different models, the model ensemble approach outperforms individual models, allowing for accurate and efficient property prediction on unlabeled datasets. Two novel vitrimers are identified and synthesized, exhibiting experimentally validated higher Tg than existing bifunctional transesterification vitrimers, along with demonstrated healability. This work explores the possibility of using MD data to train ML models in the absence of sufficient experimental data, enabling the discovery of novel, synthesizable polymer chemistries with superior properties. The integrated MD-ML approach offers polymer chemists an efficient tool for designing polymers tailored to diverse applications.</p>

            <p>Artificial spin ice systems are metamaterials composed of interacting nanomagnets arranged on a lattice, exhibiting geometrical frustration and emergent phenomena such as monopole excitations. We explore magnetization dynamics and monopole current control in square artificial spin ice with added vertical control elements. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we examine how localized magnetic fields from these elements influence vertex configurations and domain propagation, enabling directional and polarity control of monopole currents. The control elements suppress monopole nucleation along one edge, steering monopole flow across the lattice, sometimes even against the applied field direction. These elements also reshape the system's energy landscape, producing tailored hysteresis and guided state transitions. Our results offer a strategy for manipulating collective behaviours in artificial spin ice using localized fields. This has implications for magnetic memory, physical reservoir computing, enabling reconfigurable magnetic logic and spin-based information processing, and device architectures requiring directional magnetic charge transport.</p>

            <p>In Weyl semi-metals, the conduction and valence bands intersect at distinct points on the Brillouin zone (Weyl points), which act as monopoles of Berry curvature in momentum space. This nontrivial band topology, identified from electronic structure calculations, gives rise to various exotic magneto-transport properties. Hybrid functional calculations that incorporate a portion of exact exchange, magneto-transport measurements, and temperature-dependent resistivity confirm nontrivial band topology and half-metallicity in CoS$_2$ of magnetic ordering temperature $T_{\rm C} \approx 120~\mathrm{K}$. However, electronic structure calculations also show that application of small strain transforms this half metallic character to the metallic. Interestingly, the magnetoresistance (MR) of the CoS$_2$ films is characterized by a reentrant weak localization above a critical field at $T \leq 60\,\mathrm{K}$ and a negative to positive transition in MR as the $T$ goes from $<T_{\rm C}$ to $>T_{\rm C}$. Experimental observation of anomalous Hall resistivity and $ab~initio$ computed band structure, Berry curvature, and Hall conductivity ($\sigma_{xy}$) demonstrate that the $\sigma_{xy}$ in CoS$_2$ is primarily driven by the intrinsic Karplus-Luttinger contribution, often linked to Berry phase physics.</p>

            <p>Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems at the interfaces of layered materials are highly desirable platforms for exploring of novel quantum phenomena and developing advanced device applications. Here, we investigate ultrathin heterostructures composed of SrIrO3 (SIO) and SrRuO3 (SRO) layers to uncover their emergent properties. Strikingly, despite the fact that both individual layers are antiferromagnetic insulators, the interfaced heterostructure exhibits emergent metallicity. Through transport measurements, magnetic characterization, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we analyze the underlying mechanisms governing this insulator-to-metal transition. Our findings reveal that the transition is driven by interface-induced magnetic reconstruction, which is further corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the SIO/SRO interface is identified as the key driving force for this spin reorganization, as it stabilizes ferromagnetism in the coupled antiferromagnetic insulating layers. These findings highlight the significant potential of engineering interfacial magnetic interactions as a powerful approach to generate and control emergent electronic properties, paving the way for novel functionalities that are unattainable in individual ultrathin films.</p>

            <p>High density data storage and spin-logic devices require highly efficient all-electric control of spin moments. So far, charge-to-spin conversion through the spin Hall effect limits to d-orbital materials associated with strong spin-orbit coupling, especially heavy metals. However, d-orbital heavy metals with strong spin-orbit coupling results in a short spin diffusion length, which restricts the spin transport and accumulation in spintronic devices. Therefore, the conflict between charge-to-spin conversion efficiency and spin transport ability is irreconcilable in d-orbital materials. Here, we report a large charge to spin conversion experimentally observed in the p-orbital In2Bi alloy, exhibiting the coexistence of a large spin Hall angle comparable to heave metal Pt and a long spin diffusion length (4 times that of Pt). First-principles calculations reveal that topological symmetry-protected gap opening near the Fermi level results in large Berry curvature-related spin Hall conductivity. Due to the delocalized nature of p-orbitals and semimetal properties of In2Bi, its spin current can overcome the physical barriers between spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length in d-orbital metals, thereby advancing the development of high-performance spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern numbers, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-1 system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Resistor-Capacitor Circuit with two Majorana Bound States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Li, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S Tiengo (IOGS, LCF), R Eid (IOGS, LCF), T Bourdel (IOGS, LCF)</p>
            <p>In ultracold atomic gases, radio-frequency coupling between two spin states can lead to atoms being in a stable coherent superposition of the two states (dressed states). When the two-body interactions (scattering lengths) are different between the two states, it offers the possibility not only to control the interatomic interaction but also to modify the equation of states with emerging three-body terms with different signs and scalings with the parameters. We derive these terms in a unified perturbation framework and show that they correspond to genuine three-body processes found at different orders in perturbation theory. Our work justifies the introduction of contact three-body interactions in dressed-state systems when the spin degree of freedom is integrated out.</p>

            <h2>Andreev bound states and supercurrent in an unconventional superconductor-altermagnetic Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Alipourzadeh, Yaser Hajati</p>
            <p>Motivated by the orientation-dependent properties of d-wave superconductors (SCs), we investigate Andreev bound states (ABSs) and Josephson current in s-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (S/AM/D) and d-wave SC/altermagnet/d-wave SC (D/AM/D) junctions. The asymmetric S/AM/D junction exhibits a node-less ABSs spectrum with distinct spin states, arising from AM manipulation. In contrast, a symmetric D/AM/D junction with $\pm 45^\circ$-oriented order parameters exhibits a nodal ABSs spectrum, characterized by spin-split sinusoidal curves. This behavior arises from the angular dependence of the d-wave pairing potential, which introduces a $\pi$-shift in the ABSs spectrum of the D/AM/D junction compared to that of conventional S/AM/S junctions. Additionally, the positions of the ABSs nodes in the D/AM/D junction can be controlled by adjusting the length and strength of the AM layer. Analysis of the free energy and Josephson current reveals additional extrema in the free energy at intermediate phase differences, leading to skewness and a non-sinusoidal behavior in the current-phase relationship of both configurations. These zero-supercurrent phase differences can be tuned by adjusting the properties of the AM layer such as AM strength and length. These findings provide new insights into AM-based Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p>Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a notoriously complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies as well as the complex and periodically changing shapes of these meso-organisms add extra challenges for accurately modelling their dynamics. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to experimentally study the physics of biological meso-swimming dynamics. We directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia sp. and determine how the propulsive force scales with body size. We show that this scaling law is universal for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms, regardless of body shape, swimming strategy, or the addition of inertia at the mesoscale. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we determine the time-reversal symmetry breaking of Artemia as it transitions from the viscous regime to the mesoscale. We discover that this model meso-swimmer achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous structural relaxation is intrinsic to glassy materials due to their metastable nature. For phase-change materials (PCMs), the resultant temporal change in electrical resistance seriously hamper in-memory computing (IMC) applications. Here, we report an ab-initio-calculation-informed design of amorphous PCM composed of robust "molecule-like" motifs with minimal Peierls distortion, depriving the amorphous alloy of structural ingredients that would gradually evolve upon aging to entail resistance drift. We demonstrate amorphous CrTe3 thin films that display practically no resistance drift at any working temperature from -200 to 165 degree C. We achieve multilevel programming of CrTe3 through both step-wise crystallization and step-wise amorphization using a hybrid opto-electronic device at various temperatures. Moreover, the application potential of CrTe3 in neuromorphic computing is testified by its incorporation in a vehicle with automatic path-tracking function. Our work opens a new avenue to achieving IMC-requisite properties via judicious design of the composition and atomic-level structure of disordered PCM alloys.</p>

            <p>UTe2 is a promising candidate for spin-triplet superconductor, yet its exact superconducting order parameter remains highly debated. Here, via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observe a novel type of magnetic vortex with distinct dark-bright contrast in the local density of states on the UTe2 (011) surface under a perpendicular magnetic field, resembling the Yin-Yang diagram in Taoism. Each Yin-Yang vortex contains a quantized magnetic flux, and the boundary between the Yin and Yang parts aligns with the crystallographic a-axis of UTe2. The vortex states exhibit intriguing behaviors -- a sharp zero-energy conductance peak exists at the Yang part, while a superconducting gap feature with pronounced coherence peaks exists at the Yin part, which is even sharper than those measured far from the vortex core or in the absence of magnetic field. Assisted by numerical simulations, we show that the Yin-Yang vortices on the UTe2 (011) surface arise from the interplay between the gapless surface states associated with spin-triplet pairing and the vortex bound states because of the cylindrical squarish Fermi surface of UTe2. Therefore, the observation of Yin-Yang vortex is strong evidence of the gapless surface states on UTe2 (011) surface, which rules out the possibility of B2u pairing symmetry.</p>

            <p>Flat bands in graphene-based moiré structures host a wide range of emerging strongly correlated and topological phenomena. Optically probing and controlling them can reveal important information such as symmetry and dynamics, but have so far been challenging due to the small energy gap compared to optical wavelengths. Here, we report near infrared optical control of orbital magnetism and associated anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in a magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) on monolayer WSe$_2$ device. We show that the properties of the AHE, such as hysteresis and amplitude, can be controlled by light near integer moiré fillings, where spontaneous ferromagnetism exists. By modulating the light helicity, we observe periodic modulation of the transverse resistance in a wide range of fillings, indicating light induced orbital magnetization through a large inverse Faraday effect. At the transition between metallic and AHE regimes, we also reveal large and random switching of the Hall resistivity, which are attributed to optical control of percolating cluster of magnetic domains. Our results open the door to optical manipulation of correlation and topology in MATBG and related structures.</p>

            <p>Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the first experimental observation of the long-lived prethermal phases with tunable heating rates in many-body systems, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by the $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and the subsystem entanglement entropy, we trace out the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and confirm the existence of the prethermal plateau. Its lifetime grows algebraically with the driving frequency and the scaling exponent is approximately $2n{+}1$, tunable by the multipolar order. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from the area-law to the volume-law entanglement scaling. We utilize all 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, and their entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work underscores superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.</p>

            <h2>Superfluid density in linear response theory : pulsar glitches from the inner crust of neutron stars</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgio Almirante, Michael Urban</p>
            <p>The question of whether there are enough superfluid neutrons in the inner crust of neutron stars to explain pulsar glitches remains a topic of debate. Previous band structure calculations suggest that the entrainment effect significantly reduces the superfluid density. In this letter, a new derivation of the BCS expression for the superfluid density is given. We compute it in the superfluid band theory framework through linear response theory, for a small relative velocity between superfluid and normal components, under the assumption that the pairing gap in the rest frame of the superfluid is constant and not affected by the perturbation. Our result suggests that a formula extensively used in neutron star physics is incomplete. Numerical evaluations for two realistic configurations reveal that the previously neglected contribution drastically alters the picture of the superfluid reservoir in the inner crust of neutron stars, suggesting that about 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid.</p>

            <p>Methods for reconstructing the spectral density of a vibrational environment from experimental data can yield key insights into the impact of the environment on molecular function. Although such experimental methods exist, they generally only access vibrational modes that couple diagonally to the electron system. Here we present a method for extracting the spectral density of modes that couple to the transition between electronic states, using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.</p>

            <p>Liquid crystals consisting of biaxial particles can exhibit a much richer phase behavior than their uniaxial counterparts. Usually, one has to rely on simulation results to understand the phase diagram of these systems, since very few analytical results exist. In this work, we apply fundamental measure theory, which allows us to derive free energy functionals for hard particles from first principles and with high accuracy, to systems of hard cylinders, cones and spherotriangles. We provide a general recipe for incorporating biaxial liquid crystal order parameters into fundamental measure theory and use this framework to obtain the phase boundaries for the emergence of orientational order in the considered systems. Our results provide insights into the phase behavior of biaxial nematic liquid crystals and, in particular, into methods for their analytical investigation.</p>

Overall, our analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect, as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of $J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of materials.</p>

            <p>The Central Limit Theorem does not hold for strongly correlated stochastic variables, as is the case for statistical systems close to criticality. Recently, the calculation of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the magnetization mode has been performed with the functional renormalization group in the case of the three-dimensional Ising model [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)]. It has been shown in that article that there exists an entire family of universal PDFs parameterized by $\zeta=\lim_{L,\xi_\infty\rightarrow\infty} L/\xi_\infty$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed perturbatively in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion. We determine the whole family of universal PDFs and show that they are in good qualitative agreement with Monte Carlo data. Finally, we conjecture on how to significantly improve the quantitative agreement between the one-loop and the numerical results.</p>

            <p>The $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid might realize an exotic phase of matter whose low-energy properties are described by quantum electrodynamics in $2+1$ dimensions, where gapless modes exists but spinons and gauge fields are strongly coupled. Its existence has been proposed in frustrated Heisenberg models in presence of frustrating super-exchange interactions, by the (Abrikosov) fermionic representation of the spin operators [X.-G. Wen, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B {\bf 65}, 165113 (2002)}], supplemented by the Gutzwiller projection. Here, we construct charge-$Q$ monopole excitations in the Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice with nearest- ($J_1$) and next-neighbor ($J_2$) couplings. In the highly frustrated regime, singlet and triplet monopoles with $Q=1$ become gapless in the thermodynamic limit; in addition, the energies for generic $Q$ agree with field-theoretical predictions, obtained for a large number of gapless fermion modes. Finally, we consider localized gauge excitations, in which magnetic $\pi$-fluxes are concentrated in the triangular plaquettes (in analogy with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ visons), showing that these kind of states do not play a relevant role at low energies. All our findings lend support to a stable $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid in the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice.</p>

            <p>In materials with one-dimensional electronic bands, electron-electron interactions can produce intriguing quantum phenomena, including spin-charge separation and charge density waves (CDW). Most of these systems, however, are non-magnetic, motivating a search for anisotropic materials where the coupling of charge and spin may affect emergent quantum states. Here, chemical intercalation of the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr yields $Li_{0.17(2)} (tetrahydrofuran)_{0.26(3)} CrSBr$, which possess an electronically driven quasi-1D CDW with an onset temperature above room temperature. Concurrently, electron doping increases the magnetic ordering temperature from 132 K to 200 K and switches its interlayer magnetic coupling from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. The spin-polarized nature of the anisotropic bands that give rise to this CDW enforces an intrinsic coupling of charge and spin. The coexistence and interplay of ferromagnetism and charge modulation in this exfoliatable material provides a promising platform for studying tunable quantum phenomena across a range of temperatures and thicknesses.</p>

            <p>The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. For a Fermi liquid, we find that the QFI grows quadratically as the temperature increases, consistent then with the phase space available for scattering in the standard theory of metals. By contrast, the QFI in a strange metal increases as a power law at as the temperature decreases, but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</p>

            <p>Accurate prediction of electronic band gaps in halide perovskites using density functional theory is crucial for optoelectronic applications. Standard hybrid functionals like HSE and PBE0 are becoming computationally accessible, yet can fail at predicting the band gaps for three-dimensional (3D) and/or layered halide perovskite. This study evaluates the doubly screened dielectric-dependent hybrid (DSH) functional for predicting band gaps of Pb- and Sn-based inorganic and hybrid 3D halide perovskites, as well as layered hybrid perovskites. The DSH functional employs material-dependent mixing parameters derived from macroscopic dielectric constants, and accurately predicts band gaps for 3D perovskites only if structural local disorder is taken into account. For layered hybrid perovskites, the DSH functional based on average dielectric constants tends to overestimate the band gaps. To improve predictions, we propose using the calculated dielectric constant of the respective 3D perovskites to define the DSH screening. This method is then applied to Pb- and Sn-based layered halide perovskites with various organic spacers and multilayered structures, such as $BA_2MA_{n-1}Pb_{n}I_{3n-1}$ with n =1, 2, 3, resulting in improved precision. The HSE functional systematically underestimates band gaps in layered perovskites due to the missing non-local long-range dielectric screening. On the other hand, the PBE0 is in good agreement with the experimental values, in particular for the layered iodide perovskites. The computational framework introduced here provides an efficient parameter-free \textit{ab initio} methodology suitable for predicting the electronic properties of 3D, layered halide perovskites and their heterostructures, towards modelling materials for advanced optoelectronic devices</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mrinal Sarkar, Shamik Gupta</p>
            <p>We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty is more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb, and also explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.</p>

            <p>The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is further amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize due to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational complexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU implementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the thousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By adopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive density functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is capable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability, we performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure evolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW, in which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb mechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected nanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of the nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography (APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations. This work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC simulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure evolution in HEAs.</p>

            <h2>Small-Mass Asymptotics of Massive Point Vortex Dynamics in Bose--Einstein Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoki Ohsawa, Andrea Richaud</p>
            <p>We perform an asymptotic analysis of the massive point vortex dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensates in the small-mass limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We show that the orthogonal projection of the massive dynamics to a certain subspace $\mathcal{K}$ (called kinematic subspace) in the phase space yields the standard massless vortex dynamics or the Kirchhoff equations. We show that the massless dynamics is the zeroth-order approximation to the massive equation as $\varepsilon \to 0$, and also derive a first-order correction to the zeroth-order massless dynamics. The massive dynamics near $\mathcal{K}$ is well approximated by the corresponding massless dynamics. In fact, our main result proves that the massive dynamics starting in $\mathcal{K}$ stays $O(\varepsilon)$-close to $\mathcal{K}$ for short time. On the other hand, the massive dynamics starting outside $\mathcal{K}$ exhibits an oscillatory initial layer due to its inertia and deviates significantly from the massless dynamics. We also perform an asymptotic analysis with a rescaled time to derive the inner approximation to capture the initial layer. The 0th-order inner equations are exactly solvable, and the 1st-order inner equations can be solved by quadrature. The combined inner approximation captures the initial oscillatory layer of the massive dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Floquet control of topological phases and Hall effects in Z2 nodal line semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pu Liu, Chaoxi Cui, Lei Li, Runze Li, Dong-Hui Xu, Zhi-Ming Yu</p>
            <p>Dynamic control of topological properties in materials is central to modern condensed matter physics, and Floquet engineering, utilizing periodic light fields, provides a promising avenue. Here, we use Floquet theory to theoretically study the topological response of a Z2 nodal line semimetal (NLSM) when driven by circularly polarized light (CPL). We demonstrate that the direction of CPL irradiation critically dictates the resulting topological phase transitions. Specifically, when light is incident perpendicular to the nodal line plane, increasing the light amplitude induces two successive topological phase transitions: first, from the Z2 NLSM to a vortex NLSM, a rare and intriguing topological state; and second, a transition from the vortex NLSM to a semimetal with a pair of Weyl points (WPs). In stark contrast, irradiation along other directions directly transforms the Z2 nodal line into a pair of WPs. We further investigate the transport properties of the Floquet Z2 NLSM, focusing on the anomalous and planar Hall effects. The anomalous Hall effect exhibits a direction-dependent amplitude variation, deviating from conventional two-band NLSM behavior. Importantly, we reveal a significant and tunable planar Hall effect, a phenomenon largely unexplored in Floquet topological materials, which is highly sensitive to both light amplitude and direction. Our findings not only present a novel route to realize the vortex NLSM, but also establish an efficient way to control Hall transport phenomena in Z2 NLSMs.</p>

            <h2>Mixed radix numeration bases: Horner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damien Simon</p>
            <p>Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known Horner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glen Evenbly, Nicola Pancotti, Ashley Milsted, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan</p>
            <p>Belief propagation (BP) can be a useful tool to approximately contract a tensor network, provided that the contributions from any closed loops in the network are sufficiently weak. In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Enrico Trizio, Peilin Kang, Michele Parrinello</p>
            <p>The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</p>

            <h2>Average-case matrix discrepancy: satisfiability bounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Maillard</p>
            <p>Given a sequence of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$, and a margin $\Delta > 0$, we investigate whether it is possible to find signs $(\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_n) \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ such that the operator norm of the signed sum satisfies $\|\sum_{i=1}^n \epsilon_i \mathbf{W}_i\|_{\rm op} \leq \Delta$. Kunisky and Zhang (2023) recently introduced a random version of this problem, where the matrices $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This model can be seen as a random variant of the celebrated Matrix Spencer conjecture and as a matrix-valued analog of the symmetric binary perceptron in statistical physics. In this work, we establish a satisfiability transition in this problem as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \tau > 0$. First, we prove that the expected number of solutions with margin $\Delta=\kappa \sqrt{n}$ has a sharp threshold at a critical $\tau_1(\kappa)$: for $\tau < \tau_1(\kappa)$ the problem is typically unsatisfiable, while for $\tau > \tau_1(\kappa)$ the average number of solutions is exponentially large. Second, combining a second-moment method with recent results from Altschuler (2023) on margin concentration in perceptron-type problems, we identify a second threshold $\tau_2(\kappa)$, such that for $\tau>\tau_2(\kappa)$ the problem admits solutions with high probability. In particular, we establish that a system of $n = \Theta(d^2)$ Gaussian random matrices can be balanced so that the spectrum of the resulting matrix macroscopically shrinks compared to the semicircle law. Finally, under a technical assumption, we show that there exists values of $(\tau,\kappa)$ for which the number of solutions has large variance, implying the failure of the second moment method. Our proofs rely on establishing concentration and large deviation properties of correlated Gaussian matrices under spectral norm constraints.</p>

            <h2>Geometry effect of the dynamical quantum phase transitions at finite temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) probe the nonequilibrium evolution of quantum systems, unveiling their geometric and topological characteristics. In this study, we introduce the concepts of parallel quench and dynamic geometrical order parameter (DGOP) for non-band models, where these quantities capture the geometric shifts associated with DQPTs. At zero temperature, the DGOP corresponds to the Pancharatnam geometric phase, while at finite temperatures, it extends to the interferometric geometric phase. We further generalize the dynamic topological order parameter (DTOP) to finite-temperature band models, examining its behavior in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our analysis shows that thermal fluctuations and boundary effects at finite temperatures disrupt the quantization of the DTOP, yet it retains signatures of topological transitions. These findings deepen the understanding of geometric and topological properties in quantum dynamics, illuminating DQPTs across both non-band and band frameworks.</p>

            <p>To analyse how diffusion models learn correlations beyond Gaussian ones, we study the behaviour of higher-order cumulants, or connected n-point functions, under both the forward and backward process. We derive explicit expressions for the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function, higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.</p>

            <p>Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</p>

            <p>Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</p>

            <h2>Gross-Neveu-XY quantum criticality in moiré Dirac materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bilal Hawashin, Michael M. Scherer, Lukas Janssen</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional van-der-Waals materials offer a highly tunable platform for engineering electronic band structures and interactions. By employing techniques such as twisting, gating, or applying pressure, these systems enable precise control over the electronic excitation spectrum. In moiré bilayer graphene, the tunability facilitates the transition from a symmetric Dirac semimetal phase through a quantum critical point into an interaction-induced long-range ordered phase with a finite band gap. At charge neutrality, the ordered state proposed to emerge from twist-angle tuning is the Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator. In this case, the transition falls into the quantum universality class of the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY model in 2+1 dimensions. Here, we refine estimates for the critical exponents characterizing this universality class using an expansion around the lower critical space-time dimension of two. We compute the order-parameter anomalous dimension $\eta_\varphi$ and the correlation-length exponent $\nu$ at one-loop order, and the fermion anomalous dimension $\eta_\psi$ at two-loop order. Combining these results with previous findings from the expansion around the upper critical dimension, we obtain improved estimates for the universal exponents in $2+1$ dimensions via Padé interpolation. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ four-component Dirac fermions, relevant to moiré bilayer graphene, we estimate $1/\nu=0.916(5)$, $\eta_\varphi=0.926(13)$, and $\eta_\psi=0.0404(13)$. For $N_\mathrm{f} = 2$, potentially relevant to recent tetralayer WSe$_2$ experiments, the Gross-Neveu-XY fixed point may be unstable due to a fixed-point collision at $N_\mathrm{f,c}$, with $N_\mathrm{f,c} = 1 + \sqrt{2} + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ in the expansion around the lower critical dimension.</p>

            <h2>Emulation of quantum correlations by classical dynamics in a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain</h2>

            <p>We simulate the dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) S(q,w) of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain using classical simulations. By employing Landau-Lifshitz Dynamics, we emulate quantum correlations through temperature-dependent corrections, including rescaling of magnetic dipoles and renormalization of exchange interactions. Our results demonstrate that the quantum-equivalent DSSF closely matches Quantum Monte-Carlo calculations for kBT/J ~ 1, capturing the continuum of magnetic excitations observed in neutron scattering measurements. At higher temperatures, our simulations comply with general predictions by De Gennes, where the pinched-oval spectral continuum reflects the uncorrelated paramagnetic fluctuations in the infinite temperature limit. Surprisingly, entanglement witnesses extracted from the quantum-equivalent DSSF mimic quantum calculations across all temperatures, despite relying on classical dynamics. However, classical simulations fail to reproduce higher energy spectral weight from spinon excitations at lower temperatures and struggle to explain the system behavior at intermediate temperatures and magnetic fields. Our approach highlights the potential of classical dynamics to emulate quantum effects even in the most extreme spin systems, with implications for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</p>

            <p>The search for Kitaev's quantum spin liquid (KQSL) state in real materials has recently expanded with the prediction that honeycomb lattices of divalent, high-spin cobalt ions could host the dominant bond-dependent exchange interactions required to stabilize the elusive entangled quantum state. The layered honeycomb Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ has been singled out as a leading candidate provided that the trigonal crystal field acting on Co $3d$ orbitals, which enhances non-Kitaev exchange interactions between $J_{\rm eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ spin-orbital pseudospins, is reduced. We find that applied pressure leads to anisotropic compression of the layered structure, significantly reducing the trigonal distortion of CoO$_6$ octahedra. A strong enhancement of ferromagnetic correlations between pseudospins is observed in the spin-polarized (3 Tesla) phase up to about 60 GPa. Higher pressures drive a spin transition into a low-spin state destroying the $J_{\rm eff}=\frac{1}{2}$ local moments required to map the spin Hamiltonian into Kitaev's model. The spin transition strongly suppresses the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility and appears to stabilize a paramagnetic phase driven by frustration. Although applied pressure fails to realize a KQSL state, the possible emergence of frustrated magnetism of localized, low-spin $S=\frac{1}{2}$ moments opens the door for exploration of novel magnetic quantum states in compressed honeycomb lattices of divalent cobaltates.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice has attracted lots of research interest due to the possible existence of deconfined criticality. In the present work, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$ model using Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method, where $J_1$, $J_2$, $J_4$ stand for the nearest-neighbor, next nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions respectively. An empty plaquette (EP) phase is found with spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking. However, different from the EP phase in literature, the EP phase in our VMC approach is a $Z_2$ deconfined phase with majorana-type gapless spinons in the excitation spectrum. Additionally, a symmetric gapless $Z_2$ Quantum spin liquid phase is found adjacent to the EP phase, full plaquette (FP) and the Neel antiferromagnetic phases. The phase transition from the QSL phase to these ordered phases are found to be continuous. While the transition to the EP phase is of Landau type, the transitions to the Neel phase and the FP phase can be interpreted as condensation of $Z_2$ gauge charge ($e$ particle) and flux ($m$ particle).</p>

            <p>A large anomalous Nernst effect is essential for thermoelectric energy harvesting in the transverse geometry without external magnetic field. It is often connected with anomalous Hall effect, especially when electronic Berry curvature is believed to be the driving force. This approach implicitly assumes the same symmetry for the Nernst and Hall coefficients, which is however not necessarily true. Here we report a large anomalous Nernst effect in antiferromagnetic SrIr$_{0.8}$Sn$_{0.2}$O$_3$ that defies the antisymmetric constraint on the anomalous Hall effect imposed by the Onsager reciprocal relation. The observed spontaneous Nernst thermopower quickly reaches the sub-$\mu$V/K level below the Néel transition around 250 K, which is comparable with many topological antiferromagnetic semimetals and far excels other magnetic oxides. Our analysis indicates that the coexistence of significant symmetric and antisymmetric contributions plays a key role, pointing to the importance of extracting both contributions and a new pathway to enhanced anomalous Nernst effect for transverse thermoelectrics</p>

            <p>The doping dependence of the superfluid density $\rho_{\text{s}}$ exhibits distinct behaviors in the underdoping and overdoping regimes of the cuprate, while the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_c$ is generally scaled with $\rho_{\text{s}}$.

Within this framework, the SC phase fluctuations are deeply intertwined with the spin dynamics, such that thermally excited neutral spins determine $T_c$, while quantum spin excitations effectively reduce the superfluid density at zero temperature. As a result, a Uemura-like scaling of $T_c$ vs. $\rho_{\text{s}}$ in the underdoped regime naturally emerges, while the suppression of both $T_c$ and $\rho_{\text{s}}$ at overdoping is attributed to a drastic reduction of antiferromagnetic spin correlations.</p>

            <p>The process of spin-charge interconversion is critical in modern spintronics. Nonetheless, experiments conducted on a wide variety of magnetic heterostructures consistently report that charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion efficiencies can be vastly different, especially in the case of topological insulators (TI). This discrepancy between the two "reciprocal" effects remains unexplained, hampering the development of spin devices based on spin-charge conversion. In this study, we investigate both spin-charge and charge-spin interconversion processes in TI Bi2Te3/Py and Pt/Py bilayers experimentally using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance and spin pumping techniques. We find that the measured charge-to-spin conversion efficiency (C-S) in TI/Py is ~26 times larger than the measured spin-to-charge conversion efficiency (S-C), whereas C-S and S-C are comparable in the case of Pt/Py. Using a theoretical model enforcing Onsager reciprocity, we show that spin-to-charge and charge-to-spin conversions in bilayers are genuinely inequivalent, and explain our results as arising from the distinct spin current leakage that takes place during the interconversion. This work clarifies previous conflicting reports on spin-charge interconversion processes and highlights the potential of interface engineering to achieve efficient spin transport in TI-based ferromagnetic heterostructures, paving the way for highly efficient spintronic devices.</p>

We detect that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, reflecting distinct ground states characteristic of Gd-containing compounds. Using negativity as a quantum entanglement measure, we analyze the effects of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite and bipartite entanglements in two families of Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong tetrapartite entanglement, persisting up to $T \approx 2.5$ K and $B \approx 4.0$ T, but considerably weak bipartite entanglement between Ni$\cdots$Ni and Ni$\cdots$Gd links. Conversely, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ shows strong bipartite entanglements but negligible tetrapartite entanglement negativity.

            <p>We study the critical behavior driven by potential quantum critical points (QCPs) termed as $\tau_{0,x,y,z}$-Type QCPs in the $d$-wave cuprate superconductors. Within the framework of the renormalization group approach, we construct the coupled flow equations of all interaction parameters and obtain several unique properties. On one hand, the interaction parameters flow toward several fixed points (FPs) at certain critical energy scales. We identify two different types of FPs designated at the clean limit. FP-I is characterized by the divergence of the quadratic parameter and exhibits robustness against variations in interaction parameters. In contrast, FP-II is dominated by the cubic and quartic interaction parameters, and it is sensitive to initial conditions, leading to five subclasses. Besides, we find that disorder scattering can influence fermion velocities and critical energy scales, and even destabilize certain FPs around the $\tau_{x,z}$-QCPs, driving the system toward a preempted disorder-induced FP. On the other hand, we find that quantum fluctuations play a critical role in shaping the critical temperature ($T_c$) as the system approaches these QCPs. Near the $\tau_x$-QCP, $T_c$ is considerably suppressed for both FP-I and FP-II. In contrast, near the $\tau_0$-QCP, $T_c$ undergoes a substantial decrease for FP-I but only a slight decrease for FP-II. Conversely, $T_c$ exhibits an increasing trend near the $\tau_y$-QCP, with a pronounced peak at $v_{\Delta 0}/v_{F0} \sim 0.25$. However, numerical analysis suggests that the $\tau_z$-QCP is unlikely to be physically realizable. Additionally, we realize that $T_c$ can also be modified by the emergence of disorder-induced FPs in the vicinity of the $\tau_x$-QCP. These findings would provide valuable insights into the critical low-energy properties of $d$-wave cuprate superconductors and related materials.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) with large twist angle is a novel 2D bilayer system with strong interlayer Coulomb interactions, whilst suppressed interlayer carrier tunneling due to momentum mismatch between the Dirac cones of individual graphene layers. This interlayer decoherence disentangles the layer degree of freedom from spin-valley space. We demonstrate the role of charge screening effects in electronically decoupled TBLG that determines the Landau level (LL) crossings and multicomponent Quantum Hall (QH) effect resulting from combinations of broken symmetry states with spin and valley flavors of constituent this http URL N = 0 LL at zero filling factor is characterized by a field-induced Kosterlitz-Thouless transition to an ordered ground state, consistent with predictions of intervalley coherent state of Kekulé order. Pronounced hysteresis and electron-hole asymmetry observed in the QH regime suggests pinning of low-energy topological excitations, i.e., skyrmions with spin and valley textures, at charged defects in graphene channel.</p>

            <p>The ubiquitous tendency of high-temperature superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves has reignited interest in the enigmatic nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their complex phase diagrams. While pronounced anomalies in the dispersion of several phonon branches have been reported, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under extreme conditions of low temperature and high magnetic field we uncover a striking renormalization of the phonon spectra in the model cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting two emblematic CDW states: a two-dimensional short-range CDW emerging above the superconducting transition and a three-dimensional long-range CDW that appears only when superconductivity is suppressed by a strong magnetic field or uniaxial compression. The spectral changes are strongest at the wave vector corresponding to the 3D CDW order despite the fact that the CDW is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models and instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive charge-density-wave excitations. These results provide fresh insights into the intricate interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.</p>

            <p>We explore quantum phase transitions in the multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM). Using the mean-field approximation, we show that multiphoton JCHM reveals quantum phase transitions between the Mott insulator (MI), superfluid and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phases. The multiphoton JCHM MI phases are classified according to a conserved quantity associated with the total number of excited atoms and photons. If this conserved quantity diverges to infinity, this system is in the BEC phase. Exploring this system we observe the MI, BEC, and superfluid phases in both the single- and two-photon JCHMs although the two-photon JCHM MI phases are restricted to the small conserved quantity subspace. Contrastingly, only the superfluid and BEC phases arise in the three- and four-photon JCHMs (the MI phase is not observed).</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Chaos from Free Probability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo A. Camargo, Yichao Fu, Viktor Jahnke, Kuntal Pal, Keun-Young Kim</p>
            <p>A classical dynamical system can be viewed as a probability space equipped with a measure-preserving time evolution map, admitting a purely algebraic formulation in terms of the algebra of bounded functions on the phase space. Similarly, a quantum dynamical system can be formulated using an algebra of bounded operators in a non-commutative probability space equipped with a time evolution map. Chaos, in either setting, can be characterized by statistical independence between observables at $ t = 0 $ and $ t \to \infty $, leading to the vanishing of cumulants involving these observables. In the quantum case, the notion of independence is replaced by free independence, which only emerges in the thermodynamic limit (asymptotic freeness). In this work, we propose a definition of quantum chaos based on asymptotic freeness and investigate its emergence in quantum many-body systems including the mixed-field Ising model with a random magnetic field, a higher spin version of the same model, and the SYK model. The hallmark of asymptotic freeness is the emergence of the free convolution prediction for the spectrum of operators of the form $ A(0) + B(t) $, implying the vanishing of all free cumulants between $A(0)$ and $B(t)$ in the thermodynamic limit for an infinite-temperature thermal state. We systematically investigate the spectral properties of $ A(0) + B(t) $ in the above-mentioned models, show that fluctuations on top of the free convolution prediction follow universal Wigner-Dyson statistics, and discuss the connection with quantum chaos. Finally, we argue that free probability theory provides a rigorous framework for understanding quantum chaos, offering a unifying perspective that connects many different manifestations of it.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr Povitchan, Denys I. Bondar, Andrii G. Sotnikov</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that Lyapunov quantum control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.</p>

            <p>As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang-Jin Sin, Yi-Li Wang</p>
            <p>We show how a strange metal emerges from the long-range quantum entanglements. Given that the quenched average of a spatially random coupling between a Fermi surface and critical bosons results in linear-$T$ resistivity, we first calculate the annealed average of the model and find that it also give the linear resistivity. We then observe that the correlator of the 'coupling field' in quenched average can be interpreted as the wormholes that connect pair of points separated by arbitrary distance, while the annealed average can be interpreted as a pure system without disorder having quantum entanglements between the connected pairs. We show that, in the large-$N$ limit, two averages are equivalent. Therefore we suggest that this equivalence provides insight to the precise meaning of $ER=EPR$ conjecture in the context of an explicit model with well defined computation. Also, we point out that the wormhole picture clarifies why a SYK-rized model describes the strongly interacting system even in the case the averaged coupling strength is tiny.</p>

            <h2>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuichi Shindou, Pengwei Zhao</p>
            <p>U(1) non-linear sigma models (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase are studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations with finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</p>

            <p>Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Electronic interactions can give rise to novel charge density waves with unconventional ground states. Recent experiments report evidence for a chiral charge density wave (CDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs). Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario. Our work provides unique insights into the ground state of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and introduces a novel method to examine other topological states, such as the fractional Chern insulators, with the STM.</p>

By constructing the ground-state phase diagram and analyzing magnetization, we identify key magnetic phases and critical phenomena. We further quantify quantum correlations using tripartite entanglement negativity and conditional von Neumann entropy to unveil how the Jahn-Teller effect enhances intra-triangle entanglement while modulating inter-triangle correlations. Our findings highlight the Fe$^{3+}_6$ complex as a promising molecular platform for tunable quantum correlations, with potential applications in quantum information processing and molecular qubits.</p>

            <p>Recently discovered, altermagnetism represents a third class of collinear magnets. These materials exhibit zero net magnetization, similar to antiferromagnets, but display anomalous transport properties resembling those of ferromagnets. Altermagnetic materials manifest various anomalous electronic transport phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Nernst effect, and anomalous thermal Hall effect. Additionally, they exhibit magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday effects, previously considered exclusive to ferromagnetic materials. These anomalous transport phenomena are constrained by symmetry, as revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, an effective model-based approach to verify these symmetry constraints remains unavailable. In this Letter, we construct a $k\cdot p$ model for $d$-wave altermagnets CuX$_2$ (X=F,Cl) using spin space group representations and apply it to calculate the anomalous Hall effect. The symmetry-imposed transport properties predicted by the model are in agreement with the DFT results, providing a foundation for further investigation into symmetry-restricted transport phenomena in altermagnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry is a well-established framework for understanding transport and optical responses in quantum materials. In this work, I study the photon drag effect in Dirac electrons using the quantum geometric interpretation of non-vertical optical transitions. Due to the particle-hole symmetry inherent in Dirac electrons, the shift photon-drag photocurrent is dominated by dissipationless Fermi surface contributions, connected to the dipole of quantum metric tensor. I find that this dipole is significantly enhanced by a small band gap in massive Dirac electrons and remains robust in the massless limit. I demonstrate the existence of a circular shift photon-drag current in the effective Hamiltonian at the L-point of bismuth, where the bands exhibit trivial topology, highlighting the ubiquity of the circular photon-drag effect in centrosymmetric materials.</p>

            <p>Silicon quantum dots are one of the most promising candidates for practical quantum computers because of their scalability and compatibility with the well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. However, the coherence time is limited in industry-standard natural silicon because of the $^{29}$Si isotopes, which have non-zero nuclear spin. Here, we protect an isotopically natural silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (Si-MOS) quantum dot spin qubit from environmental noise via electron spin resonance with a phase-modulated microwave (MW) drive. This concatenated continuous drive (CCD) method extends the decay time of Rabi oscillations from 1.2 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ to over 200 $\mathrm{\mu s}$. Furthermore, we define a protected qubit basis and propose robust gate operations. We find the coherence time measured by Ramsey sequence is improved from 143 ns to 40.7 $\mu$s compared to that of the bare spin qubit. The single qubit gate fidelity measured with randomized benchmarking is improved from 95% to 99%, underscoring the effectiveness of the CCD method. The method shows promise for improving control fidelity of noisy qubits, overcoming the qubit variability for global control, and maintaining qubit coherence while idling.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive Floquet-Nambu theory to describe the time-dependent quantum transport in mesoscopic circuits involving superconductors. The central object of our framework is the first-order correlation function, which accounts for the excitations that are generated by a time-dependent voltage and their coherent scattering off the interface with a superconductor. We analyze the time-dependent current generated by periodic voltage pulses and how it depends on the excitation energies of the voltage drive compared to the gap of the superconductor. Our formalism allows us to identify the conditions for the excitations that are scattered off the superconductor to become coherent electron-hole superpositions. To this end, we consider the purity of the outgoing states, which characterizes their ability to carry quantum information. Our framework paves the way for systematic investigations of time-dependent scattering problems involving superconductivity, and it may help interpret future experiments in electron quantum optics with superconductors.</p>

            <p>Dynamic control of topological properties in materials is central to modern condensed matter physics, and Floquet engineering, utilizing periodic light fields, provides a promising avenue. Here, we use Floquet theory to theoretically study the topological response of a Z2 nodal line semimetal (NLSM) when driven by circularly polarized light (CPL). We demonstrate that the direction of CPL irradiation critically dictates the resulting topological phase transitions. Specifically, when light is incident perpendicular to the nodal line plane, increasing the light amplitude induces two successive topological phase transitions: first, from the Z2 NLSM to a vortex NLSM, a rare and intriguing topological state; and second, a transition from the vortex NLSM to a semimetal with a pair of Weyl points (WPs). In stark contrast, irradiation along other directions directly transforms the Z2 nodal line into a pair of WPs. We further investigate the transport properties of the Floquet Z2 NLSM, focusing on the anomalous and planar Hall effects. The anomalous Hall effect exhibits a direction-dependent amplitude variation, deviating from conventional two-band NLSM behavior. Importantly, we reveal a significant and tunable planar Hall effect, a phenomenon largely unexplored in Floquet topological materials, which is highly sensitive to both light amplitude and direction. Our findings not only present a novel route to realize the vortex NLSM, but also establish an efficient way to control Hall transport phenomena in Z2 NLSMs.</p>

These defects create well-understood rheological behavior in passive nematics, but the interplay between colloid-associated defects and spontaneously generated activity-induced defects introduces new dynamical regimes in active nematic turbulence. Using mesoscale simulations, we study the motion of colloids with strong anchoring in an active nematic and find effective colloid diffusivity exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on activity. At low activities, topological kicks from the motile activity-induced bulk defects drive frequent rearrangements of the colloid-associated defects, enhancing colloidal transport. At high activity, defect interactions become isotropic, decorrelating colloidal motion and reducing the effective diffusivity. Our results reveal how the competition between colloid-associated and activity-induced defects fundamentally shapes transport in active nematics.</p>

Magnetic measurements show non-zero but small hysteresis indicating CoRuTiSn as a soft ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of ~200 K. The magnetic moment determined from magnetization data is found to be 0.84 {\mu}B/f.u. at 4 K, which is close to the value, calculated using first principles calculations. Electrical resistivity decreases with temperatures, indicating semiconducting nature of CoRuTiSn. Hall effect measurements show anomalous behavior, consistent with the ferromagnetic nature of the sample.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lan-Ye He, Xin-Man Ye, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>We investigate the sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the first-order perturbation theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</p>

            <p>We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.</p>

            <p>This tutorial provides a joint theoretical and experimental overview of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy, focusing mainly on four-wave mixing (FWM). This powerful and versatile time-resolved nonlinear optical spectroscopy technique enables the investigation of individual localized single photon emitters, as well as microscopy of extended samples, e.g., two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. Starting with the fundamental theory of optically driven two-level systems, we motivate the utility of wave mixing spectroscopy via a discussion on homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths which can be independently measured using FWM. We then provide a detailed overview of the heterodyne wave mixing setup operated by one of the authors (JK) at Institut Néel in Grenoble, supported by theoretical modeling of the signal detection process. Throughout the paper we elaborate on important benefits of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy, e.g., background-free detection, measurement of the full signal field including amplitude and phase, and investigation of coupling mechanisms in few-level systems. Within the context of the latter point we discuss the significance of two-dimensional (2D) FWM spectra. This tutorial is dedicated to students, young researchers, as well as experts in the field of nonlinear spectroscopy in general and FWM in particular. It explains the fundamental concepts and building blocks required to operate a heterodyne wave mixing experiment both from the experimental and theoretical side. This joint approach is helpful for theoreticians who want to accurately and quantitatively model wave mixing signals, as well as for experimentalists who aim to interpret their recorded data.</p>

            <h2>Vibrational Instabilities in Charge Transport through Molecular Nanojunctions: The Role of Nonconservative Current-Induced Electronic Forces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin Mäck, Riley J. Preston, Michael Thoss, Samuel L. Rudge</p>
            <p>Understanding the current-induced vibrational dynamics in molecular nanojunctions is critical for gaining insight into the stability of such systems. While it is well known that Joule heating at higher bias voltages plays an important role for the stability of the nanojunction, a different mechanism caused by current-induced nonconservative forces has been reported to cause vibrational instabilities already at much lower voltages. In this paper, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to a model system for which vibrational instabilities have previously been reported. The electronic friction and other electronic forces can be calculated exactly using nonequilibrium Green's functions. We perform Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics to calculate the steady-state vibrational excitation and compare the results to a simplified eigenmode analysis, identifying the parameter regimes in which runaway modes appear.</p>

            <h2>Single-band Triangular Lattice Hubbard Model with Tunable Anisotropy from Twisted Diamond Homobilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Sun, Chuyi Tuo, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>The ground-state properties of the single-band triangular lattice Hubbard model with hopping anisotropy and strong interactions remain elusive so far. Here we show that twisted diamond homobilayers with band extrema at $Y$ valley can realize weakly-coupled chains with quasi-1D band structure; applying displacement field generates interchain hopping, transforming this quasi-1D system into a 2D one. The low-energy physics can be described by localized Wannier functions on the triangular lattice with tunable hopping anisotropy, providing a promising platform for studying the anisotropic triangular lattice Hubbard model. We further employ density matrix renormalization group to study this model with interaction $U=10t$ and anisotropy $0.5\leq t'/t\leq 1.5$ at half filling, and obtain a rich ground state phase diagram, including a chiral spin liquid phase, non-magnetic phases, and a Néel antiferromagnetic phase. This work provides a first realization of displacement-field tuned anisotropy in a single-band triangular Hubbard model within moiré systems, establishing them as a promising platform to investigate intriguing correlated physics with tunable anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of distinct exact mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchayan Banerjee, Soumya Ranjan Padhi, Tapan Mishra</p>
            <p>Mobility edges (MEs) constitute the energies separating the localized states from the extended ones in disordered systems. Going beyond this conventional definition, recent proposal suggests for an ME which separates the localized and multifractal states in certain quasiperiodic systems - dubbed as the anomalous mobility edges (AMEs). In this study, we propose an exactly solvable quasiperiodic system that hosts both the conventional and anomalous mobility edges under proper conditions. We show that with increase in quasiperiodic disorder strength, the system first undergoes a delocalization to localization transition through an ME of conventional type. Surprisingly, with further increase in disorder, we obtain that a major fraction of the localized states at the middle of the spectrum turn multifractal in nature. Such unconventional behavior in the spectrum results in two AMEs, which continue to exist even for stronger quasiperiodic disorder. We numerically obtain the signatures of the coexisting MEs complement it through analytical derivation using Avila's global theory. In the end we provide important signatures from the wavepacket dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuldeep Ray, Jérémie Vigier, Perrine Usé, Sylvain Martin, Nicolas Lefoulon, Chloé Bouard, Marc Drouard, Gilles Gaudin</p>
            <p>The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</p>

            <p>Metamaterials, renowned for their exceptional mechanical, electromagnetic, and thermal properties, hold transformative potential across diverse applications, yet their design remains constrained by labor-intensive trial-and-error methods and limited data interoperability. Here, we introduce CrossMatAgent--a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents--each specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt engineering, and supervisory feedback--our system leverages the multimodal reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmological production of Dirac fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Fulgado-Claudio, Alejandro Bermudez</p>
            <p>Although gravitational particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of gravitational particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of gravitational particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of fermion condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics. We use the entanglement contour as a tool to analyze the spatio-temporal causal structure of particle production, showing how it can account for the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifest through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement in this analogue cQFT.</p>

            <h2>Light's symmetry, asymmetry, and their role in nonlinear optics and ultrafast phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ofer Neufeld, Matan Even Tzur, Ofer Kfir, Avner Fleischer, Oren Cohen</p>
            <p>The analysis of symmetries is extremely useful across science. In Physics, symmetries are used to derive conservation laws and selection rules for transitions in interacting systems. In the early days of nonlinear optics (NLO), symmetries were used to formulate a set of rules for photonic processes according to the medium's symmetries that are reflected in the NLO coefficient tensor. While this approach was believed to be complete and closed, the field has recently reignited as multi-color ultrashort laser pulses with tailored polarization and spatiotemporal structures become standard in NLO. A more complete theory has been recently emerging, which aims to incorporate all possible dynamical degrees of freedom of light: spin and orbital angular momentum, spatial structure, time-dependent polarizations, temporal envelopes, etc., in addition to the symmetries of the medium. This theoretical development is also accompanied by experimental advances that rely on tailored light beams that can now be generated with ever-increasing complexity, including topologies in real and a variety of synthetic dimensions, carrying poly-chromatic carrier waves, time-dependent varying angular momenta, local-chirality, and more. The nonlinear interactions between light fields with unique symmetries (or asymmetries) and matter is especially appealing, since that holds the key for developing new ultrafast spectroscopies with sub-femtosecond resolution, for exerting exact control over matter, and improving our fundamental understanding of how light and matter interact. We review these recent advances in this expanding field, focusing on the theory, its implications, and seminal experiments. We aim to establish a comprehensive database of symmetries and selection rules governing NLO light-matter interactions within the emerging new formalism, and invite the scientific community to contribute to this effort.</p>

            <h2>Axisymmetric thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows for microfluidics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weida Liao, Eric Lauga</p>
            <p>Recent microfluidic experiments have explored the precise positioning of micron-sized particles in liquid environments via laser-induced thermoviscous flow. From micro-robotics to biology at the subcellular scale, this versatile technique has found a broad range of applications. Through the interplay between thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes, the repeated scanning of the laser along a scan path results in fluid flow and hence net transport of particles, without physical channels. Building on previous work focusing on two-dimensional microfluidic settings, we present an analytical, theoretical model for the thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows and net transport induced by a translating heat spot in three-dimensional, unconfined fluid. We first numerically solve for the temperature field due to a translating heat source in the experimentally relevant limit. Then, in our flow model, the small, localised temperature increase causes local changes in the mass density, shear viscosity and bulk viscosity of the fluid. We derive analytically the instantaneous flow generated during one scan and compute the net transport of passive tracers due to a full scan, up to quadratic order in the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. We further show that the flow and transport are independent of bulk viscosity. In the far field, while the leading-order instantaneous flow is typically a three-dimensional source or sink, the leading-order average velocity of tracers is instead a source dipole, whose strength depends on the relative magnitudes of the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. Our quantitative results reveal the potential for future three-dimensional net transport and manipulation of particles at the microscale.</p>

            <p>Strong interaction between electrons in two-dimensional systems in the presence of a high magnetic field gives rise to fractional quantum Hall states that host quasiparticles with fractional charge and fractional exchange statistics. Here, we demonstrate high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of fractional quantum Hall states in ultra clean Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices. Spectroscopy measurements show sharp excitations that have been predicted to emerge when electrons fractionalize into bound states of quasiparticles. We find energy gaps for candidate non-abelian fractional states that are larger by a factor of five than other related systems - for example semiconductor heterostructures - and this suggests bilayer graphene is an ideal platform for the manipulation of these quasiparticles and for the creation of a topological quantum bit. We also find previously unobserved fractional states in our very clean graphene samples.</p>

            <p>Using first-principle calculations, we investigate the electronic, topological and superconducting properties of Nb$_3$X (X = Ge, Sn, Sb) and Ta$_3$Y (Y = As, Sb, Bi) A15 compounds. We demonstrate that these compounds host Dirac surface states which are related to a nontrivial Z$_2$ topological value. The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) splits the eightfold degenerate R point close to the Fermi level enhancing the amplitude of the spin Hall conductance. Indeed, despite the moderate spin-orbit of the Nb-compounds, a large spin Hall effect is also obtained in Nb$_3$Ge and Nb$_3$Sn compounds. We show that the Coulomb interaction opens the gap at the R point thus making more evident the occurrence of Dirac surface states. We then investigate the superconducting properties by determining the strength of the electron-phonon BCS coupling. The evolution of the critical temperature is tracked down to the 2D limit indicating a reduction of the transition temperature which mainly arises from the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. Finally, we propose a minimal tight-binding model based on three coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with t$_{2g}$ Ta- and Nb-orbitals reproducing the spin-orbit splittings at the R point among the $\pi$-bond bands in this class of compounds. We separate the kinetic parameters in $\pi$ and $\delta$-bonds, in intradimer and interdimer hoppings and discuss their relevance for the topological electronic structure. We point out that Nb$_3$Ge might represent a Z$_2$ topological metal with the highest superconducting temperature ever recorded.</p>

            <h2>Light-induced charge and spin Hall currents in materials with $C_4K$ symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tohid Farajollahpour, R. Ganesh, Kirill Samokhin</p>
            <p>Berry curvature, a momentum space property, can manifest itself in current responses. The well-known anomalous Hall effect in time-reversal-breaking systems arises from a Berry curvature monopole. In time-reversal-invariant materials, a second-order Hall conductivity emerges from a Berry curvature dipole. Recently, it has been shown that a Berry curvature quadrupole induces a third-order ac Hall response in systems that break time reversal ($K$) and a fourfold rotational ($C_{4}$) symmetry, while remaining invariant under the combination of the two ($C_{4}K$). In this letter, we demonstrate that incident light can induce a $\rm dc$ Hall current in such systems, driven by the Berry curvature quadrupole. We consider a combination of a static $\rm dc$ electric field and an ac light-induced electric field. We calculate the current perpendicular to both the static electric field and the fourfold axis. Remarkably, the induced current is generically spin-polarized. A net charge current appears for light that is linearly or elliptically polarized, but not for circular polarization. In contrast, the spin current remains unchanged when the polarization of light is varied. This allows for rich possibilities such as generating a spin current by shining circularly polarized light on an altermagnetic material. We demonstrate this physics using a two-dimensional toy model for altermagnets.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metric-induced Oscillations in Flat Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Zeng, Zijian Zhou, Wenhui Duan, Huaqing Huang</p>
            <p>The transport of Bloch electrons under strong fields is traditionally understood through two mechanisms: intraband Bloch oscillations and interband Zener tunneling. Here, we propose an oscillation mechanism induced by the interband quantum metric, which would significantly affect the electron dynamics under strong fields. By considering the multiband dynamics to the second order of the density matrix, we reveal that quantum metric induced oscillations (QMOs) persist regardless of band dispersion, even in exactly dispersionless flat bands. The resultant drift current can reach a magnitude comparable to the Bloch oscillation induced drift current in systems where interband tunneling is negligible. Notably, the QMO induced drift current increases linearly with electric field strength under the constraints of time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetry, emerging as the primary delocalized current. We further show that both one-dimensional and two-dimensional superlattices are potential platforms for investigating QMO.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Rana, David T. Limmer</p>
            <p>We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.</p>

            <p>We derive a version of the so-called "best Fokker-Planck approximation" (BFPA) to describe the spatial properties of interacting active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) in arbitrary spatial dimensions. In doing so, we also take into account the odd-diffusive contribution of the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a spatially dependent magnetic field, sticking to the overdamped limit. While the BFPA itself does not turn out to be widely useful, our general approach allows to deduce an appropriate generalization of the Fox approximation, which we use to characterize the stationary behavior of a single active particle in an external potential by deriving analytic expressions for configurational probability distributions (or effective potentials). In agreement with computer simulations, our theory predicts that the Lorentz force reduces the effective attraction and thus the probability to find an active particle in the vicinity of a repulsive wall. Even for an inhomogeneous magnetic field, our theoretical findings provide useful qualitative insights, specifically regarding the location of accumulation regions.</p>

            <p>The collective diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a key quantity for describing the macroscopic transport properties of soft matter systems. However, measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a fundamental experimental and numerical challenge, as it either relies on nonequilibrium techniques that are hard to interpret or, at equilibrium, on Fourier-based approaches which are fraught with difficulties associated with Fourier transforms. In this work, we investigate the equilibrium diffusive dynamics of a 2D colloidal suspension experimentally and numerically. We use a "Countoscope" technique, which analyses the statistics of particle number counts $N(t)$ in virtual observation boxes of a series of microscopy images at equilibrium, to measure $D_\mathrm{coll}$ for the first time. We validate our results against Fourier-based approaches and establish best practices for measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ using fluctuating counts. We show that Fourier techniques yield inaccurate long-range collective measurements because of the non-periodic nature of an experimental image, yet counting exploits this property by using finite observation windows. Finally, we discuss the potential of our method to advance our understanding of collective properties in suspensions, particularly the role of hydrodynamic interactions.</p>

We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks using different activities. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force.

            <p>Fibre-reinforced hydrogels are promising materials for biomedical applications due to their strength, toughness, and tunability. However, it remains unclear how to design fibre-reinforced hydrogels for use in specific applications due to the lack of a flexible modelling framework that can predict and hence optimise their behaviour. In this paper, we present a microstructural model for transversely isotropic fibre-reinforced hydrogels that captures the specific geometry of the fibre network. The model also accounts for slack in the initial fibre network that is gradually removed upon deformation. The mechanical model for the fibre network is coupled to a nonlinear poroelastic model for the hydrogel matrix that accounts for osmotic stress. By comparing the model predictions to data from unconfined compression experiments, we show that the model can capture J-shaped stress-strain curves and time-dependent creep responses. We showcase how the model can be used to guide the design of materials for artificial cartilage by exploring how to maximise interstitial fluid pressure. We find that fluid pressurisation can be increased by using stiffer fibres, removing slack from the fibre network, and reducing the Young's modulus of the hydrogel matrix. Finally, a high-level and open-source Python package has been developed for simulating unconfined compression experiments using the model.</p>

Recent advances in 3D nanofabrication now offer possibilities for tuning functional properties relevant for on-chip 3D integration of superconductors. However, non-equilibrium phenomena in 3D nanostructures exposed to transport currents remain largeley unexplored. Here, we employ numerical simulations to investigate phase slips -- discrete $2\pi$ jumps in the phase of the superconducting order parameter -- in a tubular Nb superconductor with a central constriction, which is subjected to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) transport currents. We find that under DC drive, the system stabilizes periodic phase slips, resulting in GHz voltage oscillations. Introducing an additional AC frequency modulation generates microwave frequency combs which depend characteristically on the interaction between moving vortices and phase slips. Our findings open avenues for developing on-chip frequency comb generators in 3D cryoelectronics.</p>

Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.</p>

When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \mathcal{D}^t \zeta \mathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to pseudo-orthogonal group. These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Fritzsch, Maximilian F. I. Kieler, Arnd Bäcker</p>
            <p>While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</p>

            <h2>First- and second-order quantum phase transitions in the long-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Víctor Herráiz-López, Sebastián Roca-Jerat, Manuel Gallego, Ramón Ferrández, Jesús Carrete, David Zueco, Juan Román-Roche</p>
            <p>We study the ground-state phase diagram of an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields in the full range of interactions: from all-to-all to nearest-neighbors. First, we solve the model analytically in the strong long-range regime, confirming in the process that a mean-field treatment is exact for this model. We compute the order parameter and the correlations and show that the model exhibits a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from first to second order. This is in contrast with the nearest-neighbor limit where the phase transition is known to be second order. To understand how the order of the phase transition changes from one limit to the other, we tackle the analytically-intractable interaction ranges numerically, using a variational quantum Monte Carlo method with a neural-network-based ansatz, the visual transformer. We show how the first-order phase transition shrinks with decreasing interaction range and establish approximate boundaries in the interaction range for which the first-order phase transition is present. Finally, we establish that the key ingredient to stabilize a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point is the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between spins of the same sublattice on top of antiferromagnetic interactions between spins of different sublattices. Tunable-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions are just one way to implement such staggered interactions.</p>

            <h2>A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liyuan Chen, Yuanjie Ren, Ruihua Fan, Arthur Jaffe</p>
            <p>One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan R. Deop-Ruano, Alejandro Manjavacas</p>
            <p>Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.</p>

            <p>Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can rigorously determine these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, highlighting a novel generalized mechanism discovered in this experiment and shown with rigorous theory. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</p>

            <p>H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.</p>

            <h2>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz</p>
            <p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p>

            <p>Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling. We also study the gate fidelity of a two-qubit gate for a universal gate set and discuss future developments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Townsend, Joshua Pomeroy, Garnett W. Bryant</p>
            <p>We show that resonant driving between the spin up and spin down states of an electron spin-qubit in a quantum dot reduces the occupancy of the dot through leakage to an appropriately tuned lead. A nearby charge sensor measuring the occupancy of the dot should be able to detect the narrow resonant condition upon sweeping the driving frequency. The presence of interactions with noisy and thermal environments such as leads are an inherent part of creating and manipulating quantum information processing systems. This work is an example of how to incorporate methods from the ``open quantum systems'' perspective into descriptions of quantum devices. The method used here captures the coherent dynamics of the Rabi driving on the spin state of an electron tunneling into a lead, and yields full equations of motion for the interaction-picture density matrix with on- or off-resonance driving</p>

            <p>As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.</p>

            <h2>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Quade, Michael Potthoff</p>
            <p>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by $2\pi$ rotations of the phase $\phi$ of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces $\ca H_{0}(\phi)$ based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective $\sigma_{x}$-gate and a projective $\sigma_{z}$-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.</p>

            <h2>Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2</h2>

Séamus Davis, Qiangqiang Gu</p>
            <p>Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.</p>

We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p>

            <p>Due to the dominant Kitaev exchange interactions, the cobaltate, Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$, has been considered to be approximate to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). Here, we investigate both magnetic dilution and chemical pressure effects of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$ by the substitutions of Mg$^{2+}$ for Co$^{2+}$ through the structural, optical, magnetic and thermodynamic measurements. No structural transition has been observed, and the bandgaps remain constant in all doping levels. Combining with the magnetic and thermodynamic measurements, we find that the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is continuously suppressed with increasing Mg doping levels and completely disappears at $x=0.2$. Interestingly, when the doping level $x$ is larger than 0.2, neither long-range magnetic order nor spin glass state has been detected, and the specific heat has a residual linear term at zero field. All features indicate that Na$_{3}$(Co$_{2-x}$Mg$_{x}$)SbO$_{6}$ system enters into a novel spin disorder (NSD) state.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small c-axis parameter of 3.26 Å and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. We observe distinct magnetotransport behaviors in europium-containing samples, including negative magnetoresistance and field-enhanced superconductivity. By establishing a clear correlation between decreasing c-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems, these findings establish clear materials design principles for achieving higher transition temperatures in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</p>

            <p>We propose a theoretical model describing a Josephson junction featuring a magnetically textured barrier within two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both $p_x + p_y$ and $p_x + ip_y$ type pairing symmetries. Our study reveals the influence of the magnetic barrier strength and its spatial periodicity on the system's topological properties, in terms of local density of states and Josephson current calculations. Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Animesh Hazra, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Anirban Mukherjee, Punyabrata Pradhan</p>
            <p>We show that lattice models in $d>1$ dimensions with mass-conserving and multidirectional hopping dynamics exhibit power-law correlations for generic parameter values, even {\it far} from phase transition point (if any). The key idea for generating the algebraic decay is the notion of {\it multidirectional} hopping, which means that several chunks of masses, or several particles, can hop out simultaneously from a lattice site in multiple directions, consequently breaking detailed balance. Notably, the systems are described by continuous-time Markov jump processes, are diffusive, {\it lattice-rotation symmetric}, spatially homogeneous and thus have {\it no} net mass current. Using hydrodynamic and exact microscopic theory, we show that, in dimensions $d > 1$, the steady-state static density-density and ``activity''-density correlations in the thermodynamic limit decay {\it universally} as $\sim 1/r^{(d+2)}$ at large distance $r=|{\bf r}|$; the strength of the power law is exactly calculated for several models and expressed in terms of the bulk-diffusion coefficient and mobility tensor. In particular, our theory explains why center-of-mass-conserving dynamics, used to model disordered {\it hyperuniform} state of matter, should result in generic long-ranged correlations in the systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-geun Oh, Sun-Woo Kim, Kun Woo Kim, Bartomeu Monserrat, Jun-Won Rhim</p>
            <p>Exploring the quantum geometric properties of solids beyond their topological aspects has become a key focus in current solid-state physics research. We derive the geometric formula for optical conductivity from the quantum metric tensor, applicable to the low-energy regime. This general formulation also depends on the detailed shape of the band dispersion in addition to the geometric properties of the Bloch wave function. We demonstrate, however, that for quadratic band-touching (QBT) semimetals, the optical conductivity simplifies to $\sigma = (e^2/8\hbar)d^2_\mathrm{max}$ when the light frequency exceeds a critical threshold, where $d_\mathrm{max}$ represents the maximum Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance around the band-crossing point. This result indicates that the optical conductivity of QBT semimetals is universal and determined entirely by quantum geometry, independent of other details of the band structure. Furthermore, under time-reversal and rotational symmetries, $d_\mathrm{max}$ is restricted to discrete values of 0 or 1, leading to a quantized universal optical conductivity. Through first-principles calculations, we show that our findings are applicable to real materials, including bilayer graphene, Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$, and other realistic material candidates. Our work underscores the critical role of quantum geometry in governing optical properties, which can be probed through standard optical methods.</p>

We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the time-dependent many-body system, can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two-particle processes derived from the quantum integrable system. This geometric characterization provides a powerful lens for analyzing dynamical transitions in driven many-body settings. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze a prototypical time-dependent Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined, where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhbits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. When the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Finite-Temperature Behavior of Rydberg Atom Arrays: A Tensor Network Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhou Han, Hao Zhang, Lixin He</p>
            <p>Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for experimental research and a challenging subject for theoretical investigation in quantum science. In this study, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of two-dimensional square-lattice Rydberg atom arrays using the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) method. By analyzing the thermal behavior of systems in the checkerboard and striated phases, we extract critical exponents and identify phase transition characteristics. Our results confirm that the checkerboard phase transition belongs to the 2D Ising universality class, while the striated phase exhibits critical exponents that deviate from known universality classes, possibly due to finite-size effects. These findings provide theoretical insights into the thermal stability of quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays and offer valuable guidance for future experimental efforts.</p>

            <p>Low-dimensional spin fluctuations play a crucial role in unconventional superconductors, with quasi-one-dimensional spin excitations potentially linked with spin-triplet superconductivity. The heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_2$ exhibits an unusual large inverted S-shaped upper critical field that suggests a possible triplet pairing state within its pressure-induced superconducting dome. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we discover quasi-one-dimensional magnetic excitations in CeSb$_2$ emerging from nearly square Ce layers with minor orthorhombic deformation. We show that the data are well described by a ferromagnetic spin ladder model, where the "rungs" of the ladder straddle Ce bilayers. Moreover, we find that diffuse excitations akin to those in the ordered phase persist well above $T_{\rm N}$, suggesting that quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnetic paramagnons may significantly contribute to the unusual superconductivity that appears under pressure once magnetic order is suppressed.</p>

            <h2>Molecular Insights into the Crystallization of 4'-Hydroxyacetophenone from Water: Solute Aggregation, Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Polymorph Selection</h2>

            <p>In this work insights into the structural rearrangements occurring in aqueous solution, prior to the nucleation of different 4'-hydroxyacetophenone (HAP) forms from water were obtained, through a combination of thermomicroscopy, micro-differential scanning calorimetry, density and speed of sound measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results confirmed our previous observation that cooling crystallization of HAP is intermediated by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and, depending on the initially selected concentration range, selectively leads to the formation of different crystal forms. Analysis of the solution properties before the onset of LLPS revealed that, in the HAP mole fraction range xHAP \< 0.004 (Zone I), where hydrate H2 ultimately crystallizes, small, solvated clusters are initially present in solution, which remain approximately invariant in size, shape and HAP/H2O proportion as the temperature decreases. For the xHAP \&gt; 0.005 range (Zone III), where anhydrous form I crystallizes, large HAP/water aggregates (that can even percolate the whole system as xHAP approaches the 0.005 limit) are already initially present in solution. As cooling progresses, they become more compact, a process accompanied by a reduction in water content, and which is more significant as the solution concentration increases. The 0.004 \< xHAP \< 0.005 (Zone II) range corresponds to a transition region where, as xHAP increases, the physical properties of the solution initially evolve from those typical of Zone I and, at a certain point, abruptly change and start converging to those typical of Zone III. In all zones, the colloidal particles formed upon LLPS (from which crystallization results) can also reduce their water content on cooling, but the extent of this process increases as xHAP moves from Zones I and II, where hydrates are formed, to Zone III, where anhydrous Form I is produced.</p>

            <p>The two-dimensional triangular lattice (TAL) is a model system of magnetic frustration and competing interactions, where skyrmion spin vortices can be induced by a vertical magnetic field $B$. We target the binary compound GdGa$_2$ with an undistorted TAL of Gd$^{3+}$ Heisenberg moments. At higher temperature ($T > 5$ K, $B = 0$, phase II), we reveal the cycloidal spin textures in GdGa$_2$ via resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS). Further, a transition with strong magneto-elastic response occurs when cooling into the zero-field ground state ($T < 5$ K, phase I). We also report the thermodynamic phase boundaries of $B$-induced magnetic A-phases, which are suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field and which have enhanced resistivity due to the partial opening of a charge gap. In analogy to Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, these phases may represent a superposition of various cycloids, possibly a Néel skyrmion lattice. Our work lays the basis for further studies of the magnetic phase diagram of GdGa$_2$.</p>

            <p>Radiation-induced crystal lattice damage and its recovery in wide bandgap oxides, in particular beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3), is a complex process. This paper presents the first study on the process of the defects accumulation in beta-Ga2O3 implanted with Rare Earth (RE) ions and the impact of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) on the defects formed. (-201) oriented beta-Ga2O3 single crystals were implanted with Yb ions fluences ranging from 1 x 1012 to 5 x 1015 at/cm2. Channeling Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS/c) was used to study the crystal lattice damage induced by ion implantation and the level of structure recovery after annealing. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of collected spectra were performed by computer simulations. The resulting accumulation curve reveals a two-step damage process. In the first stage, the damage of the beta-Ga2O3 is inconspicuous, but begins to grow rapidly from the fluence of 1 x 1013 at/cm2, reaching the saturation at the random level for the Yb ion fluence of 1 x 1014 at/cm2. Further irradiation causes the damage peak to become bimodal, indicating that at least two new defect forms develop for the higher ion fluence. These two damage zones differently react to annealing, suggesting that they could origin from two phases, the amorphization phase and the new crystalline phase of Ga2O3.</p>

            <p>New mechanochemical preparations of three multicomponent crystals (MCCs) of the form MCl:urea.nH2O (M = Li+, Na+, and Cs+) are reported. Their structures were determined by an NMR crystallography approach, combining Rietveld refinement of synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD), multinuclear (35Cl, 7Li, 23Na, and 133Cs) solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. Mechanochemical syntheses of the three MCCs, two of which are novel, are optimized for maximum yield and efficiency. 35Cl SSNMR is well-suited for the structural characterization of these MCCs since it is sensitive to subtle differences and/or changes in chloride ion environments, providing a powerful means of examining H...Cl-bonding environments. Alkali metal NMR is beneficial for identifying the number of unique magnetically and crystallographically distinct sites and enables facile detection of educts and/or impurities. In the case of NaCl:urea.H2O, 23Na MAS NMR spectra are key, both for identifying residual NaCl educt and for monitoring NaCl:urea.H2O degradation, which appears to proceed via an autocatalytic decomposition process driven by water (with a rate constant of k = 1.22x10-3 s-1). SSNMR and PXRD were used to inform the initial structural models. Following Rietveld refinement, the models were subjected to dispersion-corrected plane-wave DFT geometry optimizations and subsequent calculations of the 35Cl EFG tensors, which enable the refinement of hydrogen atom positions, as well as the exploration of their relationships to the local hydrogen bonding environments of the chloride ions and crystallographic symmetry elements.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical properties of liquid and supercooled liquid silicon, modeled using the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential, to examine the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation. Towards this end, we examine the relationship among various dynamical quantities, including (i) the macroscopic transport coefficients - self diffusion coefficient $D$ and viscosity $\eta$, (ii) relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$ as well as (iii) lengthscale dependent relaxation times $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ over a broad range of temperature $T$, pressure $P$ and density $\rho$ covering both equilibrium and metastable liquid state points in the phase diagram. Our study shows a weak break down in SE relation involving $D$ and $\eta$, and the loci of \Revision{the breakdown of the SE relation} (SEB) is found in the high T liquid phase. The $\tau_{\alpha}$, when used as a proxy to $\eta$, shows distinct breakdown in the SE relation whose loci is found in the supercooled liquid phase. Interestingly, certain parts of the phase diagram shows that loci of onset of slow dynamics lie below the loci of SEB, suggesting a regime that exhibits Arrhenius but non-Fickian behaviour. Computation of $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ enables us to extract the lengthscale associated with the Fickian to non-Fickian behaviour using which we show that the \Revision{breakdown of the SE relation} occurs only below a specific lengthscale at a given temperature. Further we also compare the SEB loci with other features of the phase behaviour, including the loci of compressiblity maximum, density maximum as well as diffusivity maximum.</p>

            <p>Excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (1L-TMD) are highly bound states characterized by a Rydberg-like spectrum of discrete energy levels. Within this spectrum, states with odd-parity are known as dark excitons because transitions to the ground state are forbidden by selection rules. This makes their stationary and transient characterization challenging using linear optical techniques. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of a 2p dark excitonic state in 1L-WS$_2$ can be directly retrieved by measuring the Autler-Townes splitting of bright states in a three-pulse experiment. The splitting of the bright 1s excitonic state, observed by detuning a mid-infrared control field across the 1s-2p transition, provides an accurate characterization of the 2p state, which is used here to reveal its dynamics following a sudden photoinjection of free carriers in the conduction band. We observe a qualitatively different dynamics of the 1s and 2p levels, which is indicative of symmetry-dependent screening and exciton-exciton interactions. These findings provide new insights into many-body effects in TMDs, offering potential avenues for advancing the next generation optoelectronics.</p>

            <p>We study the orientational ordering and close packing behavior of a quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) hard superellipse system in which centers of particles are restricted to a line while they can rotate freely in a two-dimensional plane. Through the aspect ratio (k), the elongation of the particles and through the deformation parameter (n), the shape can be tuned between ellipses and rectangles. Maxima in the pressure ratio (P/Phd) (where P and Phd are the pressure of hard superellipses and that of q1D hard disks) are a good indicator for the continuous structural change from isotropic to nematic order. This change occurs at higher densities than the sharp nematic transitions of corresponding two-dimensional and three-dimensional hard body systems. Additionally, suitable close packing exponents describing the close-packing limit show universality in that they depending only on n and certain combinations are independent of both k and n.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical instabilities of an ultracold Bose-Bose mixture with long-range dipole-dipole interactions, trapped in deep optical lattices and subject to periodically varying contact interaction. The effect of beyond-mean-field corrections due to quantum fluctuations is considered. In the tight-binding regime, we employ Wannier functions to derive a discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation that captures the dynamics of the system. Using linear stability analysis coupled to multiple scale expansion, we systematically study the modulational and parametric instabilities of the system, identifying the conditions under which these instabilities emerge. The corresponding instability domains are found and examined. The roles of long-range interactions and quantum fluctuations are highlighted, demonstrating their significant impact on the stability and dynamics of the lattice system. Our analytical predictions are validated through direct numerical simulations, which confirm the instability diagrams through the effective onset of instabilities and reveal the intricate interplay between interaction strength, quantum fluctuation, and the long-range nature of the dipole-dipole forces. This work provides insights into the control and manipulation of ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices, which have potential applications in quantum simulation and condensed matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Linear statistics at the microscopic scale for the 2D Coulomb gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Le Doussal, Gregory Schehr</p>
            <p>We consider the classical Coulomb gas in two dimensions at the inverse temperature $\beta=2$, confined within a droplet of radius $R$ by a rotationally invariant potential $U(r)$. For $U(r)\sim r^2$ this describes the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre ensemble of random matrices. We study linear statistics of the form ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(|{\bf x}_i|)$, where ${\bf x}_i$'s are the positions of the $N$ particles, in the large $N$ limit with $R=O(1)$. It is known that for smooth functions $f(r)$ the variance ${\rm Var} \,{\cal L}_N= O(1)$, while for an indicator function relevant for the disk counting statistics, all cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 2$ behave as $\sim \sqrt{N}$. In addition, for smooth functions, it was shown that the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 3$ scale as $\sim N^{2-q}$. Surprisingly it was found that they depend only on $f'(|\bf x|)$ and its derivatives evaluated exactly at the boundary of the droplet. To understand this property, and interpolate between the two behaviors (smooth versus step-like), we study the microscopic linear statistics given by $f(r) \to f_N(r) = \phi((r-\hat r) \sqrt{N}/\xi)$, which probes the fluctuations at the scale of the inter-particle distance. We compute the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ at large $N$ for a fixed $\phi(u)$ at arbitrary $\xi$. For large $\xi$ they match the predictions for smooth functions which shows that the leading contribution in that case comes from a boundary layer of size $1/\sqrt{N}$ near the boundary of the droplet. Finally we show that the full probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$ take two distinct large deviation forms, in the regime ${\cal L}_N \sim \sqrt{N}$ and ${\cal L}_N \sim N$ respectively. We also discuss applications of our results to fermions in a rotating harmonic trap and to the Ginibre symplectic ensemble.</p>

            <p>A transformation between the magnetically ordered CeCoGe$_3$ and heavy fermion CeFeGe$_3$ is isostructural but not isoelectronic, therefore the characterization of the electronic structure of the CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ series is of special importance. We report both the experimental investigation by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the first-principles calculations within the full-potential local-orbital (FPLO) scheme based on the density functional theory. Experimentally, we investigate mainly the valence band and the Ce $3d$ spectra, both giving the possibility to conclude about the level of the $f$ states localization. Computationally, we investigate the most characteristic CeCoGe$_3$, CeCo$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ge$_3$, and CeFeGe$_3$ compositions. Based on the electronic band structure results, we calculate the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the valence band. We consider the effects of the spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic Hubbard U repulsion. Furthermore, we discuss the charge distribution and occupation of valence-band orbitals. The experimentally observed evolution of the 3$d$ band with the Fe concentration is related to the decrease of the number of electrons and reduction of the 3$d$ photoionization cross-sections. Calculations indicate that charge is transferred mainly from the Ce to Ge sites and the bondings are formed mainly by the Ce 5$d$, Fe/Co 3$d$, and Ge 4$p$ and 4$s$ orbitals.</p>

            <p>Skyrmion formation in centrosymmetric magnets without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions was originally predicted from unbiased numerical techniques. However, no attempt has yet been made, by comparison to a real material, to determine the salient interaction terms and model parameters driving spin-vortex formation. We identify a Hamiltonian with anisotropic exchange couplings, local ion anisotropy, and four-spin interactions, which is generally applicable to this class of compounds. In the representative system Gd3Ru4Al12, anisotropic exchange drives a fragile balance between helical, skyrmion lattice, and transverse conical (cycloidal) orders. The model is severely constrained by the experimentally observed collapse of the SkL with a small in-plane magnetic field. For the zero-field helical state, we further anticipate that spins can be easily rotated out of the spiral plane by a tilted magnetic field or applied current.</p>

            <h2>Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Gebhard, Kevin Bauerbach, Örs Legeza</p>
            <p>We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.</p>

The framework provides fundamental insights into complex magnetic orders recently observed in materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, where the interplay between geometric frustration and multiple ordering vectors leads to exotic magnetic states. Our results establish clear connections between microscopic interactions, broken symmetries, and experimentally observable properties, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting novel magnetic phases in frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals ferromagnets, such as Fe5GeTe2, offer a promising platform for spintronic devices based on chiral magnetic textures, provided a significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) can be induced to stabilise them. Here, we directly measure DMI in epitaxial Fe5GeTe2 thin films using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and observe a consistent DMI (D = 0.04 mJ/m2) across various thicknesses. Its weak thickness dependence, combined with the nominally symmetric film interfaces, suggests a bulk origin. Although we do not determine the microscopic mechanism, our findings are compatible with ab-initio calculations linking DMI to partial ordering of Fe split sites. Additionally, we find a low magnetic dissipation (alpha < 0.003). The observed DMI, which could be further enhanced by optimising the Fe site ordering, combined with low dissipation, makes Fe5GeTe2 a strong candidate for exploring the dynamics of chiral magnetic textures in two-dimensional materials.</p>

For the model with three-spin couplings we calculate the critical point and demonstrate that the phase transition is controlled by an infinite disorder fixed point. We have determined the typical correlation-length critical exponent, which seems to be different from that of the random transverse Ising chain with nearest-neighbor couplings. Thus this model represents a new infinite disorder universality class.</p>

            <p>We utilized high-pressure methods to synthesize the oxides AReO$4$ (A=Zn, Mg) and characterized their crystal structures as monoclinic wolframite-type. By combining muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu^+$SR) with DFT calculations for muon stopping sites, we identify two possible magnetic spin structures for both compounds: $\Gamma_3$ with the propagation vector $\mathbf{k} = (0,1/2,0)$ and $\Gamma_4$ with $\mathbf{k} = (0,0,0)$. In both cases, the magnetic moments are canted from the principal axes within the $ac$-plane. The ordered moment of the proposed structures is $\mathbf{0.29(5)~\mu\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_3$ and $\mathbf{0.25(8)~\mu_\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_4$. The low moment is consistent with the absence of a magnetic contribution to the neutron powder diffraction (NPD) spectra. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis supports the oxidation state of Re being Re$^{6+}$ in the compounds, and we suggest that a combination of $t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbital splitting due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $d$-$p$ orbital hybridization is responsible for the strongly suppressed ordered magnetic moment.</p>

            <h2>Accurate Formula for the Effective Conductivity of Highly Clustered Two-Phase Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Murray Skolnick, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Two-phase heterogeneous materials arising in a variety of natural and synthetic situations exhibit a wide-variety of microstructures and thus display a broad-spectrum effective physical properties. Given that such properties of disordered materials generally depend on an infinite-set of microstructural correlation functions that are typically unobtainable, in practice, one must consider rigorous bounds and approximations on the effective properties that depend on a limited set of nontrivial microstructural information. Torquato derived [Random Heterogeneous Materials, Microstructure and Macroscopic Properties (2002)] such an approximation for the effective thermal/electrical conductivity of two-phase microstructures that perturb about those that realize the well-known self-consistent formula; a key feature of such microstructures being phase-inversion symmetry which can be observed in certain cellular, bicontinuous, and porous materials. Here, we show via extensive numerical simulations that this virtually unexamined approximation, which depends on up to three-point correlations, predicts accurately the effective conductivities of various two- and three-dimensional two-phase microstructures across phase volume fractions in which both phases can form large and well-connected clusters; including certain phase-inversion symmetric microstructures as well as phase-inversion asymmetric dispersions of certain fully penetrable particles. We also highlight the accurate sensitivity of this approximation to phase-connectedness properties by showing that it predicts percolation thresholds that are in good quantitative and/or qualitative agreement with known thresholds for the models considered here. Finally, we discuss how this formula can be used to design materials with desirable effective conductivity properties and thus aid in materials by design.</p>

            <h2>Large deformation and collapse analysis of re-entrant auxetic and hexagonal honeycomb lattice structures subjected to tension and compression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sima Farshbaf, Narges Dialami, Miguel Cervera</p>
            <p>Additively manufactured auxetic structures offer desirable qualities like lightweight, good energy absorption, excellent indentation resistance, high shear stiffness and fracture toughness among others. A wide range of materials from polymers to metals can be used to fabricate these structures. In contrast to conventional materials, auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Hence, unique mechanical properties can be achieved by specific design. In this work, two types of structures, namely re-entrant auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal honeycomb, are investigated. Large deformation analyses in both 2D plane strain and 3D are conducted using linear triangular and tetrahedral multi-field displacement-pressure elements. Hyperelastic with rate-independent plasticity constitutive models are utilized and calibrated with experimental uni-axial tensile test results. The structures are subjected to compression and tension at both transversal and longitudinal directions. The contact domain method is employed to capture both self-contact and the interaction between the structure and loading plates. The obtained results show consistency with the experimental data. The outcomes of the analyses regarding the re-entrant auxetic structure agree with the expected behavior, showing a negative value of Poisson's ratio and greater efficiency of energy absorption than the hexagonal honeycomb. By understanding the influence of the loading direction on the structural behavior, equivalent Poisson's ratio and energy absorption a reliable theoretical framework for prospective designs of the lattice materials can be established.</p>

            <h2>Capillary force-driven particle orientation in rod networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lingyue Liu, Sebastian Gassenmeier, Erin Koos</p>
            <p>Capillary suspensions containing anisotropic rod particles exhibit complex microstructural behaviors. Our study investigates the orientation, network formation, and rheological properties of glass microrods in capillary suspensions with varying secondary liquid volumes. Using confocal microscopy, rheometry, and rheoconfocal techniques, we reveal how capillary forces affect particle alignment and movement, and consequently, the microstructure of the samples. As the volume fraction of the secondary liquid increases, the structure of the rod network exhibits a transition from point-to-point contact to side-to-side aligned clusters. This structural change leads to pronounced changes in coordination number, clustering coefficient, and particle orientation distribution. In contrast to spherical systems, the average clustering coefficient decreases with increasing coordination number, denoting the formation of particle clusters with complex configurations instead of solely side-to-side alignment. Rheological measurements demonstrate the sensitivity of rod-based networks to deformation, with shorter linear viscoelastic regions compared to spherical particle systems. The research provides insights into designing advanced materials with tunable mechanical properties through controlled particle interactions.</p>

            <h2>Large deviations of density fluctuations in the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Bernard, Tony Jin, Stefano Scopa, Shiyi Wei</p>
            <p>We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Lateral force microscopy calibration using an interferometric atomic force microscope</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel Lefever, Aleksander Labuda, Roger Proksch</p>
            <p>A new method is introduced for calibrating lateral force as measured by an atomic force microscope (AFM), making use of both an interferometric detector and an optical beam detector on the same instrument. The method may be implemented automatically and performed with minimal user input. The microscope has the capability to measure the probe tip height in situ, which allows for a complete lateral force calibration without changing the sample or probe. Two options for lateral force measurements are described wherein the two detectors are alternately used to measure normal and lateral forces, and methods for applying the calibration protocol for both alternatives are provided. The tip height measurement is validated by direct comparison with an electron micrograph and they are generally in agreement to within 1.4 microns. For most cantilevers tested, the complete lateral calibration method is consistent with the wedge calibration method to within the intrinsic uncertainty of the wedge method.</p>

            <h2>A geometrically inspired constitutive framework for damage and intrinsic self-healing of elastomers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanhita Das, Nivedita Kumari</p>
            <p>Autonomic interfacial self-healing in elastomers enables their reprocessing and recycling, making them valuable for applications such as ballistic resistance, surface coatings, adhesives, and biomedical materials. This article prescribes a geometry-based damage-healing theory for autonomic healing in elastomers, built on a framework where damage induces an incompatibility in the Euclidean material manifold, transforming it into a Riemannian manifold. Healing restores the Euclidean state through a reversing damage variable or an evolving healing variable. The reversing damage variable models the rebonding mechanism while the healing variable accounts for healing by chain diffusion and entanglement. The model also predicts healing where rebonding is preceded by chain diffusion. The microforce balance governs the evolution of the damage and healing variables, capturing rate-dependent damage and intrinsic temperature-independent healing. The model is validated through numerical simulations, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations, demonstrating accurate predictions of coupling between damage and healing and post-healing mechanical response. The model also predicts the recovery of fracture toughness with healing time in supramolecular elastomers, aligning with experimental data. With minimal parameters, the model is versatile and can easily be used for material design and structural analysis, surpassing existing models in simplicity and predictive capability.</p>

            <p>Animal morphogenesis involves complex tissue deformation processes, which require tight control over tissue rheology. Yet, it remains insufficiently understood how tissue rheology results from the interplay between its supracellular structure and cellular forces, such as cortical tension, cellular pressure, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we follow a biomimetic approach to study this interplay, focusing on the cellular adhesion hierarchy. We mimic adhesive cells with oil droplets whose adhesion strength and specificity can be flexibly tuned. Using microfluidics, we expose 2D emulsions to an oscillatory shear, and we develop a method to quantify their rheology using only image data. We find that emulsions made of two droplet types with a high adhesion differential progressively change their yielding behavior across subsequent shear cycles. Combining this with vertex model simulations, we show that the observed drift in yielding behavior is due to a progressive compaction, which only occurs in emulsions with a high adhesion differential and only when exposed to oscillatory shear. Gradients of cell compaction have been observed during animal development. Our work demonstrates how such gradients can be used to control gradients of tissue rheological properties. Moreover, the progressive compaction suggests the emergence of a pumping mechanism, which potentially acts in many cellular materials, from tissues to foams.</p>

            <p>Recent works have pointed out some worrisome inconsistencies in linear-response calculations performed with nonlocal pseudopotentials. Here we show that most of these issues are fixed by correctly adapting the pseudopotential to the motion of the corresponding nucleus, with a velocity dependence of the nonlocal operator. This prescription restores the correct Galilean covariance of the Schrödinger equation, and the expected identity between mechanical rototranslations and electromagnetic perturbations. We demonstrate our arguments by relating the interatomic force constants to the electromagnetic susceptibility of the system via a set of exact sum rules. Among other virtues, these results conclusively reconcile the inertial and electrical definitions of the Drude weight in metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Félix Benoist, Luca Peliti, Pablo Sartori</p>
            <p>Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Zhan, Congcong Le, Xianxin Wu, Jiangping Hu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has sparked significant interest in understanding their pairing mechanism and correlated states. While previous theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has been neglected, leaving its effect unexplored and elusive. In this work, we comprehensively explore the effect of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion on both superconductivity and density-wave orders in the presence of onsite interactions by performing functional renormalization group calculations. We find that interlayer repulsion suppresses the interlayer intra-orbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave order, while driving a transition to an interlayer inter-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing and a mirror-symmetry breaking charge order. This transition occurs across a wide range of charge doping and is independent of the presence of the $\gamma$ pocket around M point. Remarkably, the critical scale of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, suggesting that the former pairing is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Additionally, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion promotes an in-plane charge density wave order with a vector of $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings highlight profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and the robustness of interlayer pairing associated with the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, advancing the understanding of the complex correlation effects within bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Chandra</p>
            <p>This study employs Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to investigate the thermomagnetic properties of a site-diluted trilayered ferrimagnetic system with spin-$1/2$ particles placed on square monolayers. The system is composed of two different types of theoretical atoms, labeled $A$ and $B$, resulting in two distinct configurations, $ABA$ and $AAB$. Atoms of the same type $(A-A$ and $B-B)$ exhibit ferromagnetic interactions, while unlike atoms $(A-B)$ display antiferromagnetic interactions. The $A$-layers are randomly site-diluted with non-magnetic atoms and the percentage of dilution is varied from 5\% to 45\%. Depending upon the concentration of these impurities, both the compensation and critical points shift, leading to different equilibrium ferrimagnetic behaviors. The phase area in the Hamiltonian parameter space, \textit{without} compensation, scales according to the relation: $\ln |A(\rho)/\tilde{A}|=ae^{b\rho}$ . Attention is paid to the mathematical relationships between the compensation temperature and the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Suggested mathematical formulas reveal how the threshold impurity concentration is linked to the Hamiltonian parameters.</p>

            <p>Recently, numerous techniques have been reported for generating optically active defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which hold transformative potential for quantum photonic devices. However, achieving on-demand generation of desirable defect types in scalable hBN films remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that formation of negative boron vacancy defects, VB-, in suspended, large-area CVD-grown hBN is strongly dependent on the type of bombarding particles (ions, neutrons, and electrons) and irradiation conditions. In contrast to suspended hBN, defect formation in substrate-supported hBN is more complex due to the uncontrollable generation of secondary particles from the substrate, and the outcome strongly depends on the thickness of the hBN. We identify different defect types by correlating spectroscopic and optically detected magnetic resonance features, distinguishing boron vacancies (formed by light ions and neutrons) from other optically active defects emitting at 650 nm assigned to anti-site nitrogen vacancy (NBVN) and reveal the presence of additional dark paramagnetic defects that influence spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and zero-field splitting parameters, all of which strongly depend on the defect density. These results underscore the potential for precisely engineered defect formation in large-scale CVD-grown hBN, paving the way for the scalable fabrication of quantum photonic devices.</p>

For this purpose the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations are employed.

Liq., 2021, 323, 114576], combined with the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ water model. In perspective, the methanol model permits a convenient extension for other monohydric alcohols mixed with water. The behavior of density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy are described. Partial mixing properties are interpreted. Besides, we explored the trends of behavior of self-diffusion coefficients of the species of a mixture. The quality of predictions of the model is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Various results are novel and provide new insights into the behavior of the mixtures in question at different temperatures and at high pressures.

            <h2>Variational solution of the superconducting Anderson impurity model and the band-edge singularity phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teodor Iličin, Rok Žitko</p>
            <p>We propose a set of variational wavefunctions for the sub-gap spin-doublet and spin-singlet eigenstates of the particle-hole symmetric superconducting Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions include up to two Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the continuum which is necessary to correctly capture the weak-coupling asymptotics in all parameter regimes. The eigenvalue problems reduce to solving transcendental equations. We investigate how the lowest singlet state evolves with increasing charge repulsion $U$, transitioning from a proximitized state (a superposition of empty and doubly occupied impurity orbitals, corresponding to an Andreev bound state) to a local moment that is Kondo screened by Bogoliubov quasiparticles (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state). This change occurs for $U = 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the BCS gap. At this point, the band-edge effects make the eigenenergy scale in a singular way as $\Gamma^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization strength. Away from this special point, regular $\Gamma$-linear behavior is recovered, but only for $\Gamma \lesssim (U/2-\Delta)^2/\Delta$. The singular behavior thus extends over a broad range of parameters, including those relevant for some quantum devices in current use. The singular state is an equal-superposition state with maximal fluctuations between the local impurity charge configurations. Accurately capturing the band-edge singularity requires a continuum model, and it cannot be correctly described by discrete (truncated) models such as the zero-bandwidth approximation or the superconducting atomic limit. We determine the region of parameter space where the second spin-singlet state exists: in addition to the whole $U<2\Delta$ ABS region, it also includes a small part of the $U>2\Delta$ YSR region for finite values of $\Gamma$, as long as some ABS component is admixed.</p>

            <p>The excess entropy of restricted primitive model electrolytes is calculated using a potential based approach through the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. The theories are utilized in conjunction with a statistical thermodynamics equation that is shown to be equivalent to thermodynamic integration. Electrolyte systems having ionic valencies 1:1 and 2:2 with diameters $3 \times 10^{-10}$~m and 4.25 $\times 10^{-10}$ m are treated over a wide range of concentrations. The exact radial distribution functions for the model electrolytes obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble are compared with the corresponding theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions from the theories and the simulations are used in the Laird-Haymet entropy expansion equations [J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3775] to estimate the excess entropy of the solutions. These equations take into account multi-particle distribution functions, which are approximated using a ``ring'' term. In general, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives results that are more consistent with the simulation data than those from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The results show that the excess entropy is negative with its absolute value increasing for 1:1 electrolytes with increasing concentration. The symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly overestimated, while the modified Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly underestimated relative to the simulations. The curves for 1:1 electrolytes including that from the Laird-Haymet equations are consistent with each other, while only the MPB curves for 2:2 electrolytes at $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m are qualitative relative to the simulations up to about 1 mol/dm$^{3}$.

For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Yi Huang, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moiré mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p>

            <h2>Path integral calculation for emergence of rapid evolution from demographic stochasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Yan Shih, Nigel Goldenfeld</p>
            <p>Genetic variation in a population can sometimes arise so fast as to modify ecosystem dynamics. Such phenomena have been observed in natural predator-prey systems, and characterized in the laboratory as showing unusual phase relationships in population dynamics, including a $\pi$ phase shift between predator and prey (evolutionary cycles) and even undetectable prey oscillations compared to those of the predator (cryptic cycles). Here we present a generic individual-level stochastic model of interacting populations that includes a subpopulation of low nutritional value to the predator. Using a master equation formalism, and by mapping to a coherent state path integral solved by a system-size expansion, we show that evolutionary and cryptic quasicycles can emerge generically from the combination of intrinsic demographic fluctuations and clonal mutations alone, without additional biological mechanisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Douglas Z. Plummer, Emily D'Alessandro, Aidan Burrowes, Joshua Fleischer, Alexander M. Heard, Yingying Wu</p>
            <p>The demand for computing power has been growing exponentially with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This growth requires unconventional computing primitives that prioritize energy efficiency, while also addressing the critical need for scalability. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the biological brain, offers a transformative paradigm for addressing these challenges. This review paper provides an overview of advancements in 2D spintronics and device architectures designed for neuromorphic applications, with a focus on techniques such as spin-orbit torque, magnetic tunnel junctions, and skyrmions. Emerging van der Waals materials like CrI3, Fe3GaTe2, and graphene-based heterostructures have demonstrated unparalleled potential for integrating memory and logic at the atomic scale. This work highlights technologies with ultra-low energy consumption (0.14 fJ/operation), high switching speeds (sub-nanosecond), and scalability to sub-20 nm footprints. It covers key material innovations and the role of spintronic effects in enabling compact, energy-efficient neuromorphic systems, providing a foundation for advancing scalable, next-generation computing architectures.</p>

            <p>The historical calculation of spectroscopic properties for trivalent lanthanide ions is a complex multistep process that has been prone to inaccuracies. In this work, we revise the parametric semi-empirical Hamiltonian and address long-standing discrepancies in the literature. We also resurface the distinctions between orthogonal and non-orthogonal operators and use orthogonal operators to provide an alternative parametric description. Based on experimental data available in the literature, a new set of parameter values for the ions in LaF$_3$ and LiYF$_4$ is presented. Additionally, we provide calculations of spontaneous emission rates and oscillator strengths for magnetic dipole transitions in the LaF$_3$ crystal host. To ensure the replicability of our findings, we make available the open-source code $\mathbf{\texttt{qlanth}}$, accompanied by a comprehensive set of electronic files to serve as an updated reference for future calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raju Kumar Yadav, Prince Philip, Boddepalli SanthiBhushan</p>
            <p>While doping and defects are often considered detrimental to material performance, at the nanoscale, modifications are needed to create novel properties beneficial for device applications. In this work, we focus on optimizing graphene as a gas sensor for detecting toxic gases such as nitrogen oxide (NO). The study explores the effects of doping graphene sheets with transition metals (Cu, Au, Pt) and introducing a single vacancy (SV) defect at the center of the sheet. Pristine, defected, and doped graphene sheets are systematically analyzed as potential sensing materials for NO gas detection. The investigation includes the design of graphene-based devices and the evaluation of their electrical I-V characteristics under different configurations. The sensing mechanism is examined through parameters such as electronic properties, charge transfer, adsorption energy, electrical characteristics (I-V), sensitivity, and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. The results indicate that defected graphene demonstrates superior gas adsorption performance, with an adsorption energy of 8.316 eV and a sensitivity of 51.1%, outperforming both pristine and doped graphene. These findings establish defected graphene as a promising candidate for NO gas sensing applications, while doped graphene shows moderate sensing potential.</p>

            <h2>An atomistic approach for modeling of polarizability and Raman scattering of water clusters and liquid water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atanu Paul, Ilya Grinberg</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a framework for atomistic modeling of electronic polarizability to predict the Raman spectra of hydrogen-bonded clusters and liquids from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The total polarizability of the system is assumed to arise from contributions of both the monomer unit and intermolecular interactions. The generalized bond-polarizability model (GBPM), inspired by the classic bond-polarizability model, effectively describes the electronic polarizability of a monomer. To account for the electronic polarizability arising from intermolecular interactions, we use a basis set of rapidly decaying functions of interatomic distances. We apply this model to calculate the electronic polarizability and Raman spectra of water clusters ((H2O)r, r = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and liquid water. The computational results are compared with the results of quantum-mechanical calculations for clusters and to experimental data for the liquid. It is demonstrated that this simple and physically motivated model, which relies on a small number of parameters, performs well for clusters at both low and high temperatures, capturing strong anharmonic effects. Moreover, its high transferability suggests its applicability to other water clusters. These results suggest that a hierarchical approach based on the Jacob's ladder of increasingly sophisticated and accurate atomistic polarizability models incorporating additional effects can be used for efficient modeling of Raman spectra from MD simulations of clusters, liquids and solids.</p>

            <h2>Making Truncated Wigner for dissipative spins 'plain easy'</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Hosseinabadi, Oksana Chelpanova, Jamir Marino</p>
            <p>We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA outperforms the method of cumulant expansion in terms of efficiency, ease of use, and broad applicability. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Kibe, Pratik Roy</p>
            <p>The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.</p>

            <h2>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz</p>
            <p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p>

            <h2>Equivariant Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Global Charge Redistribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moin Uddin Maruf, Sungmin Kim, Zeeshan Ahmad</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to quantum mechanical simulations for predicting material properties. Message-passing graph neural networks, commonly used in these MLIPs, rely on local descriptor-based symmetry functions to model atomic interactions. However, such local descriptor-based approaches struggle with systems exhibiting long-range interactions, charge transfer, and compositional heterogeneity. In this work, we develop a new equivariant MLIP incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions through explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom, specifically global charge distribution within the system. This is achieved using a charge equilibration scheme based on predicted atomic electronegativities. We systematically evaluate our model across a range of benchmark periodic and non-periodic datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both short-range equivariant and long-range invariant MLIPs in energy and force predictions. Our approach enables more accurate and efficient simulations of systems with long-range interactions and charge heterogeneity, expanding the applicability of MLIPs in computational materials science.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srijan Kumar</p>
            <p>We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</p>

            <p>In Ref. arXiv:2502.08816, Hawking radiation was analyzed through a statistical mechanics framework, revealing a structured microstate description of black hole horizons and information transfer into the radiation background. This study extends that approach by formulating Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation in the language of stochastic mechanics, employing an analytical Langevin framework and a numerical Euler iteration scheme. Both methods confirm that small black holes behave as thermal systems with Gaussian noise, while larger black holes develop a structured noise spectrum that aligns with the gradual contraction of the horizon. This suggests an alternative interpretation of Hawking radiation as an effective surface fuzziness, encoding horizon-scale fluctuations. The appendix provides a Wolfram Mathematica blueprint for numerical simulations, open to heuristic modifications for further exploration of black hole noise spectra.</p>

            <p>We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the asymmetric parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form $$\begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*}$$ and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with strong Szegő limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.</p>

Extending the recently formulated effective field theory for weakly bound Borromean nuclei, we incorporate corrections arising from the effective range of neutron-neutron scattering and evaluate their impact on the mean-square radii and electromagnetic response. In particular, we compute the ratio of the matter and charge radii, the shape of the $E1$ dipole strength function, and the electric polarizability. Our results indicate that these corrections remain numerically small when the two-neutron separation energy of the Borromean nucleus is much less than 1~MeV.</p>

We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.</p>

We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.</p>

            <p>Learning to remember over long timescales is fundamentally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While much prior work has explored why RNNs struggle to learn long timescales and how to mitigate this, we still lack a clear understanding of the dynamics involved when RNNs learn long timescales via gradient descent. Here we build a mathematical theory of the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained to integrate white noise. We show that when the initial recurrent weights are small, the dynamics of learning are described by a low-dimensional system that tracks a single outlier eigenvalue of the recurrent weights. This reveals the precise manner in which the long timescale associated with white noise integration is learned. We extend our analyses to RNNs learning a damped oscillatory filter, and find rich dynamical equations for the evolution of a conjugate pair of outlier eigenvalues. Taken together, our analyses build a rich mathematical framework for studying dynamical learning problems salient for both machine learning and neuroscience.</p>

            <p>We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,1)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</p>

            <p>We report fundamental insights into how agentic graph reasoning systems spontaneously evolve toward a critical state that sustains continuous semantic discovery. By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of "surprising" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.</p>

            <p>Spin ice compounds enable the exploration of the dynamics of magnetic monopoles in condensed matter systems. In this study, we use ac calorimetry to probe the dynamical response of the heat capacity of the classical spin-ice compounds Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures (0.5-5 K). Using frequencies of 0.01-500 Hz, we find a strong frequency dependence in the measured heat capacity and are able to study thermal relaxation effects on the corresponding timescales. The relaxation time $\tau$ is determined from the frequency dependence of the heat capacity as the characteristic frequency below which the heat capacity saturates. The extracted $\tau$ shows a divergent behavior below 1 K reaching $\sim$6 s at 0.65 K, similar to the relaxation time seen in previous studies. Corresponding specific heat shows a maximum around this temperature. Performing dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we verify that the specific heat frequency response has its origin in the slow magnetic monopole dynamics indigenous to spin ice. We find a timescale of 20 ms per Monte Carlo step at 4 K in contrast to 2.5 ms mentioned in previous studies by other techniques.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase transitions universally exist in the ground and excited states of quantum many-body systems, and they have a close relationship with the nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions, which however are challenging to identify. In the system of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates, though dynamical phase transitions with correspondence to equilibrium phase transitions in the ground state and uppermost excited state have been probed, those taken place in intermediate excited states remain untouched in experiments thus far. Here we unravel that both the ground and excited-state quantum phase transitions in spinor condensates can be diagnosed with dynamical phase transitions. A connection between equilibrium phase transitions and nonequilibrium behaviors of the system is disclosed in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We also demonstrate that near the critical points parameter estimation beyond standard quantum limit can be implemented. This work not only advances the exploration of excited-state quantum phase transitions via a scheme that can immediately be applied to a broad class of few-mode quantum systems, but also provides new perspective on the relationship between quantum criticality and quantum enhanced sensing.</p>

            <h2>Spin-resolved electronic structure of ferromagnetic triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prosper Ngabonziza, Jonathan D. Denlinger, Alexei V. Fedorov, Gang Cao, J. W. Allen, G. Gebreyesus, Richard M. Martin</p>
            <p>High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ reveals features of the electronic structure that extend our understanding of the layered strontium ruthenates. The spectra near the Fermi energy are very different from the non-magnetic analogues Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi surface contours around the zone corners. The most dramatic results are two narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV below the Fermi-level, a spin-minority hole-like band at the Brillouin zone center, and a spin-majority saddle-band van Hove singularity at the zone edge, which exhibits almost 100\% spin-polarization at low temperature, and a strong temperature dependent coherence-incoherence crossover attributed to Hund metal correlations. Quantitative comparison of the ARPES to spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify the specific antibonding and nonbonding orbital origins of the narrow bands, with a prediction of different spatial localization in the central and outer layers. This is shown to be consistent with experimental ARPES multi-zone matrix element intensity variations, and implicates outer-layer-specific control of the in-plane metamagnetism. The renormalization of the bands relative to the mean-field DFT, the demonstration of spin-polarized oxygen bands, and of spin-minority and spin-majority band-crossing hybridization, provide a more complete picture of the magnetism which displays aspects of both delocalized and local moment behavior.</p>

            <h2>Unusually Strong Four-Phonon Scattering Effects on Low-Temperature Thermal Conductivity in Two-Dimensional Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. F. Feng, B. Liu, Xin-Gao Gong, Zhi-Xin Guo</p>
            <p>First principles-based predictions of lattice thermal conductivity (TC) from perturbation theory have achieved significant success. Usually, it only included three-phonon (3ph) scattering processes, only recently four-phonon (4ph) scattering processes were found to have a comparable impact as 3ph scattering at medium and high temperatures in various materials. While the influence of 4ph scattering on TC at low temperatures was generally believed to be insignificant. By combining the first-principles calculations, machine learning techniques, and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), we find that there are unusually strong 4ph processes even in the low-frequency range of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as h-XN (X = B, Al, Ga), which have a remarkable influence on the low-temperature TC. Such strong 4ph processes originated from the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) phonon mode of 2D materials. Furthermore, we find that the intensity of 4ph scattering and thus TC can be effectively manipulated by changing the dispersion of ZA phonon mode, which can be easily achieved through strain engineering. The present study provides new insights into low-temperature phonon transport and its manipulation in 2D materials.</p>

            <h2>Respective Roles of Electron-Phonon and Electron-Electron Interactions in the Transport and Quasiparticle Properties of SrVO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David J. Abramovitch, Jernej Mravlje, Jin-Jian Zhou, Antoine Georges, Marco Bernardi</p>
            <p>The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here, using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO: they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range above 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph interactions in SVO.</p>

            <h2>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobuyuki Okuma</p>
            <p>In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</p>

            <h2>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Vivek, Debabrata Mondal, Subhadeep Chakraborty, S. Sinha</p>
            <p>We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</p>

            <h2>Error evaluation of partial scattering functions obtained from contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koichi Mayumi, Tatsuro Oda, Shinya Miyajima, Ippei Obayashi, Kazuaki Tanaka</p>
            <p>Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) is a powerful tool to evaluate the structure of multi-component systems by decomposing scattering intensities $I$ measured with different scattering contrasts into partial scattering functions $S$ of self- and cross-correlations between components. The measured $I$ contains a measurement error, $\Delta I$, and $\Delta I$ results in an uncertainty of partial scattering functions, $\Delta S$. However, the error propagation from $\Delta I$ to $\Delta S$ has not been quantitatively clarified. In this work, we have established deterministic and statistical approaches to determine $\Delta S$ from $\Delta I$. We have applied the two methods to (i) computational data of a core-shell sphere and experimental CV-SANS data of (ii) clay/polyethylene glycol (PEG) aqueous solutions and (iii) polyrotaxane solutions, and have successfully estimated the errors of \(S\). The quantitative error estimation of \(S\) offers us a strategy to optimize the combination of scattering contrasts to minimize error propagation.</p>

            <h2>A General Approach for Determining Applicability Domain of Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lane E. Schultz, Yiqi Wang, Ryan Jacobs, Dane Morgan</p>
            <p>Knowledge of the domain of applicability of a machine learning model is essential to ensuring accurate and reliable model predictions. In this work, we develop a new and general approach of assessing model domain and demonstrate that our approach provides accurate and meaningful domain designation across multiple model types and material property data sets. Our approach assesses the distance between data in feature space using kernel density estimation, where this distance provides an effective tool for domain determination. We show that chemical groups considered unrelated based on chemical knowledge exhibit significant dissimilarities by our measure. We also show that high measures of dissimilarity are associated with poor model performance (i.e., high residual magnitudes) and poor estimates of model uncertainty (i.e., unreliable uncertainty estimation). Automated tools are provided to enable researchers to establish acceptable dissimilarity thresholds to identify whether new predictions of their own machine learning models are in-domain versus out-of-domain.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic density functional theory for ions in a polar solvent</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Illien, Antoine Carof, Benjamin Rotenberg</p>
            <p>In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Patrón, C. A. Plata, A. Prados</p>
            <p>We study the problem of minimising the connection time between non-equilibrium steady states of the Brownian Gyrator. This is a paradigmatic model in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, an overdamped Brownian particle trapped in a two-dimensional elliptical potential, with the two degrees of freedom $(x,y)$ coupled to two, in principle different, thermal baths with temperatures $T_x$ and $T_y$, respectively. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle reveals that shortest protocols belong to the boundaries of the control set defined by the limiting values of the parameters $(k,u)$ characterising the elliptical potential. We identify two classes of optimal minimum time protocols, i.e. brachistochrones: (i) regular bang-bang protocols, for which $(k,u)$ alternatively take their minimum and maximum values allowed, and (ii) infinitely degenerate singular protocols. We thoroughly investigate the minimum connection time over the brachistochrones in the limit of having infinite capacity for compression. A plethora of striking phenomena emerge: sets of states attained at null connection times, discontinuities in the connection time along adjacent target states, and the fact that, starting from a state in which the oscillators are coupled, uncoupled states are impossible to reach in a finite time.</p>

            <h2>Partial presentence of memory in bubble breakup: incomplete universality acquired by broken symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ikumi Yoshino, Ko Okumura</p>
            <p>When a water drop falls from a faucet, the drop is created with the formation of an axisymmetric constriction region, which thins down to breakup. Near the singularity of the breakup the physics at small scales becomes important, which could lead to universal dynamics independent of the scales setting the initial boundary conditions, as if memories were lost. This is true in the drop breakup surrounded by air or less viscous fluid, but not in the bubble breakup surrounded by more viscous fluid, under no geometrical confinement. Recently, it has been reported that the axisymmetry at the constriction region can be broken when a system of bubble breakup is confined. Here, we focus on the confined and non-axisymmetric breakup and find its dynamics self-similar: shapes of the liquid-air interface at different times collapsing onto a master curve. Unexpectedly, the master curve depends on the smallest among the length scales setting the initial boundary conditions but not on the other scales: The system retains partial memory, acquiring an incomplete universality by broken symmetry. Furthermore, we find the collapse is space-time dependent: the collapse onto the linear region of the master curve near the breakup tip persists for long time after breakup, while the parabolic region away from the tip is observed only for short time. We elucidate the physics in our findings, including the space-time dependent collapse, exploiting analogy with critical phenomena, which has guided recent developments across physics.</p>

            <h2>Correlation versus dissipation in a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Masaya Nakagawa, Norio Kawakami</p>
            <p>We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</p>

            <p>A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.</p>

This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, however, or for sufficiently small systems, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.</p>

We derive analytical results for the limiting cases of strong and weak interactions, and provide a general procedure for calculating one-body correlations at any interaction strength. A step-by-step explanation of the numerical method used to compute Green's functions (needed as input to our theory) is included. We benchmark our method against exact numerical calculations and compare its predictions to recent experimental results.</p>

            <p>Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport thus has attracted tremendous interest. However, without comparing with mechanisms tied to disorder, it is still unclear whether the quantum metric dominates in recent experiments. We exhaust all possible mechanisms of nonlinear transport under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges, by finding five more disorder-related mechanisms and their nonlinear conductivity formulas. With the help of the formulas, we derive the scaling law to identify distinct mechanisms in the recent experiments [Gao, et al., Science 381, 181 (2023); Wang, et al., Nature 621, 487 (2023)], determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for all 122 magnetic point groups to guide future experiments, and calculate the nonlinear conductivity to explain the sophisticated features in the experiments of the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films.

            <p>Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.</p>

In this context, an improved physical understanding of the g-factor of MoS2 depending on device geometry is of great importance. Resistively detected electron spin resonance (RD-ESR) could be employed to and the determine the g-factor in micron-scale devices However, its application and RD-ESR studies have been limited by Schottky or high-resistance contacts to MoS2. Here, we exploit naturally n-doped few-layer MoS2 devices with ohmic tin (Sn) contacts that allow the electrical study of spin phenomena. Resonant excitation of electron spins and resistive detection is a possible path to exploit the spin effects in MoS2 devices. Using RD-ESR, we determine the g-factor of few-layer MoS2 to be ~1.92 and observe that the g-factor value is independent of the charge carrier density within the limits of our measurements.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Xu, Xue-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of string breaking are observed across various quantum simulation platforms \cite{Rydberg_kagome,qbit_string_breaking}. However, the strings can only be broken by quenching the tension energy due to the system size limitation, such "tensile breaking" behaves quite the same as in one-dimension \cite{ion_string_breaking}. To discover the distinctive properties of quantum strings in two dimensions, we utilize a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method to simulate a ten times larger scale (743-site) Kagome Rydberg atom array which can be described with U(1) lattice gauge theory. With designed edges, one end of the string can be easily grasped, allowing for clearly observing the dynamics of the dangling gauge charge at the open end. Then, we can drag each end in opposite directions perpendicular to the string. As the separation distance increases, asymptotic freedom-like behavior is detected. Eventually, the string breaks because the distance between both ends surpasses the string's length, so named "geometric breaking". Distinct from "tensile breaking," the two newly formed strings are suddenly uncorrelated, accompanied by a sudden energy increase. Lastly, we study multiple strings and successfully prepare a heart-like superposition state of broken and unbroken quantum strings with three gauge charges attached reminiscent of quarks and gluon. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>The wave-like nature of electrons is evident from quantum interference effects observed during the photoemission process. When there are different nuclei in the unit cell of a crystal and/or structural distortions, photo-electron wavefunctions can interfere, giving rise to peculiar intensity modulation of the spectrum, which can also hide energy states in a photoemission experiment. The 2H phase of transition metal dichalcogenides, with two nonequivalent layers per unit cell and charge density wave distortion, is an optimal platform for such effects to be observed. Here, we discover undetectable states in 2H-TaS2, interpreting high-resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy considering interference effects of the correlated electron wave functions. In addition, phase mismatching induced by the charge density wave distortion, results in evident signature of the phase transition in the photoemission spectrum. Our results highlight the importance of quantum interference, electronic correlations and structural distortion to understand the physics of layered materials.</p>

Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials.

We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> SangEun Han, Shouryya Ray, Igor F. Herbut</p>
            <p>We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</p>

            <h2>Field-free Josephson diode effect in interacting chiral quantum dot junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debika Debnath, Paramita Dutta</p>
            <p>We investigate chiral quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction and show the correlation-induced Josephson diode effect (JDE) in it. The presence of electron-electron interaction spontaneously creates an imbalance between up- and down-spin electrons during the non-equilibrium transport making the QD effectively magnetic. The simultaneous presence of the chirality and the interaction eventually results in the field-free JDE in our chiral QD junction. We employ the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique to study the behavior of the Josephson current (JC) and the rectification coefficient (RC) of our Josephson diode (JD). We show a sign-changing behavior of the RC with the Coulomb correlation and the lead-to-dot coupling strength and find the maximum magnitude of the RC $\sim 72\%$ for moderate interaction strength. Our proposed field-free JD based on interacting chiral QD may be a potential switching component in superconductor based devices.</p>

            <h2>Redefining the dielectric response of nanoconfined liquids: insights from water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jon Zubeltzu, Fernando Bresme, Matthew Dawber, Marivi Fernandez-Serra, Emilio Artacho</p>
            <p>Recent experiments show that the relative dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of water confined to a film of nanometric thickness reaches a strikingly low value of 2.1, barely above the bulk's 1.8 value for the purely electronic response. We argue that $\epsilon$ is not a well-defined measure for dielectric properties at sub-nanometer scales due to the ambiguous definition of confinement width. Instead we propose the 2D polarisability $\alpha_{\perp}$ as the appropriate, well-defined response function whose magnitude can be directly obtained from both measurements and computations. Once the appropriate description is used a very significant reduction, $\sim 30$\%, of the electronic response with respect to the bulk's is observed contrary to what widely assumed, highlighting the importance of electronic degrees of freedom to interpret the dielectric response of polar fluids under nanoconfinement conditions. This is obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Thalmeier, Alireza Akbari, Burkhard Schmidt</p>
            <p>The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 exhibits unconventional superconductivity accompanied by other broken symmetry phases that have been identified as presumably small moment intrinsic antiferromagnetism at low magnetic fields and induced quadrupolar order at higher in-plane fields. The latter may extend to very large pulsed-field range. The phase boundaries can be investigated by following thermodynamic anomalies like specific heat, magnetocaloric coefficient, thermal expansion and magnetostriction. We calculate their discontinuities and identify the influence of the field induced quadrupole on them. Furthermore we investigate the elastic constant anomalies which are determined by the static homogeneous quadrupolar RPA response functions. We present a calculation of these anomalies for the appropriate symmetry mode both in the disordered and ordered regime and investigate their change with applied field. In addition we consider the dynamical momentum dependent magnetic susceptibility and the associated dispersion of low energy magnetic modes and how their characteristics change across the phase boundary.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Purnendu Das, Sumilan Banerjee</p>
            <p>Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. We show that, even in the absence of any external thermal bath, the monitoring leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective `quantum' temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in unusual inverse transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Trenins, Mariana Rossi</p>
            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Motohiko Ezawa</p>
            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect is a photocurrent generation from alternating electric field, which is a promising candidate for future efficient solar cell technology. It is the second-order optical current, which is the injection current or the shift current. We focus on the direct current generation. By employing a simple two-band model of the $d$-wave altermagnet coupled with the Rashba interaction, we show that the linearly polarized light can generate the injection and shift currents when the Néel vector points to an in-plane direction. The magnitude of the injection current is almost constant over a wide range of the frequency $\omega $ of the applied light provided it is smaller than a certain critical frequency $\omega _{\text{c}}$ and larger than the bulk gap energy $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}$, $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}<\hbar \omega <\hbar \omega _{\text{c}}$. Hence, the use of the injection current is quite efficient for solar cell technology because any photon whose energy is within this range can be equally utilized.</p>

            <p>We report on an experimental study of spin and valley blockade in two-electron bilayer graphene (BLG) double quantum dots (DQDs) and explore the limits set by asymmetric orbitals and electronelectron interactions. The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.</p>

            <p>Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and 4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.</p>

In dispersions the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials, although the physical picture is often elusive. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, and we show that a simple, well-fitting model can induce misinterpretation of the physics in a complex material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Carolyn Zhang</p>
            <p>Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</p>

A phase diagram characterizes the expected measurement variability and delineates scaling law conditions.

            <p>We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of the two-dimensional Ising model. Our findings provide a novel insights into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Wang, Andrey V. Chubukov</p>
            <p>In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</p>

            <p>We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.</p>

            <p>As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal becomes necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering directions, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches, and features may appear with no clear explanation. To explore both, we perform frequency-resolved q-EELS simulations via the multislice method and compare results to Spectral Energy Density (SED) and Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. We discuss common misconceptions of phonon behavior and characterization generally and in the context of measured or simulated q-EELS signals. We highlight the presence of an ``interferometric Brillouin zone'' (closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor), resulting from the simultaneous sampling of the lattice across each basis index. We also demonstrate the scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective signal based on this phenomena. Finally, we identify thickness-dependent sensitivity effects, where the upper surface of a film is sampled at a disproportionate level. We show that this can yield sensitivity to through-plane vibrational modes, which may be measured experimentally assuming sufficient sensitivity can be achieved. Our work should serve as a road map to guide momentum-resolved vibrational EELS measurements in the future, particularly as ever-increasing energy and momentum resolution becomes available.</p>

            <p>Constraint Satisfaction Problems are ubiquitous in fields ranging from the physics of solids to artificial intelligence. In many cases, such systems undergo a transition when the ratio of constraints to variables reaches some value $\alpha_{\textrm{crit}}$. Above this critical value, it is exponentially unlikely that all constraints can be mutually satisfied. We calculate the probability that constraints can all be satisfied, $P(\textrm{SAT})$, for the spherical perceptron. Traditional replica methods, such as the Parisi ansatz, fall short. We find a new ansatz, the jammed Parisi ansatz, that correctly describes the behavior of the system in this regime. With the jammed Parisi ansatz, we calculate $P(\textrm{SAT})$ for the first time and match previous computations of thresholds. We anticipate that the techniques developed here will be applicable to general constraint satisfaction problems and the identification of hidden structures in data sets.</p>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1° hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3°, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37° twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.</p>

The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures.

In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz~7.7 of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</p>

            <p>Quasicrystals exhibit superconductivity under the unique interplay of long-range order and strong inhomogeneity, distinguishing them from both crystalline and amorphous systems. Understanding how this structural complexity affects superconducting states and phase transitions remains an important open question. Here, we unveil anomalous superconductivity in a dodecagonal quasicrystal using the attractive Hubbard model within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We show that both the gap structure and critical temperature depend on the local pattern due to inhomogeneous charge distribution and kinetic terms. This leads to unconventional phase transitions between mixed phases where superconducting and normal metal regions coexist, even without external fields, which we term pattern-selective superconductivity. Furthermore, superconductivity can be anomalously suppressed even under stronger attractive interactions due to the alignment of the Fermi level with a spectral gap in the fragmented Hartree-shifted spectrum. These findings, not observed in conventional crystals, amorphous systems, or previous studies of quasicrystal superconductivity, highlight the distinct role of quasicrystalline order.</p>

            <p>Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</p>

            <h2>Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Karbowski</p>
            <p>Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zehuan Tang, Tingfeng Ma, Boyue Su, Qing Xia, Pengfei Kang, Bowei Wu</p>
            <p>When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observe anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated because of the implied symmetries between the two steady states, on the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition mode under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effects are no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</p>

            <h2>Exponential mixing of all orders for Arnol'd cat map lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minos Axenides, Emmanuel Floratos, Stam Nicolis</p>
            <p>We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l>2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</p>

            <h2>Quantum reservoir probing of quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Kobayashi, Yukitoshi Motome</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lin Chen, Ling-Yan Hung, Yikun Jiang, Bing-Xin Lao</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</p>

            <p>Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</p>

We specify the closed-form expression of the counterdiabatic control and demonstrate its efficiency in suppressing excitations.</p>

            <h2>Glassy dynamics in deep neural networks: A structural comparison</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Kerr Winter, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen</p>
            <p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</p>

            <p>We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</p>

            <h2>Unifying theory of scaling in drop impact: Forces & maximum spreading diameter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vatsal Sanjay, Detlef Lohse</p>
            <p>The dynamics of drop impact on a rigid surface -- omnipresent in nature and technology -- strongly depends on the droplet's velocity, its size, and its material properties. The main characteristics are the droplet's force exerted on the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is: How do they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber number $We$ (non-dimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity)? Here we perform direct numerical simulations over the huge parameter range $1\le We \le 10^3$ and $10^{-3}\le Oh \le 10^2$ and in particular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the Grossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000); PRL 86, 3316 (2001)]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation rate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different physical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively account for the $We$ and $Oh$ dependences of the maximal impact force and the maximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why viscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for low-viscosity droplets (low $Oh$), in contrast to what had been assumed in prior theories.</p>

            <p>We calculate, to second order in the scattering length between two fermions, the Landau quasiparticle interaction for a low-density mixture of two fermion species with unequal densities at temperature zero. From the Landau parameters we evaluate the energy density and find agreement with the result of Kanno, Prog. Theor. Phys. 44, 813 (1970). The calculations are then extended to the case of two fermion components with different total densities, each with two spin components, a situation of interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics, where the species are neutrons and protons. An interesting finding is that, for low proton concentrations, $x \ll 1$, the leading term in the energy density, beyond the $x^{5/3}$ contribution from the kinetic energy and the $x^2$ one due to the two-body interaction in the mean-field approximation, varies as $x^{7/3} \ln x$. This is to be contrasted with the higher powers of $x$ implicit in many phenomenological energy-density functionals employed in nuclear physics, such as those of the Skyrme type.</p>

            <h2>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiuci Xu</p>
            <p>We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical evolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and the crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to the $6j$-symbol of $U_{\sqrt{q}}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total chord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</p>

            <h2>Near linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Wesle, Giovanna Marcelli, Tadahiro Miyao, Domenico Monaco, Stefan Teufel</p>
            <p>We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a locally unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_{\mathrm{H}}$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance. A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</p>

            <p>We report on tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at 10 K. The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant red-shift of the H-H stretch frequency is found as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.</p>

The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-Pérot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz.

A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is first considered, and its wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. By creating unit cells from two identical Willis-type elastic layers, yet with reversed Willis-coupling signs, a reciprocal band structure peculiarly emerges, although each layer exhibits non-reciprocity if considered individually. Wavenumber bandgaps open due to such unit cell configuration, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Bigoni, Andrea Piccolroaz</p>
            <p>Two classes of non-linear elastic materials are derived via two-dimensional homogenization. These materials are equivalent to a periodic grid of axially-deformable and axially-preloaded structural elements, subject to incremental deformations that involve bending, shear, and normal forces. The unit cell of one class is characterized by elements where deformations are lumped within a finite-degrees-of-freedom framework. In contrast, the other class involves smeared deformation, modelled as flexurally deformable rods with sufficiently high axial compliance. Under increasing compressive load, the elasticity tensor of the equivalent material loses positive definiteness and subsequently undergoes an ellipticity loss. Remarkably, in certain conditions, this loss of stability is followed by a subsequent restabilization; that is, the material re-enters the elliptic regime and even the positive definiteness domain and simultaneously, the underlying elastic lattice returns to a stable state. This effect is closely related to the axial compliance of the elements. Our results: (i.) demonstrate new possibilities for exploiting structural elements within the elastic range, characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom, to create architected materials with tuneable instabilities, (ii.) introduce reconfigurable materials characterized by 'islands' of stability or instability.</p>

With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.</p>

This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.</p>

            <p>A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</p>

            <p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p>

            <p>We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B>B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B<B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</p>

First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</p>

            <h2>Highly efficient exciton-exciton annihilation in single conjugated polymer chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicola J. Fairbairn, Olga Vodianova, Gordon J. Hedley</p>
            <p>The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and its time dependence. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number rises only to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophores that facilitates efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. The results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised to control exciton-exciton annihilation.</p>

            <h2>Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jayarshi Bhattacharya, Gautam Gangopadhyay, Sunandan Gangopadhyay</p>
            <p>This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Noise equals endogenous control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric De Giuli</p>
            <p>Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of endogenous control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, control is optimal and an exact mathematical mapping from noise to control is described, where the maximizing the probability of a state becomes the control objective. In Langevin dynamics noise is identified directly with control, while in general Markov jump processes, which include chemical reaction networks and electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Zel'dovich-Grassberger-Goldenfeld-Peliti path integral to identify the `response' or `tilt' field $\pi$ as control, which is proportional to the noise in the semiclassical limit. This solves the longstanding problem of interpreting $\pi$. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks and systems with unstable fixed points. The noise-control mapping builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why the probability is generically a non-smooth function of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agentic behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</p>

            <h2>Observation of a generalized Gibbs ensemble in photonics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alvise Bastianello, Alexey Tikan, Francois Copie, Stephane Randoux, Pierre Suret</p>
            <p>In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizing open photon condensates by ghost-attractor dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aya Abouelela, Michael Turaev, Roman Kramer, Moritz Janning, Michael Kajan, Sayak Ray, Johann Kroha</p>
            <p>We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.</p>

            <h2>Non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tigran V. Shahbazyan</p>
            <p>We develop a non-Lorentzian approach for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the exact LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of Maxwell-Bloch equations which describe LSP in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE coupled to the LSP, we obtain an explicit expression for the system effective optical polarizability which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the classical coupled oscillator (CO) model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from the temporal dispersion of metal dielectric function affect dramatically the optical spectra as the system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight is shifted towards the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Magneto-optical Kerr effect in two-dimensional non-collinear antiferromagnetic material HfFeCl6</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Di Zhou, Ning Ding, Haoshen Ye, Shuai Dong, Shan-Shan Wang</p>
            <p>With the development of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is widely used to measure ferromagnetism in 2D systems. Although this effect is usually inactive in antiferromagnets (AFM), recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the presence of MOKE relies on the symmetry of the system and antiferromagnets with noncollinear magnetic order can also induce a significant MOKE signal even without a net magnetization. However, this phenomenon is rarely studied in 2D systems due to a scarcity of appropriate materials hosting noncollinear AFM order. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the HfFeCl6 monolayer with noncollinear Y-AFM ground states, which simultaneously breaks the time-reversal (T) and time-inversion (TI) symmetry, activating the MOKE even though with zero net magnetic moment. In addition, four different MOKE spectra can be obtained in the four permutation states of spin chirality and crystal chirality. The MOKE spectra are switchable when reversing both crystal and spin chirality. Our study provides a material platform to explore the MOKE effect and can potentially be used for electrical readout of AFM states.</p>

            <p>Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional statistics, bridging between fermions and bosons. We propose an experimental setup to measure the statistical angle of topological anyons emitted from a quantum point contact (QPC) source. The setup involves an droplet along a fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, formed by defining a droplet with two negatively biased gates. In the weak tunneling regime, we calculate the charge current, showing its time evolution depends solely on the anyons' statistical properties, with temperature and scaling dimension affecting only the constant prefactor. We compute the cross-correlation between the anyon current transmitted from the source and the current after the junction, providing a direct method to detect anyon braiding statistics.</p>

            <h2>Multi-orbital effects on superconductivity in kagome metals: Parquet renormalization group analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jae-Ho Han, SungBin Lee</p>
            <p>The Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where the electronic density of states diverges due to saddle points in the band structure, play a crucial role in enhancing electronic correlations and driving various instabilities. In particular, VHS-induced superconductivity has earned significant attention due to its potential to achieve high transition temperatures and its tendency to favor exotic pairing states beyond conventional electron-phonon mechanisms. Despite extensive research on VHS-driven superconductivity, the multi-orbital effect on such systems remains less explored. Motivated by recent experiments on several kagome metals under doping and pressure [this http URL {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.B {\bf 103}, 224513 (2021), this http URL {\it et al.}, this http URL. {\bf 14}, 3899 (2023)], we explore the effects of multi-orbital physics and strong correlations induced by VHS in the kagome lattice, focusing on their impact on superconductivity. Using parquet renormalization group analysis, we uncover eight distinct superconducting instabilities, characterized by order parameters with mixed orbital degrees of freedom. Among these, we identify a parameter regime where $d$-wave-like orbital-singlet spin-triplet order parameters dominate as the leading instability. The degenerate spin-triplet states in this regime are capable of breaking time-reversal symmetry, which is a multi-orbital analogue of chiral spin-triplet superconductivity. These findings highlight the interplay between multi-orbital effects on superconductivity and can apply to the kagome metal systems such as $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) family.</p>

            <h2>High-throughput study of kagome compounds in the AV3Sb5 family</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thalis H. B. da Silva, Tiago F. T. Cerqueira, Hai-Chen Wang, Miguel A. L. Marques</p>
            <p>The kagome lattice has emerged as a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena, including superconductivity, charge density waves, and topologically nontrivial states. While AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds have been extensively studied in this context, the broader AB3C5 family remains largely unexplored. In this work, we employ machine-learning-accelerated, high-throughput density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the stability and electronic properties of kagome materials derived from atomic substitutions in the AV3Sb5 structure. We identify 36 promising candidates that are thermodynamically stable, with many more close to the convex hull. Stable compounds are not only found with a pnictogen (Sb or Bi) as the C atom but also with Au, Hg, Tl, and Ce. This diverse chemistry opens the way to tune the electronic properties of the compounds. In fact, many of these compounds exhibit Dirac points, Van Hove singularities, or flat bands close to the Fermi level. Our findings provide an array of compounds for experimental synthesis and further theoretical exploration of kagome superconductors beyond the already known systems.</p>
