            <h2>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Kubo</p>
            <p>This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</p>

            <h2>CaCd$_2$P$_2$: A Visible-Light Absorbing Zintl Phosphide Stable under Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</h2>

            <p>A key bottleneck to solar fuels is the absence of stable and strongly absorbing photoelectrode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Modern approaches generally trade off between stable but weakly absorbing materials, such as wide bandgap oxides, or strongly absorbing materials that rely on encapsulation for stability and are weakly catalytic, such as the III-V family of semiconductors. Of interest are materials like transition metal phosphides, such as FeP$_2$, that are known to undergo beneficial in situ surface transformations in the oxidative environment of OER, though stability has remained a primary hurdle. Here we report on CaCd$_2$P$_2$, a Zintl phase visible-light absorber with favorable 1.6 eV bandgap, that we identified using high-throughput computational screening. Using a combination of photoelectrochemical measurements, microscopy, and spectroscopy, we show that CaCd$_2$P$_2$ undergoes a light-stabilized surface transformation that renders it stable under alkaline OER conditions. We also show that the well known OER catalyst CoPi can act as a stable co-catalyst in synergy with the \textit{in-situ} CaCd$_2$P$_2$ surface. The light-induced stabilization that CaCd$_2$P$_2$ displays is in sharp contrast to the photocorrosion commonly observed in visible light-absorbing photoelectrodes. The broader AM$_2$P$_2$ family of Zintl phases offers a significant opportunity to explore stabilizing interface chemistry and re-design the manner in which low-bandgap semiconductors are used for photoelectrochemical energy conversion.</p>

            <h2>Dimensionality reduction of optically generated vortex strings in a charge density wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajal Dahal, Alex H. Miller, Viktor Krapivin, Gal Orenstein, Ryan A. Duncan, Nicholas Leonard, Matthew J. Hurley, Jade Stanton, Roman Mankowsky, Henrik Lemke, Anisha Singh, Ian Fisher, Mariano Trigo, Samuel W. Teitelbaum</p>
            <p>In phase transitions, mesoscale structures such as topological defects, vortex strings, and domain walls control the path towards equilibrium, and thus the functional properties of many active devices. In photoinduced phase transitions driven by femtosecond laser excitation, the temporal (pulse duration) and spatial (penetration depth) structure of the optical excitation present opportunities for control and creating structures with unique topologies. By performing time-resolved optical pump, x-ray probe experiments on the CDW system Pd-intercalated ErTe$_{3}$, we gain access to the nanoscale dynamics of the mesoscale topological features (vortex strings) produced after a quench, which have a different apparent dimensionality than the topological defects predicted from the bulk system. We show that these vortex strings persist for much longer than the electronic recovery time. The critical exponent obtained from power-law scaling of the intensity as a function of wavevector shows a reduction in the effective dimensionality of the topological defects in the system, corroborated by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway to use light to control the dimensionality and orientation of topological defects in quantum materials, which could be used to stabilize competing quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Surface Topological Quantum Criticality II: Conformal manifolds, Isolated fixed points and Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saran Vijayan, Fei Zhou</p>
            <p>In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite. We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG) flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c \rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open questions and possible future directions.</p>

            <h2>Hard and soft phase slips in a Fabry-Pérot quantum Hall interferometer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N. L. Samuelson, L. A. Cohen, W. Wang, S. Blanch, T. Taniguchi, K. Watanabe, M. P. Zaletel, A. F. Young</p>
            <p>Quantum Hall Fabry-Pérot interferometers are sensitive to the properties of bulk quasiparticles enclosed by the interferometer loop, with the interference phase containing information about both the quasiparticle statistics and the Coulomb-mediated bulk-edge coupling. Previous studies have explored the role of the bulk-edge coupling in an equilibrium picture where quasiparticles enter and exit the interferometer rapidly compared to the timescale over which the interferometer phase is measured. Here, we present data from a monolayer graphene quantum Hall interferometer in the integer quantum Hall regime at $\nu = -1$ and $\nu = -2$. Quantum interference shows phase slips associated with the entrance of quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. Tracing the dependence of these phase slips on the magnetic field, we show that the equilibration time can become as long as several minutes. We further use our multi-gated geometry to identify two classes of phase slips. The first is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle to a bulk `puddle' of quasiparticles uniformly coupled to the entire chiral edge state, while the second is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle trapped by a defect site that couples predominantly to the closest portion of the edge.</p>

            <h2>Evolution from Topological Dirac Metal to Flat-band-Induced Antiferromagnet in Layered KxNi4S2 (0<=x<=1)</h2>

Brown, Hui Wu, Tushar Bhowmick, Tessa McNamee, Ravhi Kumar, Yu-Sheng Chen, Zhi-Li Xiao, Russell Hemley, Weizhao Cai, Shanti Deemyad, Duck-Young Chung, Stephan Rosenkranz, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis</p>
            <p>Condensed matter systems with coexisting Dirac cones and flat bands, and a switchable control between them within a single system, are desirable but remarkably uncommon. Here we report a layered quantum material system, KxNi4S2 (0 <= x <= 1), that simultaneously hosts both characteristics without involving typical Kagome/honeycomb lattices. Enabled by a topochemical K-deintercalation process, the Fermi surface can be fine-tuned continuously over a wide range of energies. Consequently, a non-magnetic Dirac-metal state with a topological nontrivial Z2 index of 1;(000), supported by first-principles calculations and high mobility up to 1471 cm2V-1s-1, is observed on the K-rich x = 1 side, whereas a flat-band induced antiferromagnetic state with TN up to 10.1 K emerges as K-content approaches 0. The KxNi4S2 system offers a versatile platform for exploring emerging phenomena and underscores a viable pathway for in-situ control of quantum materials dominated by Dirac cones, flat bands, and their interplay.</p>

            <h2>Possible Spin Triplet Pairing due to Altermagnetic Spin Fluctuation</h2>

            <p>The interplay between unconventional superconductivity and altermagnetic order has attracted much attentions. In particular, whether spin-triplet superconductivity can be achieved by suppressing altermagnetism remains an open issue. We investigate this issue using a minimal single-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice with vacancy superstructure, in which both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic order can emerge on equal footing. We illustrate the existence of a metallic normal phase with altermagnetism even at half-filling due to the geometric frustration and Coulomb interaction. Suppressing the altermagnetic long-range order using charge doping can lead to both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spin fluctuation. The spin-singlet pairing is always favored when the conventional antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation dominates. However, when the altermagnetic spin fluctuation dominates, spin-triplet pairing may be induced. Implications of our results in possible material candidates are also briefly discussed.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement architecture of beyond-Landau quantum criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Menghan Song, Ting-Tung Wang, Liuke Lyu, William Witczak-Krempa, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>Quantum critical points beyond the Landau paradigm exhibit fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Here, we use entanglement microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and unconventional XY$^*$, and Néel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions. Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling the Role of Solvents in DBTTF:HATCN Ternary Cocrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana M. Valencia, Lisa Schraut-May, Marie Siegert, Sebastian Hammer, Beatrice Cula, Alexandra Friedrich, Holger Helten, Jens Pflaum, Caterina Cocchi, Andreas Opitz</p>
            <p>Donor-acceptor (D:A) cocrystals offer a promising platform for next-generation optoelectronic applications, but the impact of residual solvent molecules on their properties remains an open question. We investigate six novel D:A cocrystals of dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbo-nitrile (HATCN), prepared via solvent evaporation, yielding 1:1 molar ratios, and horizontal vapor deposition, resulting in solvent-free 3:2 cocrystals. Combining spectroscopy and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that, while the electronic and optical properties of the cocrystals are largely unaffected by solvent inclusion, the charge transfer mechanism is surprisingly complex. Raman spectroscopy reveals a consistent charge transfer of 0.11 $e$ across all considered structures, corroborated by DFT calculations on solvent-free systems. Partial charge analysis reveals that in solvated cocrystals, solvent molecules actively participate in the charge transfer process as primary electron acceptors. This involvement can perturb the expected D:A behavior, revealing a faceted charge-transfer mechanism in HATCN even beyond the established involvement of its cyano group. Overall, our study demonstrates that while solution-based methods preserve the intrinsic D:A characteristics, solvents can be leveraged as active electronic components, opening new avenues for material design.</p>

            <h2>Switching magnetic texture via in-plane magnetic field in noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnets: From skyrmions to antiskyrmions and nontopological magnetic bubbles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuki Muto, Masahito Mochizuki</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate field-induced switching of magnetic topology in a nanodisk-shaped sample of noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnet in which the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that stabilizes an antiskyrmion with $N_{\rm sk}$=+1 and the magnetic dipole interaction that stabilizes a skyrmion with $N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$ are in keen competition where $N_{\rm sk}$ is the skyrmion number. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the competition offers a unique opportunity to switch magnetic textures with distinct magnetic topology among the antiskyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=+1), elliptical skyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$), and nontopological bubble ($N_{\rm sk}$=0) in a deterministic manner by application of magnetic fields parallel to the sample plane. By calculating time and spatial profiles of energy contributions from respective interactions and magnetic anisotropy, we clarify the physical mechanism and properties of the observed field-induced topology switching phenomena. Our findings are expected to provide useful insights into the spintronic application of topological magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Radial Rashba spin-orbit fields in commensurate twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Naimer, Paulo E. Faria Junior, Klaus Zollner, Jaroslav Fabian</p>
            <p>In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields can emerge. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general (spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our results offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic disorder in the candidate quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$</h2>

            <p>Quantum spin liquids with long-range entanglement are of great interest for applications in quantum technology. The quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is a promising example, where it is believed that structural disorder plays a key role in enhancing quantum mechanical effects by introducing strains that split the ground state doublet akin to the effect of a local disordered transverse field. However, the precise defect structure responsible for this behaviour is unknown. Here we have determined the intrinsic defect structure of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ using neutron and x-ray scattering techniques supported by density functional theory. We find the main defect is the stuffing of Zr$^{4+}$ sites by Pr$^{3+}$ ions, accompanied by charge compensating O$^{2-}$ vacancies, and the relaxation of a neighbouring O$^{2-}$ ion to an interstitial site. Our results explain the single-ion magnetism by considering the non-magnetic singlets that arise on neighbouring sites as a result of the defect structure. These singlets account for additional features in the crystal electric field excitations. The effects caused by this low level of structural disorder are magnified since several neighbouring Pr sites are affected. This makes a significant contribution towards the observed broadening of pinch points in the magnetic diffuse scattering, which was previously attributed purely to quantum effects.</p>

            <h2>Magnetism Induced by Azanide and Ammonia Adsorption in Defective Molybdenum Disulfide and Diselenide: A First-Principles Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guilherme S. L. Fabris, Bruno Ipaves, Raphael B. Oliveira, Humberto R. Gutierrez, Marcelo L. Pereira Junior, Douglas S. Galvão</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention due to their tunable structural, electronic, and spin-related properties, particularly in the presence of point defects and molecular adsorbates. Motivated by these aspects, we have investigated using first-principles methods the magnetic properties induced by azanide (NH$_2$) and ammonia (NH$_3$) adsorption on defective monolayers of Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS$_2$) and Diselenide(MoSe$_2$). Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of mono- and di-vacancies on the local spin environment and the role of molecular adsorption in modifying magnetic behavior. The results show that pristine chalcogen vacancies do not generate magnetism, whereas the adsorption of NH$_2$ and NH$_3$ creates localized magnetic moments in Mo-based dichalcogenides. A notable case occurs for MoSe$_2$, where NH$_3$ dissociation into NH$_2$ and H fragments on the same side of the surface produces a net magnetic moment of 2.0 $\mu_B$. Tests performed on W-based dichalcogenides under equivalent conditions showed no magnetic response, and are reported here only for comparison. These findings demonstrate that molecular adsorption combined with defect engineering can be a practical approach to tune magnetism in 2D materials, with potential relevance for spintronic and sensing applications.</p>

            <p>The van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr exhibits coupling of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom, giving rise to distinctive quasi-particle interactions. We investigate these interactions across a wide temperature range using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy at various excitation energies, complemented by optical absorption and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy. Under 1.96 eV excitation, we observe pronounced changes in the A$_g^1$, A$_g^2$, and A$_g^3$ Raman modes near the Néel temperature, coinciding with modifications in the oscillator strength of excitonic transitions and clear resonances in PLE. The distinct temperature evolution of Raman tensor elements and polarization anisotropy for Raman modes indicates that they couple to different excitonic and electronic states. The suppression of the excitonic state's oscillation strength above the Néel temperature could be related to the magnetic phase transition, thereby connecting these excitonic states and Raman modes to a specific spin alignment. These observations make CrSBr a versatile platform for probing quasi-particle interactions in low-dimensional magnets and provide insights for applications in quantum sensing and quantum communication.</p>

            <h2>Slow quasiparticle dynamics and anyonic statistics in a fractional quantum Hall Fabry-Pérot interferometer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah L. Samuelson, Liam A. Cohen, Will Wang, Simon Blanch, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Michael P. Zaletel, Andrea F. Young</p>
            <p>Anyons are particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, their exchange statistics can be measured in the edge-state Fabry-Pérot interferometer. In these devices, the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp}\theta_a$ to the interference signal. Here we report the observation of large, hysteretic phase jumps in a monolayer graphene Fabry-Pérot interferometer at $\nu=1/3$. When the filling factor is increased from $\nu<1/3$ towards the center of the plateau, we observe phase slips with magnitude $\Delta \theta \approx 2\pi/3$, consistent with the addition of individual quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, the phase slips occur as instantaneous jumps in the interference signal, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes. We use this long timescale to investigate the effect of changes in interferometer area $A_I$ and $N_{QP}$ independently at fixed magnetic field, revealing a striking memory effect in the phase slip magnitude. In particular, as the $\nu=1/3$ plateau is approached from higher filling, we observed phase slips with $\Delta \theta$ significantly larger than $2\pi/3$ over the same range of gate voltage where quantized jumps are seen for increasing $\nu$. We discuss this asymmetry in terms of bulk-edge coupling of quasiparticles localized near the edge or in the bulk, and argue that this effect can be qualitatively reconciled with theoretical expectations for strongly interacting quasiparticles in the presence of weak disorder and strongly nonequilibrium charge dynamics. Our results highlight the key role played by charge dynamics on signatures of the anyon phase, and demonstrate that fractional quasiparticles can be indefinitely localized in nonequilibrium configurations.</p>

            <h2>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yijie Mo, Xiao-Jiao Wang, Zheng-Yang Zhuang, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Entanglement Generation in the Heterometallic Ni$^\text{2+}_4$Gd$_4^\text{3+}$ Complexes</h2>

            <p>We investigate various types of quantum entanglement in the octanuclear heterometallic $3d/4f$ complexes denoted as Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ under an external magnetic field, using the exact diagonalization approach. These molecular magnets, which can be effectively described by Heisenberg spin models, consist of two identical $\{\text{Ni}^{2+}_2\text{Gd}^{3+}_2\}$ cubane subunits bridged by acetate and hydroxide ligands. Our analysis reveals that their magnetization exhibits intermediate plateaus at low temperatures, indicating distinct ground states characteristic of Ni-containing compounds. Using negativity as a measure of quantum entanglement, we examine the influence of single-ion anisotropy and magnetic field on tetrapartite, bipartite, 1$-$3 tangle, and 2$-$2 tangle entanglements in two families of Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes: $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ without anisotropy and $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ with anisotropy. Complex $\boldsymbol{(1)}$ exhibits strong bipartite entanglement between Ni ions, which persists up to $T \approx 3.0\,\text{K}$ and $B \approx 4.0\,\text{T}$, but shows significantly weaker tetrapartite entanglement and vanishing bipartite entanglement between Gd$\cdots$Gd and Ni$\cdots$Gd pairs. In contrast, complex $\boldsymbol{(2)}$ displays nonzero and sizable values for all types of entanglement considered. These findings emphasis the crucial role of single-ion anisotropy in generating and shaping the entanglement landscape of heterometallic Ni$^{2+}_4$Gd$^{3+}_4$ complexes. Notably, we find that the 1$-$3 tangle entanglement between a Ni ion and the remaining sites in a cubane unit serves as a reliable indicator of ground-state phase transitions, exhibiting distinct changes across phase boundaries irrespective of the presence of single-ion anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovic Gardré, Swen Helstroffer, Pierre Muller, Fabrice Thalmann, Thierry Charitat, Laurent Joly, Claire Loison</p>
            <p>Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity upon dehydration, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics. Finally, the increase of the area per lipid in our tension-free simulations of the fluid membranes hints that the permittivity decrease upon dehydration is concomitant with an intermembrane attraction.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Anisotropy and Absence of Long-Range Order in the Triangular Magnet NdMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</h2>

            <p>The rare-earth triangular-lattice magnet NdMgAl11O19 offers an ideal platform for examining the interplay of crystal electric field effects, geometric frustration, and weak exchange interactions. Using high-quality single crystals, we measured magnetic susceptibility and magnetization down to 1.8 K, while specific heat was measured down to 45 mK. The system exhibits uniaxial anisotropy along the c-axis, with a ground-state Kramers doublet. A Curie-Weiss temperature of -0.38 K indicates weak antiferromagnetic interactions, while a specific heat anomaly at 81 mK suggests weak magnetic correlations with no long-range magnetic order. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK makes it a very interesting material, which is highly frustrated but weakly correlated. Under external fields, the Zeeman splitting of the ground-state doublet leads to a field-tunable Schottky anomaly, with the specific heat peak shifting to 0.65 meV at 3 T, with g ~ 3.7. A Brillouin function fit to magnetization yields g ~ 3.72, confirming the quasi-paramagnetic nature of NdMgAl11O19. These findings highlight NdMgAl11O19 as a promising candidate to investigate quantum spin liquid and exotic spin states in frustrated triangular magnets.</p>

            <h2>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</h2>

            <p>Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $>90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T.M. Kamsma, J.J. Teijema, R. van Roij, C. Spitoni</p>
            <p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are extensively employed for processing sequential data such as time series. Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive platform for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. We accomplish this by employing established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.</p>

            <h2>Demystifying quantum escapism on the honeycomb lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. L. Chernyshev</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Emanant and emergent symmetry-topological-order from low-energy spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zixin Jessie Chen, Ömer M. Aksoy, Cenke Xu, Xiao-Gang Wen</p>
            <p>Low-energy emergent and emanant symmetries can be anomalous, higher-group, or non-invertible. Such symmetries are systematically captured by topological orders in one higher dimension, known as symmetry topological orders (symTOs). Consequently, identifying the emergent or emanant symmetry of a system is not simply a matter of determining its group structure, but rather of computing the corresponding symTO. In this work, we develop a method to compute the symTO of 1+1D systems by analyzing their low-energy spectra under closed boundary conditions with all possible symmetry twists. Applying this approach, we show that the gapless antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model possesses an exact emanant symTO corresponding to the $D_8$ quantum double, when restricted to the $\mathbb{Z}_2^x \times \mathbb{Z}_2^z$ subgroup of the $SO(3)$ spin-rotation symmetry and lattice translations. Moreover, the AF phase exhibits an emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, whose exact components are described jointly by the symTO and the $SO(3)$ spin-rotations. Using condensable algebras in symTO, we further identify several neighboring phases accessible by modifying interactions among low-energy excitations: (1) a gapped dimer phase, connected to the AF phase via an $SO(4)$ rotation, (2) a commensurate collinear ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with a $\omega \sim k^2$ mode, (3) an incommensurate, translation-symmetric ferromagnetic phase featuring both $\omega \sim k^2$ and $\omega \sim k$ modes, connected to the previous phase by an $SO(4)$ rotation, and (4) an incommensurate ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with both $\omega \sim k^2$ and $\omega \sim k$ modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Roberto Verdel, Jean-Yves Desaules, Maksym Serbyn, Marko Ljubotina, Marcello Dalmonte</p>
            <p>Kinetic constraints are generally expected to slow down dynamics in many-body systems, obstructing or even completely suppressing transport of conserved charges. Here, we show how gauge theories can defy this wisdom by yielding constrained models with faster-than-diffusive dynamics. We first show how, upon integrating out the gauge fields, one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theories are exactly mapped onto XX models with non-local constraints. This new class of kinetically constrained models interpolates between free theories and highly constrained local fermionic models. We find that energy transport is superdiffusive over a broad parameter regime. Even more drastically, spin transport exhibits ballistic behavior, albeit with anomalous finite-volume properties as a consequence of gauge invariance. Our findings are relevant to current efforts in quantum simulations of gauge-theory dynamics and anomalous hydrodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) is an emergent platform for exploring exotic quantum phases driven by the interplay between nontrivial band topology and strong electron correlations. Direct experimental access to its momentum-resolved electronic structure is essential for uncovering the microscopic origins of the correlated topological phases therein. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of tMoTe$_2$, revealing pronounced twist-angle-dependent band reconstruction shaped by orbital character, interlayer coupling, and moiré potential modulation. Density functional theory (DFT) captures the qualitative evolution, yet underestimates key energy scales across twist angles, highlighting the importance of electronic correlations. Notably, the hole effective mass at the K point exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on twist angle, peaking near 2°, consistent with band flattening at the magic angle predicted by continuum models. Via electrostatic gating and surface dosing, we further visualize the evolution of electronic structure versus doping, enabling direct observation of the conduction band minimum and confirm tMoTe$_2$ as a direct band gap semiconductor. These results establish a spectroscopic foundation for modeling and engineering emergent quantum phases in this moiré platform.</p>

            <h2>Gain-driven magnon-polariton dynamics in the ultrastrong coupling regime: Effective circuit approach for coherence versus nonlinearity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryunosuke Suzuki, Takahiro Chiba, Hiroaki Matsueda</p>
            <p>We theoretically study the dynamics of gain-driven magnon-polaritons (MPs), which characterizes auto-oscillation of MPs, across the strong coupling (SC) and ultrastrong coupling (USC) regimes. Taking into account the magnon dynamics via the magnetic flux, we present an effective circuit model of gain-driven MPs, which allows to manipulate the coupling strength of MPs by tuning the size of a ferromagnet and incorporates the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons due to the shape magnetic anisotropy. In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr nonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon coupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent magnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also effectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies, resulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one to widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic field. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the coupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons. This work is attributed to understanding of the interplay between gain-loss and USC in nonlinear polariton dynamics, offering a novel principle for frequency tunable maser-like devices based on gain-driven MPs.</p>

            <p>Infinite-layer nickelate superconductors are typically synthesized as thin films and thus include, besides the more bulk-like inner layers, distinct surface and interface layers in contact with the vacuum and substrate, respectively. Here, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to investigate how electronic correlations influence these surface and interface regions. Our results show that electronic correlations can significantly modify the electronic structure, even driving surface layers into a Mott-insulating state with a 3$d^8$ electronic configuration. Moreover, surface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\Gamma$ and $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound NdNiO$_2$. Finally, for an $n$-type interface, often synthesized experimentally, we find the Ti 3$d$ orbitals to become electron doped.</p>

            <p>We investigate the magnetization and the magnetostriction of the dipole-octupole quantum spin ice candidate Ce2Hf2O7 down to 50 mK. We find that the magnetization curves observed with the magnetic field applied along all the principal axes ([100], [110], and [111]) exhibit a magnetic hysteresis below around 300 mK. In addition, a kink-like feature is observed in the magnetization under B || [111], at which the magnetostriction also shows a convex field dependence. Our classical Monte-Carlo and quantum exact diagonalization calculations demonstrate that these features in the magnetization are well reproduced by the spin Hamiltonian with a dominant interaction between the octupole moments and with a QSI ground state, indicating the emergence of a dipole-octupole QSI in this compound.</p>

            <p>We study the classical dipole-octupole pyrochlore spin systems in an external magnetic field along the $[111]$ direction. We identify an intermediate fragmented spin liquid phase that precedes full spin saturation, characterized by the coexistence of three phenomena: U(1) spin liquid on the Kagome planes, spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking, and partial spin polarization from explicit symmetry breaking. We show that even without dipolar interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks. We discuss how these discoveries are directly relevant to various experiments on dipole-octupole pyrochlore materials, including neutron scattering, magnetization, and magnetostriction.</p>

            <p>2D van der Waals ferromagnets hold immense promise for spintronic applications due to their controllability and versatility. Despite their significance, the realization and in-depth characterization of ferromagnetic materials in atomically thin single layers, close to the true 2D limit, has been scarce. Here, a successful synthesis of monolayer (ML) 1T-CrTe2 is reported on a bilayer graphene (BLG) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, that the ferromagnetic transition is observed at the Curie temperature (TC) of 150 K in ML 1T-CrTe2 on BLG, accompanied by unconventional temperature-dependent band evolutions. The spectroscopic analysis and first-principle calculations reveal that the ferromagnetism may arise from Goodenough-Kanamori super-exchange and double-exchange interactions, enhanced by the lattice distortion and the electron doping from the BLG substrate. These findings provide pivotal insight into the fundamental understanding of mechanisms governing 2D ferromagnetism and offer a pathway for engineering higher TC in 2D materials for future spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results agree well with experiments and establish a framework for predicting large phonon magnetism in magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon coupling. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.</p>

            <p>Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moiré semiconductors can be used to realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moiré valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in this moiré semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's moiré valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$ in the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole filling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moiré honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave.</p>

In spite of the large size difference and the vastly different experimental schemes used to extract \k{appa}xx, we find in large part that both experiments yield similar results and conclude that the bulk of FQH states thermally conducts and violate the Wiedemann-Franz law by a wide margin. Slight discrepancies between both studies are further discussed in terms of particle-hole symmetry in the vicinity of the 5/2 and 7/3 FQH states.</p>

            <p>The search for intrinsic excitonic insulators (EI) has long been confounded by coexisting electron-phonon coupling in bulk materials. Although the ground state of an EI may be difficult to differentiate from density-wave orders or other structural instabilities, excited states offer distinctive signatures. One way to provide clarity is to directly inspect the phonon spectral function for long wavelength broadening due to phonon interaction with the high velocity EI phason. Here, we report that the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) EI candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ shows extremely anisotropic phonon broadening and softening in the semimetallic normal state. In contrast, such a behavior is completely absent in the broken symmetry state of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and in the isostructural Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, where the latter has a fully gapped normal state. By contrasting the expected phonon lifetimes in the BCS and BEC limits of a putative EI, our results suggest that the phase transition in Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ family is closely related to strong interband electron-phonon coupling. We experimentally determine the dimensionless coupling $\frac{g}{\omega_0}\sim10$, showing Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ as a rare "ultra-strong coupling" material.</p>

            <p>A clean interface between two Weyl semimetals features a universal, field-linear tunnel magnetoconductance of $(e^2/h)N_\mathrm{ho}$ per magnetic flux quantum, where $N_\mathrm{ho}$ is the number of chirality-preserving topological interface Fermi arcs. In this work we show that the linearity of the magnetoconductance is robust with to interface disorder. The slope of the magnetoconductance changes at a characteristic field strength $B_\mathrm{arc}$ -- the field strength for which the time taken to traverse the Fermi arc due to the Lorentz force is equal to the mean inter-arc scattering time. For fields much larger than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the magnetoconductance is unaffected by disorder. For fields much smaller than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the slope is no longer determined by $N_\mathrm{ho}$ but by the simple fraction $N_\mathrm{L} N_\mathrm{R}/(N_\mathrm{L}+N_\mathrm{R})$, where $N_\mathrm{L}$ and $N_\mathrm{R}$ are the numbers of Weyl-node pairs in the left and right Weyl semimetal, respectively. We also consider the effect of spatially correlated disorder potentials, where we find that $B_\mathrm{arc}$ decreases exponentially with increasing correlation length. Our results provide a possible explanation for the recently observed robustness of the negative linear magnetoresistance in grained Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Ziereis, Sanjay Moudgalya, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Mixed states can exhibit two distinct kinds of symmetries, either on the level of the individual states (strong symmetry), or only on the level of the ensemble (weak symmetry). Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to weak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric density matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric random quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site representation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be regarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to more general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak postselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order transition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly symmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases and their transitions for both abelian $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$ symmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with measurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent in the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum channels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the degeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results demonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of noisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds of mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time String Dynamics in a $2+1$D Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory: String Breaking, Glueball Formation, Baryon Blockade, and Tension Reduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Cataldi, Simone Orlando, Jad C. Halimeh</p>
            <p>Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.</p>

            <h2>Fast simulation of fermions with reconfigurable qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nishad Maskara, Marcin Kalinowski, Daniel Gonzalez-Cuadra, Mikhail D. Lukin</p>
            <p>Performing large-scale, accurate quantum simulations of many-fermion systems is a central challenge in quantum science, with applications in chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics. Despite significant progress, realizing generic fermionic algorithms with qubit systems incurs significant space-time overhead, scaling as O(N) for N fermionic modes. Here we present a method for faster fermionic simulation with asymptotic space-time overhead of O(log(N)) in the worst case, and O(1) for circuits with additional structure, including important subroutines like the fermionic fast Fourier transform. This exponential reduction is achieved by using reconfigurable quantum systems with non-local connectivity, mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedforward, to generate dynamical fermion-to-qubit mappings. We apply this technique to achieve efficient compilation for key simulation tasks, including Hamiltonian simulation of the sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and periodic materials, as well as free-fermion state-preparation. Moreover, we show that the algorithms themselves can be adapted to use only the O(1)-overhead structures to further reduce resource overhead. These techniques can lower gate counts by orders of magnitude for practical system sizes and are natively compatible with error corrected computation, making them ideal for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. Our results tightly bound the computational gap between fermionic and qubit models and open new directions in quantum simulation algorithm design and implementation.</p>

            <p>We develop a systematic projector-based Feynman diagram framework that intrinsically encodes quantum geometry for nonlinear optical responses. By explicitly incorporating geometric quantities such as the quantum geometric tensor, quantum hermitian connection, and triple phase product, the method ensures component-wise gauge invariance and seamlessly extends to multiband systems, enabling accurate calculations of quantum geometry and nonlinear optical responses. We derive the projector formalism in Wannier function basis and implement the \textit{ab initio} calculations of shift current in GeS, demonstrating excellent agreement with the sum rule and Wilson loop approaches. This work extends projector-based representations within the Wannier functions basis, offering an efficient and reliable tool for investigating nonlinear light-matter interactions and quantum geometry in realistic materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melchi Chosenyah, Swaraj Rajaram, Vladimir Novikov, Anton Maydykovskiy, Ankur Khapre, Tatiana Murzina, Rajadurai Chandrasekar</p>
            <p>This work demonstrates the multifaceted dynamic motion and three-dimensional (3D) spatial manipulation of organic micro ring resonators (MRRs). The MRRs are fabricated via surface-tension-assisted self-assembly of 2,2'-((1E,1'E)-hydrazine-1,2-diylidenebis(methaneylylidene))bis(3,5-dibromophenol) (HDBP), exhibiting nonlinear optical (NLO) emission and frequency comb-type whispering gallery modes. Interestingly, the MRRs are micromechanically reconfigurable into various strained architectures, including lifting, transferring, vertical standing, axial spinning, and wheel-like rolling, using an atomic force microscopy cantilever tip. The MRRs retained their photonic traits throughout these dynamic motions, underscoring their mechanical robustness. Notably, the demonstration of axial spinning and rolling locomotion extends the manipulation capabilities beyond two-dimensional control, enabling complete 3D spatial control. These results establish a foundational platform for next-generation NLO mechanophotonic systems, where reconfigurable smart and soft photonic elements can be dynamically controlled with high spatial precision.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Electric Field and Zitterbewegung on a Photonic Frequency Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu Yang, Bengy Tsz Tsun Wong, Yi Yang</p>
            <p>The synthetic frequency dimension, which realizes fictitious spatial dimensions from the spectral degree of freedom, has emerged as a promising platform for engineering artificial gauge fields in studying quantum simulations and topological physics with photons. A current central task for frequency-domain photons is the creation and manipulation of nontrivial non-Abelian field strength tensors and observing their governing dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a miniaturized scheme for creating non-Abelian electric fields in a photonic frequency chain using a polarization-multiplexed, time-modulated ring resonator. By engineering spin-orbit coupling via modulation dephasing, polarization rotation, and polarization retardation, we achieve programmable control over synthetic Floquet bands and their quasimomentum spin-resolved textures. Leveraging self-heterodyne coherent detection, we demonstrate Zitterbewegung -- a trembling motion of photons -- induced by non-Abelian electric fields on the frequency chain. We further observe the interference between Zitterbewegung and Bloch oscillations arising from the coexistence of non-Abelian and Abelian electric fields. Our work bridges synthetic dimensions with non-Abelian gauge theory for versatile photonic emulation of relativistic quantum mechanics and spinor dynamics, and can be instrumental in applications like frequency-domain optical computation and multimodal frequency comb control.</p>

            <h2>On the role of water activity on the formation of a protein-rich coffee ring in an evaporating multicomponent drop</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Martínez-Puig, Gianluca D'Agostino, Ana Oña, Javier Rodríguez-Rodríguez</p>
            <p>The coffee-ring effect is a universal feature of evaporating sessile droplets with pinned contact line, wherein solutes or particles are advected to the droplet's edge due to evaporation-driven flows. While existing models have successfully described this phenomenon in particle-laden droplets, they often assume that hydrodynamics are decoupled from solute transport. This assumption breaks down in complex fluids, such as protein or polymeric solutions, where the solute can influence evaporation through changes in water activity. Here, we investigate model respiratory droplets primarily composed of water, salt, and a type of the glycoprotein mucin. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observe the formation of a well-defined protein ring at the droplet edge as water evaporates. The growth and morphology of this ring exhibit a strong dependence on ambient relative humidity ($H_r$), revealing dynamics that existing models cannot capture. Specifically, we find that protein accumulation at the edge is governed by the feedback between local solute concentration and evaporation rate. To account for this, we develop a minimal theoretical model based on the lubrication approximation, incorporating the coupling between hydrodynamics and solute transport through the evaporation rate. Our framework reproduces key features of the experimental observations and suggests a physical basis for the $H_r$-dependent stability and infectivity of respiratory droplets containing viruses.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that open quantum systems exhibiting dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) allow for highly efficient protocols implementing the Pontus-Mpemba effect. The relaxation speed-up toward a predesignated target state is tied to the existence of a long metastable time window preceding the DPT and can be exploited in applications to systematically optimize quantum protocols. As paradigmatic example for the connection between DPTs and quantum Mpemba effects, we study one-dimensional (1D) interacting lattice fermions corresponding to a dissipative variant of the Gross-Neveu model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. V. Vovchenko, A. A. Zyablovsky, A. A. Pukhov, E. S. Andrianov</p>
            <p>Linear operations, e.g., vector-matrix or vector-vector multiplications, are core operations of modern neural networks. To diminish computational time, these operations are implemented by parallel computations using different coprocessors. In this work we show that open quantum system consisting of bosonic modes and interacting with bosonic reservoirs can be used as analog coprocessor implementing multiple vector-matrix multiplications with stochastic matrices in parallel. Input vectors are encoded in occupancies of reservoirs, and output result is presented by stationary energy flows. The operation takes time needed for the system's transition to non-equilibrium stationary state independently on number of the reservoirs, i.e., on the input vector dimension. The computations are accompanied by entropy growth. We construct a direct mapping between open quantum systems and electrical crossbar structures, showing that dissipation rates multiplied by OQS's modes frequencies can be seen as conductivities, reservoirs' occupancies can be seen as potentials, and stationary energy flows can be seen as electric currents.</p>

            <h2>Ergotropic advantage in a measurement-fueled quantum heat engine</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sidhant Jakhar, Ramandeep S. Johal</p>
            <p>This paper investigates a coupled two-qubits heat engine fueled by generalized measurements of the spin components and using a single heat reservoir as sink. Our model extends the four-stroke engine proposed by Yi and coworkers [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 96}, 022108 (2017)] by introducing an ergotropy-extracting stroke, resulting in a five-stroke cycle. For measurements along z-z directions, we find two possible occupation distributions that yield an active state and the ergotropic stroke improves the performance of the engine over the four-stroke cycle. Further, the three-stroke engine (without the adiabatic strokes) yields the same performance as the five-stroke engine. For arbitrary working medium and non-selective measurements, we prove that the total work output of a five-stroke engine is equal to the sum of the work outputs of the corresponding four-stroke and three-stroke engines. For measurement directions other than z-z, there may be many possible orderings of the post-measurement probabilities that yield an active state. However, as we illustrate for specific cases (x-x and x-z directions), a definite ordering is obtained with the projective measurements. Thus, we find that the five-stroke engine exploiting ergotropy outperforms both its four-stroke as well as three-stroke counterparts.</p>

            <p>We report cross-validated measurements of the isotope effect on dielectric relaxation for four isotopologues of ice and water, including the 1-10^5 Hz region, in which only sporadic and inconsistent measurements were previously available. In ice, the relaxation rates exhibit an activated temperature dependence with an isotope-independent activation energy. Across 248-273 K, the H_2O/D_2O relaxation rate ratio remains constant at 2.0 \pm 0.1. This scaling agrees with Kramers' theory in the high-friction limit if the moving mass is the proton or deuteron, indicating that dielectric relaxation is governed by a classic proton transfer over an energy barrier rather than molecular reorientation.</p>

            <p>We develop a framework for non-Markovian SIR and SIS models beyond mean field, utilizing the continuous-time random walk formalism. Using a gamma distribution for the infection and recovery inter-event times as a test case, we derive asymptotical late-time master equations with effective memory kernels and obtain analytical predictions for the final outbreak size distribution in the SIR model, and quasistationary distribution and disease lifetime in the SIS model. We show that increasing memory can greatly widen the outbreak size distribution and reduce the disease lifetime. We also show that rescaled Markovian models fail to capture fluctuations in the non-Markovian case. Overall, our findings, confirmed against numerical simulations, demonstrate that memory strongly shapes epidemic dynamics and paves the way for extending such analyses to structured populations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcel Ernst, Riccardo Rossetto, David Zwicker</p>
            <p>Chromosomal crossovers play a crucial role in meiotic cell division, as they ensure proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic variability. Experiments have consistently revealed two key observations across species: (i) the number of crossovers per chromosome is typically small, but at least one, and (ii) crossovers on the same chromosome are subject to interference, i.e., they are more separated than expected by chance. These observations can be explained by a recently proposed coarsening model, where the dynamics of droplets associated with chromosomes designate crossovers. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the coarsening model, which we also extend by including material exchanges between droplets, the synaptonemal complex, and the nucleoplasm. We derive scaling laws for the crossover count, which allows us to analyze data across species. Moreover, our model provides a coherent explanation of experimental data across mutants, including the wild-type and zyp1-mutant of A. thaliana. Consequently, the extended coarsening model provides a solid framework for investigating the underlying mechanisms of crossover placement.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and quantum criticality gives rise to the notion of symmetry-enriched criticality, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, its non-Hermitian counterpart remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Work statistics of sudden Quantum quenches: A random matrix theory perspective on Gaussianity and its deviations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Tierz</p>
            <p>We show that, for sudden quenches, the work distribution reduces to the statistics of traces of powers of Haar unitaries, which are random unitary matrices drawn uniformly from the unitary group. For translation-invariant quadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and periodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary matrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the form $W=\sum_{r\le m} a_r\,\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ (and in models with pairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional $b_r\,\mathrm{Im}\,\mathrm{Tr}\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate central limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian distribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\mathrm{Var}(W)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_r r\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers. We also characterise the conditions under which non-Gaussian tails arise, for example from many interaction terms or their slow decay, as well as the appearance of Fisher--Hartwig singularities. We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain. Various numerical diagnostics support the analytical results.</p>

            <h2>Orientational dynamics governs the pathways of entropic crystallization of Brownian squares</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debojit Chanda, Thomas G. Mason, Manas Khan</p>
            <p>In dense systems of hard-interacting colloidal particles having anisotropic shapes, crystallization pathways represent an interesting frontier. The translational and rotational dynamics of such particles become coupled at higher densities, resulting in complex kinetics of their configurational ordering. To elucidate this, we have studied a two-dimensional entropic system of osmotically compressed corner-rounded Brownian square platelets. By analyzing the translational and orientational dynamics of the particles and their respective contributions toward minimizing the free energy, we show that the range of accessible orientational states of the particles principally governs the pathways of structural evolution, as the orientational entropy dictates the minimization of the free energy and, hence, the resulting optimal equilibrium ordering. When the particles have access to a wider range of orientational states, the larger rotational component of configurational entropy minimizes the total free energy, leading to hexagonal ordering. At higher osmotic pressures, the long collective translational fluctuations of the side-aligned particles with restricted rotational fluctuations maximize the entropy with a greater contribution from the translational component, thereby inducing a free energetically favored rhombic crystalline structure. We further show that density influences the crystallization pathways indirectly by setting an upper bound on the range of accessible orientational states. Complementary Brownian dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations further corroborate our findings, and their generalizability is demonstrated using a system of triangular particles. Thus, orientational dynamics is predicted to play a crucial role in governing the pathways for entropic ordering of various anisotropic shapes.</p>

            <p>Weyl semimetals host topologically protected surface states, the so-called Fermi arcs, that have a penetration depth into the bulk that depends on surface-momentum, and diverges at the Weyl points. It has recently been observed in PtBi$_2$ that such Fermi arc states can become superconducting, with a critical temperature larger than that of the bulk. Here we introduce a general variational method that captures the interplay between surface and bulk superconductivity, for any bulk Hamiltonian that harbors (topological) surface states with varying penetration depth. From the self-consistent solutions we establish that the surface state localization length of Weyl semimetals leads to characteristic features in the surface superconductivity, with a gap depending on surface momentum and a penetration length for the order parameter that is temperature-dependent due to competition with the bulk superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of external magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$ Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for the driving force underlying spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or unphysically enhanced spin--orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results provide a new perspective that offers a unifying framework with the potential to reconcile many existing hypotheses and theoretical models, while also suggesting several testable predictions that can be examined experimentally.</p>

            <p>Ferromagnetic pyrochlore and spinel materials with topological flat bands are of interest for their potential to exhibit a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE). In this work, we present computational predictions of stability and electronic structure for 448 compositions within the pyrochlore (A2B2O7) and spinel (AB2O4) frameworks. Of these, 92 are predicted to be thermodynamically stable or close (< 100 meV/atom) to the convex hull, with trends deviating from expectations based on ionic radius-ratio rules. Thirteen are predicted to adopt a ferromagnetic ground state among the collinear configurations considered. Two additional materials meeting these criteria were also identified from open materials databases. Calculations of anomalous Hall angles (AHA) and conductivities reveal that 11 of the screened materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications requiring high electronic conductivity and a giant AHE. Our results suggest that the AHA can be further enhanced by tuning the Fermi level, for example through chemical doping. Using this approach, we identify five materials whose AHA exceed 0.2 under the approximation of collinear magnetism. Notably, Ag2Pt2O7 exhibits a high AHA of 0.405 when its Fermi level is optimized. These findings provide a roadmap for the targeted synthesis of new pyrochlore and spinel compounds with enhanced AHE properties. They also broaden the compositional design space for these structures and support the discovery of high-performance materials for next-generation spintronic applications.</p>

The workflow is validated on Mg-Ca-H ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary systems by exploring nearly 10 million configurations, demonstrating substantial speedup compared to first-principles calculations.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shunichi Saito, Sooyeon Kim, Yuichi Taniguchi, Miho Yanagisawa</p>
            <p>Colloidal gels gradually evolve as their structures reorganize, a process known as aging. Understanding this behavior is essential for fundamental science and practical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering. This study examines the aging of low-concentration Laponite suspensions with varying salt concentrations using fluorescence microscopy, scattering imaging, and particle tracking microrheology. Structural heterogeneity appeared earlier at higher salt concentrations, and the average size of aggregates decreased as the salt concentration increased further. Fourier transform analysis corroborated these trends, and scattering images showed similar results. Microrheology revealed distinct dynamics in Laponite-rich and Laponite-poor regions: the poor phase exhibited liquid-like behavior, while the rich phase exhibited gel-like properties. Further analysis suggested the presence of submicron or nanoscale structural heterogeneities within the rich phase.

            <h2>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Aguilera, Sosuke Ito, Artemy Kolchinsky</p>
            <p>We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</p>

            <h2>Integrability of the Kondo model with time dependent interaction strength</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parameshwar R. Pasnoori</p>
            <p>In this letter we consider the time dependent Kondo model where a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons through a time dependent interaction strength $J(t)$. We develop a new framework based on Bethe ansatz and construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation which relates the amplitudes corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles in the configuration space. This constraint equation takes the form of a matrix difference equation, and the associated consistency conditions restrict the interaction strength $J(t)$ for the system to be integrable. For a given $J(t)$ satisfying these constraints, the solution to the matrix difference equations provides the exact many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We provide a concrete example of $J(t)$ which satisfies these constraint equations. We show that in this case, the matrix difference equations turn into quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations, which are well studied in the literature. The framework developed in this work allows one to probe the non-equilibrium physics of the Kondo model, and being general, it also allows one to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Bohm, Hugo Gerlitz, Christina Jörg, Michael Fleischhauer</p>
            <p>One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-mediated intrinsic topological superconductivity in Fermi arcs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Mæland, Masoud Bahari, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>We propose that phonons can intrinsically mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we find that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a range of chemical potentials around the Weyl nodes. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave Cooper pairing in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we find a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the Fermi arcs, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</p>

            <h2>Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie</p>
            <p>We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maitê Kessler de Azambuja, David Möckli</p>
            <p>In nonreciprocal superconductors, inversion and time-reversal symmetries are absent, which may be broken extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts a nonreciprocal superconducting state of the axionic subtype, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures that exhibit topological stability, which, along with novel thermal and electrical transport properties, make them the ideal candidates for a variety of novel technological applications. Accessing the skyrmion spin texture at the nanoscale and understanding its interaction with local thermal gradients is essential for engineering skyrmion-based transport phenomena. However, direct experimental insight into the local thermoelectric response of single skyrmions remains limited. To address this, we employ scanning thermoelectric microscopy~(SThEM) to probe the nanoscale thermoelectric response from a single skyrmion. By mapping the local thermoelectric voltage with nanoscale precision, we reveal a unique spatially resolved response that is the convolution of the underlying spin texture of the skyrmion and its interaction with the highly localised thermal gradient originating from the heated probe. We combine this with thermoelectric modelling of a range of skyrmion spin textures to reveal unique thermoelectric responses and allow the possibility of SThEM to be used as a tool to distinguish nanoscale spin textures. These findings provide fundamental insights into the interaction of topologically protected spin textures with local thermal gradients and the resultant spin transport. We demonstrate a novel route to characterise nanoscale spin textures, accelerating the material optimisation cycle, while also opening the possibility to harness skyrmions for spin caloritronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Yu, Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Jin-Zhu Zhao, Philippe Ghosez</p>
            <p>Driven by novel approaches and computational techniques, second-principles atomic potentials are nowadays at the forefront of computational materials science, enabling large-scale simulations of material properties with near-first-principles accuracy. However, their application to polar materials can be challenging, particularly when longitudinal-optical phonon modes are active on the material, as accurately modeling such systems requires incorporating the long-range part of the dipole-dipole interactions. In this study, we challenge the influence of these interactions on the properties of polar materials taking BaTiO$_3$ as paradigmatic example. By comparing models with and without the long-range part of the electrostatic contributions in a systematic way, we demonstrate that even if these interactions are neglected, the models can still provide an overall good description of the material, though they may lead to punctual significant artifacts. Our results propose a pathway to identify when an atomistic potential may be inadequate and needs to be corrected through the inclusion of the long-range part of dipolar interactions.</p>

            <p>We studied the long-term nonequilibrium dynamics of $q$-state Potts models with $q=4$, $5$, $6$, and $8$ using Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional square lattice. When the contact energies between the nearest neighbors for the standard Potts models are used, cyclic changes in the $q$ homogeneous phases and $q$-state coexisting wave mode appear at low and high flipping energies, respectively, for all values of $q$. However, for a factorizable $q$ value, dynamic modes with skipping states emerge, depending on the contact energies. For $q=6$, a spiral wave mode with three domain types (one state dominant or two states mixed) and cyclic changes in three homogeneous phases are found. Although three states can coexist spatially under thermal equilibrium, the scaling exponents of the transitions to the wave modes are modified from the equilibrium values.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Knotz, Till M. Muenker, Timo Betz, Matthias Krüger</p>
            <p>The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.</p>

This review article focuses on the theory and experimental studies of rubber friction on substrates with random roughness. We examine both steady sliding and accelerated motion, with particular attention to the origins of the breakloose friction force and the influence of pre-slip, elasticity, and flash temperature on friction dynamics. We further discuss rolling friction for cylinders and spheres, as well as sliding friction for triangular sliders on dry and lubricated rubber surfaces. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results obtained using different materials, geometries, and environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of accounting for multiscale roughness. Open challenges, such as the role of adhesion enhancement, energy dissipation due to crack opening, and the physical origin of the short-distance roughness cut-off, are discussed.</p>

            <p>The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The range of the relaxation time is observed to decrease as the temperature increases.</p>

            <p>By means of an integral experimental and $ab$ $initio$/DFT approach we contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects (ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$ angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In (EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process has stopped. In this work we show that in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed, the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and check experimentally the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by Bäverstam et al. and by Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in $^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity. The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the $^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.</p>

            <p>Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the {\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner. In contrast, the top of the {\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films. Our findings expand the family of ambient-pressure nickelate superconductors and establish a connection between structural configuration, electronic structure, and the emergence of superconductivity in nickelates.</p>

            <p>We propose a generalized composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) by adapting the quantum mechanics approach of CFs. The theoretical framework naturally produces an effective CF Hamiltonian and a wavefunction ansatz, and the Bloch band characteristics of FCIs determine effective scalar and vector potentials experienced by CFs. Our analysis clarifies the construction of CF wavefunctions and state counting in CF phase space, which is subject to a density-of-states correction for filling factors $|\nu| \neq 1/2$. We apply the theory to study the $\nu=-2/3$ FCI state of the twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system, modeling it as either a $1/3$-filled electron band or a $2/3$-filled hole band. While both CF models exhibit trends and features consistent with exact diagonalization results, the electron-based model shows better agreement. Furthermore, we find that the FCI phase transition coincides with a topological phase transition in unoccupied CF $\Lambda$-bands.</p>

More importantly, in such layered antiferromagnets, the magnon nonreciprocity exhibits an asymmetric periodic dependence on the Neel vector, offering a novel route for experimentally probing antiferromagnetic order parameters in the 2D limit.</p>

We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function.

The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing.

            <p>The paths of swift heavy ions are typically traceable in solids, because of confined electronic interactions along the paths, inducing what is known in literature as 'ion tracks', i.e. nano-sized in cross-section cylindrical zones of modified material extending for microns in length. Such tracks readily form in materials exhibiting low thermal conductivities, in particular insulators or semiconductors, altering the homogeneity of materials. In this work, using recently discovered gamma/beta-Ga2O3 polymorph heterostructures we show that, in contrast to the trends in many other materials, including that in beta-Ga2O3, swift heavy ions leave no tracks in gamma-Ga2O3. We explained this trend in terms of amazingly fast disorder recovery, occurring because of multiple configurations in the gamma-Ga2O3 lattice itself, so that the disorder formed by ion impacts gets rapidly erased, giving a perception of ions leaving no tracks. As such, gamma-Ga2O3, readily integrated with beta-Ga2O3 in polymorph heterostructures, may become a promising semiconductor platform for devices capable to operate in extremely harsh radiation environments.</p>

            <p>The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials.</p>

We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Kuo Chen, Arnab Sen, Qiang Wu</p>
            <p>Spin glass models with quadratic-type Hamiltonians are disordered statistical physics systems with competing ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin interactions. The corresponding Gibbs measures belong to the exponential family parametrized by (inverse) temperature $\beta>0$ and external field $h\in\mathbb{R}$. Given a sample from these Gibbs measures, a statistically fundamental question is to infer the temperature and external field parameters. In 2007, Chatterjee (Ann. Statist. 35 (2007), no.5, 1931-1946) first proved that in the absence of external field $h=0$, the maximum pseudolikelihood estimator for $\beta$ is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent under some mild assumptions on the disorder matrices. It was left open whether the same method can be used to estimate the temperature and external field simultaneously. In this paper, under some easily verifiable conditions, we prove that the bivariate maximum pseudolikelihood estimator is indeed jointly $\sqrt{N}$-consistent for the temperature and external field parameters. The examples cover the classical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and its diluted variants.</p>

            <h2>Adaptive kernel predictors from feature-learning infinite limits of neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clarissa Lauditi, Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
            <p>Previous influential work showed that infinite width limits of neural networks in the lazy training regime are described by kernel machines. Here, we show that neural networks trained in the rich, feature learning infinite-width regime in two different settings are also described by kernel machines, but with data-dependent kernels. For both cases, we provide explicit expressions for the kernel predictors and prescriptions to numerically calculate them. To derive the first predictor, we study the large-width limit of feature-learning Bayesian networks, showing how feature learning leads to task-relevant adaptation of layer kernels and preactivation densities. The saddle point equations governing this limit result in a min-max optimization problem that defines the kernel predictor. To derive the second predictor, we study gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight decay in the infinite-width limit using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The fixed point equations of the arising DMFT defines the task-adapted internal representations and the kernel predictor. We compare our kernel predictors to kernels derived from lazy regime and demonstrate that our adaptive kernels achieve lower test loss on benchmark datasets.</p>

            <h2>Representation of tensor functions using lower-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Madadi, Lin Cheng, Pu Zhang</p>
            <p>The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</p>

            <h2>Crack Path Prediction with Operator Learning using Discrete Particle System data Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elham Kiyani, Venkatesh Ananchaperumal, Ahmad Peyvan, Mahendaran Uchimali, Gang Li, George Em Karniadakis</p>
            <p>Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.</p>

            <p>We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs. Focusing on a simple kind of fermionic fusion 2-category described purely by group theoretical data, our results reveal that by allowing for stacking with $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_1$ as an equivalence relation enables a finite set of inequivalent modifications to the original fusion 2-categorical-symmetry. To put our results in a broader context, we relate the order of the symmetry modifications to the image of a map between groups of minimal nondegenerate extensions, and to the tangential structure set by the initial categorical symmetry on the background manifold for the QFT.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Spin Chains at Criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijun Wei, Mingdi Xu, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Haiping Hu, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the Rényi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henning Schlömer, Annabelle Bohrdt</p>
            <p>As ultracold atom experiments become highly controlled and scalable quantum simulators, they require sophisticated control over high-dimensional parameter spaces and generate increasingly complex measurement data that need to be analyzed and interpreted efficiently. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been established as versatile tools for addressing these challenges, offering strategies for data interpretation, experimental control, and theoretical modeling. In this review, we provide a perspective on how machine learning is being applied across various aspects of quantum simulation, with a focus on cold atomic systems. Emphasis is placed on practical use cases -- from classifying many-body phases to optimizing experimental protocols and representing quantum states -- highlighting the specific contexts in which different ML approaches prove effective. Rather than presenting algorithmic details, we focus on the physical insights enabled by ML and the kinds of problems in quantum simulation where these methods offer tangible benefits.</p>

            <h2>Critical Majorana fermion at a topological quantum Hall bilayer transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cristian Voinea, Wei Zhu, Nicolas Regnault, Zlatko Papić</p>
            <p>Quantum Hall bilayers are a uniquely tunable platform that can realize continuous transitions between distinct topological phases of matter. One prominent example is the transition between the Halperin state and the Moore--Read Pfaffian, long predicted to host a critical theory of Majorana fermions but so far not verified in unbiased microscopic simulations. Using the fuzzy sphere regularization, we identify the low-energy spectrum at this transition with the 3D gauged Majorana conformal field theory. We show that the transition is driven by the closing of the neutral fermion gap, and we directly extract the operator content in both integer and half-integer spin sectors. Our results resolve the long-standing question of the nature of a topological phase transition in a setting relevant to quantum Hall experiments, while also providing the first realization of a fermionic theory on the fuzzy sphere, previously limited to bosonic theories.</p>

            <h2>Laser-engineered $Γ$-point Topology in Trigonal Bismuthene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhe Li, Haijun Cao, Sheng Meng</p>
            <p>The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases. Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands. Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation, facilitating applications of artificial topological materials.</p>

            <p>We report the experimental realization of a spin-1/2 extended diamond chain in a verdazyl-Cu complex, where competing interactions and lattice distortions give rise to exotic quantum phases. The magnetic properties exhibit a zero-field energy gap and 1/2 magnetization plateau, which is explained by a dimer-monomer model. Considering the effective interactions between the monomers, three types of dimer-dimer phases are expected to appear as the ground state, depending on the magnitude of the lattice distortions. By mapping to the nonlinear sigma model, three phases are distinguished topologically, and a symmetry-protected topological phase equivalent to the Haldane phase is identified. Furthermore, a nontrivial magnetization is observed above the 1/2 plateau region, suggesting a gapped dimer phase accompanied by a spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry. The discovery of this rare quantum state has broad implications for strongly correlated systems, topological matter, and quantum information science, where symmetry and topology play crucial roles.</p>

In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of $d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the Néel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their intrinsic properties.</p>

            <p>The recently reported gate-tunable superconductivity in monolayer WTe$_2$ exhibits several striking anomalies beyond the standard paradigm, including a contrasting carrier-density dependence of the transition temperature $T_c$ in weakly and strongly disordered regimes and more surprisingly, the sudden disappearance of superconducting fluctuations below a critical carrier density. To understand these features, we go beyond the mean-field theory to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density by explicitly incorporating both Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase fluctuations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations are minimal in the weak-disorder regime but become crucial under strong disorder, where the zero-temperature gap renormalized by NG quantum fluctuations becomes density-dependent while the BKT fluctuations drive the superconducting $T_c$ below the gap-closing temperature. Simulations within this unified framework combining with the density-functional-theory input to account for the excitonic instability quantitatively reproduced nearly all key experimental observations in monolayer WTe$_2$, providing a consistent understanding of reported anomalies.</p>

Contrary to conventional expectations, spin transfer into graphene is not a passive process but is actively driven by spin-selective carrier filtering at the interface. Spin-polarized carriers generated in the WSe$_2$ layer induce a preferential migration of opposite-spin carriers from graphene, which results in net spin magnetization in graphene. This process is governed by interlayer band offsets, density-of-state asymmetry, and Pauli blocking. These findings indicate a microscopic mechanism of spin injection in non-magnetic systems and identify a guiding principle for the design of ultrafast opto-spintronic functionalities in van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Understanding interfacial interactions in two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures is essential for advancing optoelectronic and quantum technologies. We investigate metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)-grown WSe$_2$ films (one to five layers) on graphene/SiC, directly compared to exfoliated WSe$_2$ on SiO$_2$, using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy complemented by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman measurements reveal compressive strain and interfacial charge transfer in WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructures, evidenced by blue-shifted phonon modes and the emergence of higher-order interlayer breathing modes absent on SiO$_2$. Concomitant shifts and attenuation of graphene's G and 2D modes with increasing WSe$_2$ thickness indicate progressive p-type doping of graphene, while WSe$_2$ phonon shifts point to n-type doping of the semiconductor, consistent with interfacial electron transfer. PL shows strong quenching for monolayer WSe$_2$ on graphene due to ultrafast charge transfer and F"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET), with partial emission recovery in multilayers relative to SiO$_2$-supported flakes. Exciton behavior differs strongly between substrates: on SiO$_2$, A- and B-exciton energies vary markedly with thickness, whereas on graphene they remain nearly pinned. This stability reflects the combined effects of graphene's strong dielectric screening and charge-transfer-induced free-carrier screening, with strain playing a secondary role. These results establish graphene, unlike SiO$_2$, as an active interfacial partner that stabilizes excitonic states and enables engineering of the optical response of 2D heterostructures.</p>

Our approach employs a novel out-of-plane capacitive detection method to directly probe this charge accumulation, revealing its distinction and correlation with other surface state properties, such as Laughlin charge pumping. We demonstrate that the accumulated charge density is governed by the quantized Hall conductance but is significantly influenced by dissipation effects due to finite longitudinal conductance. By performing frequency and longitudinal conductance dependence measurements, the underlying ideal quantized charge accumulation is extracted, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Importantly, our out-of-plane method of measuring charge accumulation allows the detection of small electric polarization in future studies, establishing a pathway toward the direct observation of the topological magnetoelectric effect, a manifestation of the four-dimensional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian-Hong She, Jing-Xuan Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has spurred intense interest in exploring analogous mechanisms in other transition metal oxides. This raises a pivotal question: can cuprates, as neighbors to nickelates in the periodic table, host similar two-orbital superconductivity? Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of a series of designed Ruddlesden-Popper cuprates. Our calculations reveal that the parent compound La$_3$Cu$_2$O$_7$ is a weakly correlated metal, and hole-doping fails to induce strong correlation. We find that the actual valence of the copper cations becomes strikingly pinned around +2.3, far away from the targeted $d^8$ configuration. This valence pinning is attributed to the inherent charge-transfer nature of cuprates. We propose this mechanism as a general principle explaining the robust single-orbital physics consistently observed in the cuprate family, holding true even in materials like the high-$T_c$ superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ that appear structurally primed for two-orbital activity. Our results therefore conclude that the route towards two-orbital superconductivity is fundamentally obstructed in cuprates, providing a crucial constraint for the future design of high-temperature superconductors.</p>

            <p>The fuzzy sphere regularisation is a powerful tool to study conformal field theories (CFT) in three spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we extend its scope to CFTs with local fermionic operators. We realise the free Majorana fermion CFT on a setup with one flavour of bosons and one flavour of fermions on the lowest Landau level with a $1/2$ angular momentum mismatch. We allow conversion between two bosons and two fermions, and use a relative chemical potential as the tuning parameter. On the phase diagram, we find three gapped phases, viz. a fermionic integer quantum Hall phase, an $f$-wave chiral topological superconductor, and a bosonic Pfaffian phase. They are separated by two continuous transitions described respectively by a free Majorana fermion and a gauged Ising CFT. We numerically confirm their emergent conformal symmetry through the operator spectrum. We also study the two-point correlation function of the Majorana fermion, and the topological Wilson line defect of the gauged Ising CFT. Our work represents a step towards studying interacting fermionic CFTs and regularising quantum field theories on the fuzzy sphere.</p>

Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results show that magic is unable to detect topological phases, indicating that either an additional resource is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.</p>

            <p>Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.</p>

We investigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using density functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a classical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that directional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion, manifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent friction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization fluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is tightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I- dynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all structural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent agreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the ability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body polarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce key structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it neglects dynamic electronic fluctuations. Our findings connect liquid=state ionic dynamics with the "electronic paddle-wheel" mechanism of ionic diffusion in superionic solids and motivate further exploration of polarization fluctuation effects in complex electrolytes and ionic liquids.</p>

            <h2>Disordered Charged Horizons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Arean, Sebastian Grieninger, Pau G. Romeu</p>
            <p>We construct fully backreacted charged black brane solutions with a spatially disordered chemical potential in asymptotically AdS$_3$ and AdS$_4$, providing holographic duals of strongly coupled disordered systems. At intermediate temperatures these geometries display highly inhomogeneous horizons, though their geometric averages reproduce the clean BTZ and Reissner-Nordström solutions. The low temperature behavior, however, differs sharply between dimensions. In AdS$_3$, inhomogeneities decay and the horizon flows to the clean charged BTZ fixed point, rendering disorder irrelevant in the infrared. In AdS$_4$, horizon inhomogeneities persist: while the averaged geometry flows to the clean AdS$_2\times \mathbb{R}^2$ throat, the disordered horizon induces a finite residual resistivity. These results show that disorder can qualitatively alter the IR physics of holographic metals and indicate violations of the Harris criterion in strongly coupled systems.</p>

            <h2>Comparing Machine Learning and Physics-Based Nanoparticle Geometry Determinations Using Far-Field Spectral Properties</h2>

            <p>Anisotropic metal nanostructures exhibit polarization-dependent light scattering. This property has been widely exploited to determine geometries of subwavelength structures using far-field microscopy. Here, we explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) to determine the geometries of gold nanorods (NRs) such as in-plane orientation and aspect ratio under linearly polarized dark-field illumination in an optical microscope. We input polarized dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images into a dual-branch multimodal VAE with a single shared latent space trained on paired spectra-image data, using a learnable linear adapter. We achieve prediction of Au NRs using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra input. We determine geometrical parameters of orientational angle and aspect ratio quantitatively via both dual-VAE and physics-based analysis. We show that orientational angle prediction by dual-VAE performs well with only a small (300 particle) training set, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.4 and a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.95. This performance is only marginally worse than the physics-based cos(2theta) fitting approach between the scattering intensity and the polarizing angle, which achieves MAE of 8.78 and CCC of 0.99. Aspect ratio determination is also similar for the dual-VAE and physics-based fitting comparison (MAE of 0.21 vs. 0.23 and CCC of 0.53 vs. 0.68). By learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, the model can generate NR images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio with spectra-only input in the small-data regime (300 particles), suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems requiring both structure and orientation information.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Symmetry-Constrained Framework for Band Inversions in Photonic Crystals with $C_n$ Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze Tao, Fujun Liu</p>
            <p>The lack of a unified theoretical framework for characterizing band inversions across different crystal symmetries hinders the rapid development of topological photonic band engineering. To address this issue, we have constructed a framework constrained by symmetry $k \cdot p$ that universally models bands near high-symmetry points for symmetric photonic crystals $C_6$, $C_4$, $C_3$, and $C_2$. This framework enables a coefficient-free quantitative diagnosis of band topology. We have demonstrated the power of this framework by systematically engineering band inversions. In $C_6$ crystals, we induce a reopening of the linear gap at $\Gamma$. In $C_4$ systems, mirror symmetry enforces a characteristic quadratic coupling leading to distinct spectral features. Our analysis further reveals that a lone $E$ doublet prevents inversion at the $\Gamma$ point in $C_3$ symmetry, while $C_2$ symmetry facilitates a unique inversion of $Y$ pointsints with anisotropic gap. This symmetry-first, fit-free approach establishes a direct link between experimental band maps and the extraction of fundamental topological parameters. It offers a universal tool for inversion and coupling-order identification.</p>

            <p>We derive the far-field solution for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</p>

            <p>Recently, the altermagnets, a new kind of collinear antiferromagnet with nearly zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin-splitting of bands, have sparked great interest. Despite simple magnetic structures, these altermagnets exhibit intriguing and intricate dependence of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) on the Néel vector, in contrast to the conventional perpendicular configuration of Hall current with magnetization in ferromagnets. However, the fundamental relationship between the AHE and the Néel vector remains largely elusive. Here, we reveal all the unconventional anomalous Hall textures in the Néel vector space, dubbed anomalous-Hall Néel textures (AHNTs) for altermagnets. Specifically, we identify 10 types across four categories of AHNTs for all altermagnets. Notably, we find that AHNTs resemble the known spin textures in momentum space, and further reveal their symmetry origin. Meanwhile, we examine our key discoveries in prototypical altermagnets. Our work offers a thorough understanding of AHE in altermagnets and a complete and pictorial classification of altermagnets based on the geometry of response functions.</p>

            <p>We provide a theoretical demonstration of controllable non-relativistic spin splitting in both electronic and magnonic bands via targeted structural distortions tied to specific phonon modes. Using MnF$_2$ as a model system, we identify a $d$-wave magnon band splitting between magnon modes of specific handedness, directly correlated with the non-relativistic spin splitting observed in the electronic structure. Crucially, we show that structural distortions associated with the A$_{2u}$ and A$_{1g}$ phonon modes (8.52 and 9.74 THz) modulate these splittings without altering the antiferromagnetic order. The effect originates from changes in the nonmagnetic ligand environment, highlighting the key role of lattice degrees of freedom in governing spin dynamics. Our findings establish a novel route for structure-mediated control of spin splitting, opening possibilities for tunable magnonic and spintronic functionalities in antiferromagnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Yang Li, Zheyan Wan, Juven Wang, Shing-Tung Yau, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Yang Li, Juven Wang, Yi-Zhuang You</p>
            <p>Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from Kähler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</p>

            <p>The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated ground-state. From the spatial correlations of local density of states (LDOS) maps measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge between extended and localized states at the valence band-edge. Using theoretical analysis to explain the energy-dependent LDOS fluctuations, we estimate the system's conductivity change across this effective metal-insulator transition. Then, we compute the multifractal spectra of iso-energy LDOS maps and show that they follow an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) - the field theory of mesoscopic electronic systems. This observation suggests that NL$\sigma$Ms are valid even in a strongly correlated 2D system, down to conductivity levels as low as g ~ 0.1. We anticipate that the relation may be different in the chiral-superconducting phase reported for p-doped Sn/Si monolayer. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis could equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments.</p>

The decay rate is determined by quantum fluctuations and scattering processes involving the decay of a single magnon into three. These processes are kinematically allowed due to the convexity of the altermagnetic magnon dispersion. For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for a given momentum only magnons with one specific chirality can spontaneously decay.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Muhammad Sedik</p>
            <p>We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.</p>

            <p>The one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with non-reciprocal hoppings is a prominent example of a relatively simple non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical system, which allows to study various phenomena in open quantum systems without adding extra gain and loss terms. Here we propose to use it as a building block to construct a correlated non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in two dimensions. It has the characteristic form of a flux model with clock-anticlockwise non-reciprocal hopping on each plaquette. Adding the on-site Hubbard type interaction we analyze the formation of the longe-range antiferromagnetic order and its spin excitations. Such a model is non-Hermitian, but $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, which leads to the existence of two regions: a region of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry (real-valued spectrum) and a region of broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry with exceptional lines and complex-valued energy spectrum. The transition from one region to another is controlled by the value of the on-site interaction parameter and coincides with the metal-insulator transition. We also analyze the spin wave spectrum, which is characterized by two diffusive d-wave type of modes corresponding to gain and loss.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Baptiste de Vaulx, Quintin N. Meier, Pierre Toulemonde, Andrés Cano, Valerio Olevano</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at a critical temperature above 80~K points to a non-conventional pairing mechanism in nickelates as in cuprates, possibly due to electronic correlations. We have calculated from first principles the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under the effect of pressure and epitaxial strain including correlations by the $GW$ approximation to the many-body self-energy. We find that the Fermi surface is composed of a characteristic cuprate-shape sheet $\beta$ plus a nickelate-specific cylinder $\alpha$, both from Ni $e_g$ orbitals, with a non-negligible drop in the quasiparticle weight and an effective 1D character. This topology results from a delicate balance between the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ hole pocket $\gamma$, which is suppressed by correlations, and an emerging La-5$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electron pocket induced by both correlation and pressure/strain effects and whose role at low energy has been neglected so far. Unlike cuprates, the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is already correctly described from ab initio and in agreement with the experiment without the need to introduce Hubbard $U$ adjustable parameters or to invoke a strongly correlated physics.</p>

The 3$\omega$ technique is an established methodology for studying the thermal conductivity of thin films, becoming particularly suitable in the case of bulk specimens for $T\gtrsim$300K, where standard stationary techniques require significant corrections for radiative losses. Although this method has been employed in several works, it remains not widely adopted because its implementation demands considerable sophistication, including experiment design, thin film deposition techniques, and choices of the geometry of the current/heat transducer, electronics, and analytical treatment of the signals. Based on a critical review of the technique's key technical aspects, this work provides practical support for a rapid and user-friendly implementation, from the design phase through to execution and analysis. We release a Python-based graphical user interface that supports a quantitative estimation of the investigated temperature profiles based on the geometrical parameters (width/length) of the deposited transducer (heater/thermometer metal line) before an experiment, guaranteeing an optimal design of the experimental conditions for each given material under scrutiny.</p>

            <p>Topological phases have been extensively studied over the past two decades, primarily in quantum pure states, where they are protected by exact symmetries. Recently, numerous studies have theoretically demonstrated the existence of average symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed quantum states, which naturally arise in real systems due to decoherence or disorder. Despite extensive experimental observations of exact SPT phases in various systems, ranging from solid-state materials to synthetic matters, average SPT phases are yet to be observed until this work. Here we report direct observations of disorder-induced many-body interacting average SPT phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, resulting in fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The induced topological phase is vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to the regular lattice without disorder. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices.</p>

            <p>We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.</p>

            <h2>Hydrogen defects and band alignment in metal-organic frameworks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khang Hoang</p>
            <p>Band alignment, namely the prediction of band-edge positions of semiconductors and insulators in aqueous solutions, is an important problem in physics and chemistry. Such a prediction is especially challenging for complex materials. Here we present an approach to align band structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an absolute energy scale which can be used for direct comparison with experiments. Hydrogen defects are used as probes into the chemical bonding of the covalently bonded hybrid materials. An effective defect energy level, defined as the average of the charge-state transition levels of the defects at the linker and at the secondary building unit, is identified as a charge neutrality level to align band structures. This level captures subtle chemical details at both the organic and inorganic building blocks and provides results that are in agreement with experiments in a wide range of different MOFs. We also compare with results obtained from using other approaches involving surface calculations and average pore-center electrostatic potentials.</p>

            <h2>Decoding the Stability of Transition-Metal Alloys with Theory-infused Deep Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Huang, Shih-Han Wang, Shuyi Cao, Luke E. K. Achenie, Hongliang Xin</p>
            <p>We introduce an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts the cohesive energy of transition-metal alloys (TMAs) by embedding cohesion theory within graph neural networks (GNNs). Beyond accurate prediction of cohesive energy, a key indicator of thermodynamic stability, the model offers mechanistic insights by disentangling energy contributions into physically meaningful components. These data-driven interpretations reveal periodic trends and stability principles governing transition metals. We apply the model to single-atom alloys (SAAs) to assess their thermodynamic resilience against two destabilizing processes: agglomeration (adatom clustering) and segregation (migration into the subsurface). Our analysis shows that these phenomena are governed by distinct physical factors-agglomeration is primarily influenced by localized d-orbital coupling, while segregation is dictated by delocalized effects such as wavefunction renormalization. This model thus serves as an explainable AI tool for understanding and guiding the design of stable TMAs, with implications for catalysis and materials discovery.</p>

            <p>In cavity magnonics, magnon-photon hybridization has been widely investigated for both fundamental studies and applications. Planar superconducting resonators operating at microwave frequencies have demonstrated the possibility to achieve high couplings with magnons by exploiting the confinement of the microwave field in a reduced volume. Here we report a study of the coupling of high-$T_c$ YBCO superconducting waveguides with 104-nm-thick YIG magnetic films. We study the evolution of mode frequencies as a function of temperature and extract the coupling strength of hybrid magnon-photon modes. We show that the experimental results can be reproduced using a simple model in which the temperature dependence of the penetration depth accounts for the evolution of the polaritonic spectrum.</p>

            <h2>Magnetotransport in two-dimensional interacting massless-massive fermion mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuping Huang, D. S. Eliseev, V. M. Kovalev, O. V. Kibis, Yu. Yu. Illarionov, I. G. Savenko</p>
            <p>The presence of two types of holes, namely the Dirac holes and the massive holes, in a two-dimensional sample exposed to an external permanent magnetic field leads to the emergence of the temperature and magnetic field--dependent contribution to the resistivity due to their interactions. Taking a HgTe-based two-dimensional semimetal as a testbed, we develop a theoretical model describing the role of interactions between the degenerate massive and massless Dirac particles for the magnetoconductivity and resistivity in the presence of a classical magnetic field. If only the Dirac holes are present in the system, the magnetoconductivity acquires a finite interaction-induced contribution which would be vanishing for the parabolic spectrum. It demonstrates $T^4\ln(1/T)$ behavior at low temperatures for short-range interhole interaction potential, and $T^2$-like behavior in case of long-range interhole interaction potential. However, the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect are not affected by the Dirac holes interparticle correlations. In contrast to this, the presence of two types of holes provides a finite contribution to the magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the classical Hall effect resistivity. The temperature behavior of the magnetoconductivity here is $\sim T^2$ in the case of the short-range constant interparticle interaciton potential and $T^2\ln(1/T)$ for the bare unscreened Coulomb interaction. A classically strong magnetic field suppresses the interaction-induced corrections to magnetoresistivity of massless-massive hole gas mixture.</p>

            <h2>How transparent is graphene? A surface science perspective on remote epitaxy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zach LaDuca, Anshu Sirohi, Quinn Campbell, Jason K Kawasaki</p>
            <p>Remote epitaxy is the synthesis of a single crystalline film on a graphene-covered substrate, where the film adopts epitaxial registry to the substrate as if the graphene is transparent. Despite many exciting applications for flexible electronics, strain engineering, and heterogeneous integration, an understanding of the fundamental synthesis mechanisms remains elusive. Here we offer a perspective on the synthesis mechanisms, focusing on the foundational assumption of graphene transparency. We identify challenges for quantifying the strength of the remote substrate potential that permeates through graphene, and propose Fourier and beating analysis as a bias-free method for decomposing the lattice potential contributions from the substrate, from graphene, and from surface reconstructions, each at different frequencies. We highlight the importance of graphene-induced reconstructions on epitaxial templating, drawing comparison to moiré epitaxy. We highlight the role of the remote potential in tuning surface diffusion and adatom kinetics on graphene, which are crucial for navigating the competition between remote epitaxy and defect-seeded mechanisms like pinhole epitaxy. In light of this weak remote potential, we re-evaluate the current state-of-the-art experimental evidence, highlighting why it remains challenging to experimentally validate a ``remote'' epitaxy mechanism that cannot be explained by alternatives, such as pinhole-seeded epitaxy or serial van der Waals epitaxy. We end with one experimental example that, to out knowledge, cannot be explained by competing mechanisms: a different long-range epitaxial relationship for GdPtSb films grown on graphene/sapphire, compared to direct epitaxy on sapphire. We suggest for future experiments that directly measure the remote potential and impact of tunable growth kinetics.</p>

            <p>Memory effects during metal-insulator transitions in quantum materials reveal complex physics and potential for novel electronics mimicking biological neural systems. Nonetheless, understanding of memory and nonlinearity in sequential non-equilibrium transitions remains elusive as the full chain of transitions can involve features lasting anywhere from femtoseconds to microseconds. Here, we extend time-resolved x-ray Bragg diffraction to the dynamic range of timescales spanning 9 orders of magnitude to fully trace the pathways of photoexcited insulator-metal transition and the following relaxation through non-equilibrium metal-insulator transitions in epitaxial films of V2O3, a promising Mott material. We find 5 orders of magnitude variation in metal-insulator transition time, from nanoseconds to hundreds of microseconds, depending on pre-excitation phase state. We provide a theoretical explanation and simulations based on strain feedback to domain nucleation. The lingering transition is stretched in time by memory of spatial and energy heterogeneity and, contrary to known memory effects in vanadium oxides commonly described by power laws, follows an extremely (factor below 0.2) stretched exponential. The induced dramatic slowdown in the light-driven highly correlated system signifies unusually high heterogeneity of transition barriers similar to biological systems, and demonstrates importance of non-local correlations of structure in evolution of transitional phases in quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of $R$-parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.</p>

            <h2>The Thermodynamic Limit of Extreme First-Passage Times</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Talia Baravi, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of $N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel distribution, but a Fréchet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$ diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the Fréchet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits, respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities. We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.</p>

            <h2>Fast phase prediction of charged polymer blends by white-box machine learning surrogates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Clayton Ellis, Xinyi Fang, Christopher Balzer, Timothy Quah, M. Scott Shell, Glenn H. Fredrickson, Mengyang Gu</p>
            <p>Compatibilized polymer blends are a complex, yet versatile and widespread category of material. When the components of a binary blend are immiscible, they are typically driven towards a macrophase-separated state, but with the introduction of electrostatic interactions, they can be either homogenized or shifted to microphase separation. However, both experimental and simulation approaches face significant challenges in efficiently exploring the vast design space of charge-compatibilized polymer blends, encompassing chemical interactions, architectural properties, and composition. In this work, we introduce a white-box machine learning approach integrated with polymer field theory to predict the phase behavior of these systems, which is significantly more accurate than conventional black-box machine learning approaches. The random phase approximation (RPA) calculation is used as a testbed to determine polymer phases. Instead of directly predicting the polymer phase output of RPA calculations from a large input space by a machine learning model, we build a parallel partial Gaussian process model to predict the most computationally intensive component of the RPA calculation that only involves polymer architecture parameters as inputs. This approach substantially reduces the computational cost of the RPA calculation across a vast input space with nearly 100% accuracy for out-of-sample prediction, enabling rapid screening of polymer blend charge-compatibilization designs. More broadly, the white-box machine learning strategy offers a promising approach for dramatic acceleration of polymer field-theoretic methods for mapping out polymer phase behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Cucciari, Lilia Boeri</p>
            <p>We present the first fully $ab\;initio$ microscopic description of cubic and tetragonal Nb$_3$Sn. We compute the anharmonic free energy surface, phonon spectra, and solve the full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap of the two phases. Our results show that anharmonic effects are crucial to stabilize both the cubic and tetragonal structures, yielding phonon spectra in excellent agreement with neutron scattering data. We find that the martensitic transition is weakly first-order and that the superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic yet fully-open, with contributions from both longitudinal and transverse Nb $d$-orbitals, revealing an unexpected three-dimensional pairing mechanism. We also find that the experimentally observed reduction of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ across the transition is explained by a combination of overall weaker electron-phonon coupling and a redistribution of Fermi velocities, which shifts parts of the Fermi surface to longer coherence lengths and limits $H_{c2}$. Based on these insights, we propose that Sn-site doping could enhance transverse-state coupling and gap isotropy, potentially improving both $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, while Nb-site doping reinforce $H_{c2}$ at the cost of lowering $T_c$.</p>

            <p>In superconductivity, the Cooper pair \cite{Ref1} is a bound state of a pair of weakly interacting electrons in a metal which forces us to insert a factor of $2e$ (instead of $e$) in the phase of the wave function in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. We claim that the existence of such a factor is universal. In \cite{Ref2}, we proposed an explanation for the AB effect (or equivalently, a supersymmetric Dirac monopole) based on SUSY. It is shown that this model opens a path to recapture this factor without the need for arguments related to attractive pairs. The idea is also applied to the case of a nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) when it is coupled to $\mathcal{N}=1$, supergravity.</p>

Our arguments work for the entire region of exponents of regular power-law interactions, namely $\alpha > d$, and for any $q \geq 2$.

            <p>We construct and study inhomogeneous non-Hermitian strongly coupled holographic field theories. We consider two models: a lattice where in each site there is some inflow/outflow of matter and a Hermitian/non-Hermitian/Hermitian junction. By tuning a complex external gauge field, we find a non-Hermitian model which can be mapped to a Hermitian one via a complexified U(1) gauge transformation. On the other hand, in the absence of the gauge field we find non-Hermitian solutions with a purely imaginary current. Despite this, all expectation values respect PT symmetry and thus we expect the system to feature unitary time evolution. Nonetheless, we have not found a map bringing these solutions to a Hermitian description. We study the RG flows of solutions with imaginary current finding that in the IR they can be mapped to a Hermitian conformal fixed point via a complexified U(1) transformation. Remarkably, we also obtain solutions where the null energy condition is violated near the boundary of the dual geometry.</p>

I then show that any local measurement, including the effects of the environment, will collapse the symmetric state onto the broken state in the large volume limit. In any discussion involving observers, de Sitter spacetimes are, therefore, best described globally by the broken phase, while local observers, in the small volume limit, can not discriminate between different degenerate global vacuum states and are therefore best described by the symmetric state. As a consequence, a small Hubble-sized local region initially in the symmetric state will, after a time scale corresponding to the Page time of de Sitter space, have expanded to a large region in the broken state. This illuminates the physical nature of soft graviton modes in de Sitter spacetimes.</p>

            <p>We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA approach outperforms the cumulant expansion method in certain models and performs comparably well in others, all while offering significantly lower computational costs and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</p>

            <p>Developing methods to accurately characterize and mitigate the impact of noise is crucial for enhancing the fidelity of quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a circuit structure-preserving error mitigation framework for parameterized quantum circuits. A key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to retain the original circuit architecture while effectively characterizing and mitigating gate errors, enabling robust and high-fidelity simulations. This makes it particularly well suited for small-scale circuits that require repeated execution at large sampling rates. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform variational quantum simulations of a non-Hermitian ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising chain on IBM Quantum processors. The mitigated result shows excellent agreement with exact theoretical predictions across a range of noise levels. Our strategy offers a practical solution for addressing gate-induced errors and significantly broadens the scope of feasible quantum simulations on current quantum hardware.</p>

            <p>We study the long-time dynamics of a dissipative Ising chain with varying quantum correlation. Invoking an ensemble-average formalism, and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide a qualitatively correct description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.</p>

            <p>We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</p>

            <p>We study the $O(N)$ vector model for scalars with quartic interaction at large $N$ on $S^1\times S^2$ without the singlet constraint. The non-trivial fixed point of the model is described by a thermal mass satisfying the gap equation at large $N$. We obtain the free energy and the energy density for the model as a series at low temperature in units of the radius of the sphere. We show these results agree with the Borel-Padé extrapolations of the high temperature expansions of the free energy and energy density obtained in our previous work. This agreement validates both the expansions and demonstrates that low temperature expansions obtained here correspond to the same fixed point studied earlier at high temperature. We obtain the ratio of the free energy of the theory at the non-trivial fixed point to that of the Gaussian theory at all values of temperature. This ratio begins at $4/5$ when the temperature is infinity, decreases to a minimum value of $0.760937$, then increases and approaches unity as the temperature is decreased.</p>

            <p>We investigate the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR)-a fundamental trade-off between dynamical activity and current fluctuations-in two configurations of a maser heat engine. We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics. While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of one and two qubit superconducting quantum gates under the non-Markovian $1/f$ noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinjia Chen, Shuocang Zhang, Qiang Shi</p>
            <p>Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects, Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$ noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.</p>

            <h2>Record High Polarization at 2V and Imprint-free operation in Superlattice HfO2-ZrO2 by Proper Tuning of Ferro and Antiferroelectricity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinye Li, Sayani Majumdar</p>
            <p>Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological intelligence, offers a pathway to revolutionize artificial intelligence (AI) by unifying memory and processing in an energy-efficient, sustainable framework for data-intensive tasks. Ferroelectric (FE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for implementing artificial synapses, yet achieving low-voltage operation in CMOS back-end compatible devices remains a major challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that proper tuning of ferro and antiferroelectric phases in HfO2-ZrO2(HZO) superlattice based capacitors can lead to imprint-free switching with record switchable polarization (2Pr) of 76 micro Coulomb cm-2 under an external field of only 2 MV cm-1. The sizable remanent polarization of the superlattice HZO further enables linear potentiation and depression with an on to off ratio of 20 within a 3 MV cm-1 bias window. Under pulsed operation, the devices show robust endurance, either maintaining polarization with less than 10 per cent degradation up to 10^8 cycles or surviving beyond 10^9 cycles with recoverable fatigue. By elucidating two distinct fatigue mechanisms, this work highlights strategies for optimizing FE devices to meet the stringent demands of neuromorphic training applications.</p>

            <h2>Transient localization from fractionalization: vanishingly small heat conductivity in gapless quantum magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Feng, Penghao Zhu, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.</p>

            <p>Geometric frustration lies at the heart of many unconventional quantum phases in strongly interacting electron systems. Here, we analytically determine the ground state magnetization of the half-filled Hubbard model on frustrated geometries where superstable states -- eigenstates which are robust against frustration -- are manifest. Our results apply to a broad class of lattices, including those where altermagnetic and superconducting states are known to emerge. Furthermore, they provide evidence for phase transitions involving a geometric rearrangement of magnetic correlations in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism revealed by polarized neutrons in MnF$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quentin Faure, Dalila Bounoua, Victor Balédent, Arsen Gukasov, V. Ovidiu Garlea, Afonso Ribeiro, Jeffrey G. Rau, Sylvain Petit, Paul McClarty</p>
            <p>Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets, have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.</p>

            <h2>Quantum control of exciton motion in electric field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingjia Li, Jorge Casanova, Xi Chen, E. Ya. Sherman</p>
            <p>We study quantum control of classical motion of a two-dimensional exciton by optimizing the time-dependent electric field of a stripe-like gate acting on the exciton and inducing its time-dependent quantum dipole moment. We propose a search method that significantly reduces computational requirements while efficiently identifying optimal control parameters. By leveraging this method, one can precisely manipulate the exciton's final position and velocity over a specified evolution time. These results can be applied for control of exciton fluxes and population, and for spatially resolved light emission in two-dimensional semiconducting structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Meirinhos, Michael Turaev, Michael Kajan, Tim Bode, Johann Kroha</p>
            <p>We provide a theoretical framework to describe the nonequilibrium temporal dynamics of correlated electron systems for realistic system parameters and the consequent, often exponentially long time scales. It is based on an entirely integro-differential formulation of time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory, the noncrossing approximation, and the quantum representation of a driving electromagnetic field. For heavy-fermion systems, we identify two key nonequilibrium mechanisms governing their time evolution after a single-cycle terahertz excitation: transient, instantaneous shift from the Kondo toward the mixed-valence regime by an enhanced, photoassisted hybridization, and slow recovery of the heavy-fermion state due to the long Kondo coherence time. This explains recent time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy experiments microscopically and establishes the latter as a technique for direct experimental access to the Kondo coherence time and to the heavy-fermion quasiparticle weight, central for the classification of heavy-fermion quantum phase transitions.</p>

The sample temperature is variable and both magnetometry and susceptibility measurements are simultaneously possible with the sample temperature above 40 K. Through the use of a cryogenic chip socket and silicon interposer round trip RF losses to a sample are approximately 15 dB at 20 GHz.

            <h2>Exploring the nature of the emergent gauge field in composite-fermion metals: A large-scale microscopic study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amogh Anakru, Mytraya Gattu, Ajit C. Balram, Xiao-Chuan Wu, Prashant Kumar, Zhen Bi, J. K. Jain</p>
            <p>Field theories of the composite-fermion (CF) metal model it as a Fermi sea of composite fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field. Within a random phase approximation, these theories predict that the Landau damping of the gauge field resulting from its coupling to the low-energy, long-wavelength CF particle-hole excitations modifies the electrons' density-density correlation function related to the static structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q$. This produces a non-analytic correction $\propto q^{3}\ln q$ to $S(q)$ (with the magnetic length $\ell_{B}=1$). Thanks to the recently developed quaternion formulation for Jain-Kamilla projection of CF wave functions, the evaluation of $S(q)$ from the accurate microscopic theory of composite fermions has now become possible for systems containing as many as $N=900$ CFs, which enables a reliable determination of the small-$q$ behavior of $S(q)$. We study CF metals corresponding to electrons at Landau level filling factors $\nu=1/2$ and $1/4$, and for completeness, also of bosons at $\nu=1$ and $1/3$. In the $q\rightarrow0$ limit, our microscopic calculation reveals a $q^{3}$ term in $S(q)$ of the CF metals rather than $q^{3} \ln q$. This behavior is well-predicted by a model of a non-interacting Fermi sea of dipolar CFs, which also obtains its coefficient accurately.</p>

            <p>We present a computational investigation, in conjunction with synthesis and experimental characterization, into the structural, electronic, and optical properties of layered 2D organic lead bromide perovskites. We contrast materials based on the chiral (R/S)-4-fluoro-$\alpha$-methylbenzylammonium (R/S-FMBA), which have been shown to lead to bright room-temperature circularly polarized luminescence, with the similar achiral 4-fluorobenzylammonium (FBA). Using density functional theory (DFT) with van der Waals (vdW) corrections, we study relaxed structures (compared with X-ray diffraction, XRD) and optical absorption spectra (compared with experiments), as well as bandstructure and orbital character of transitions. We develop and provide a Python code to calculate octahedral distortions and compare DFT and XRD results, finding that vdW corrections are important for accuracy and that DFT overestimates octahedral tilt angles. (FMBA)$_2$PbBr$_4$ shows among the largest tilt angle differences (often termed $\Delta \beta$) reported, $14^\circ$, indicating strong inversion symmetry-breaking which enables its chiral emission. The lowest-energy optical transitions involve the perovskite only and are polarized within the layer.

            <p>Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.</p>

            <p>Chirality in magnetic systems gives rise to a wide range of exotic phenomena, yet its influence in $S=1$ chains remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental study of a chiral antiferromagnetic (AFM) $S=1$ chain, [Ni(pym)(H$_{2}$O)$_{4}$]SO$_{4} \cdot$ H$_{2}$O (pym = pyrimidine), where the Ni(II) octahedral orientation exhibits a four-fold chiral periodicity. Muon spin rotation measurements indicate the onset of long-range magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 1.82(2)\,\mathrm{K}$. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a chiral AFM order driven by a chiral modulation of the easy-axis anisotropy direction, rather than the typical scenario of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, geometrical frustration or higher-order interactions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements reveal dispersive spin-wave excitations well described by linear spin-wave theory, with Hamiltonian parameters $J_{0} = 6.81(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (intrachain exchange), $J'_{1\rm a} = -0.091(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (interchain exchange), and $D = -3.02(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (easy-axis single-ion anisotropy). These parameters are further validated by Monte Carlo simulations of the magnetisation. Additionally, the INS data reveal multiple dispersionless bands, suggesting the presence of further excitations beyond the scope of our linear spin-wave theory.</p>

            <p>Under a sufficiently high applied electric field, a non-polar antiferroelectric material, such as \ce{PbZrO3}, can undergo a rapid transformation to a polar ferroelectric phase. While this behavior is promising for energy storage and electromechanical applications, a complete understanding of the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the phase transition remain elusive. Here, we employ \textit{operando} scanning transmission electron microscopy electric field biasing to directly resolve the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in \ce{PbZrO3} thin films under device-relevant conditions. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals a multi-step transition that includes several metastable phases. Complementary nano-beam electron diffraction and atomic scale analysis further show that this pathway and its end states can be modulated, leading to the formation of a \quotes{dead layer} near the substrate with suppressed switching behavior. Taking advantage of this depth-dependent heterogeneity, dynamic phase transformations are observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases. At this dynamic transition front, repeated phase interconversion is shown to be driven by competing internal (due to substrate clamping and extended defects) and external fields, allowing the relative energies of intermediate phases to be compared as a function of electric field. This work highlights the critical role of local energetics in phase stability and provides key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions, guiding the design of antiferroelectric-based devices.</p>

Here, we develop a quantum theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full theory including interaction and topological effects for the magnetic response of excitons.</p>

            <p>Twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides - specifically twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ - have recently emerged as a versatile platform for strongly correlated and topological phases of matter. These two-dimensional systems host tunable flat Chern bands in which Coulomb interactions can dominate over kinetic energy, giving rise to a variety of interaction-driven phenomena. A series of groundbreaking experiments have revealed a rich landscape of quantum phases, including integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, quantum spin Hall states, anomalous Hall metals, zero-field composite Fermi liquids, and unconventional superconductors, along with more conventional topologically trivial correlated states including antiferromagnets. This review surveys recent experimental discoveries and theoretical progress in understanding these phases, with a focus on the key underlying mechanisms - band topology, electron interactions, symmetry breaking, and charge fractionalization. We emphasize the unique physics of twisted TMD homobilayers in comparison to other related systems, discuss open questions, and outline promising directions for future research.</p>

            <p>Our high-throughput computational screening of the Materials Project database has identified 140 candidate materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic behavior in the $Pnma$ space group. Through systematic density functional theory calculations comparing various magnetic configurations, we demonstrate that 91 of these compounds preferentially stabilize in altermagnetic ground states, with 20 adopting the perovskite structure. Using NaCoF$_3$ as a prototypical example, we perform a comprehensive investigation of its electronic structure, magnetic ordering, and orbital configurations. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions occupy the 4c Wyckoff position and support three distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, among which the $G$-AFM configuration emerges as the ground state. Detailed symmetry analysis uncovers that the inter-sublattice coupling in the $G$-AFM phase is mediated by the combined time-reversal and rotation operation $\hat{T}\{R_{2x}|\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0\}$. This unique symmetry protection gives rise to several remarkable physical phenomena: (i) anisotropic optical conductivity, (ii) prominent anomalous transport effects including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Nernst effect (ANE), and thermal Hall effect (ATHE), and (iii) strong magneto-optical responses manifested through both Kerr and Faraday effects.</p>

            <p>We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</p>

            <p>We study a two-level dissipative non-equilibrium bosonic Rydberg system in an optical lattice, where multiple atoms can occupy a single site. The system is treated using two different approaches: solution of the master equation using a mean-field approximation, and direct numerical simulation of an equivalent quantum model. It is found that, depending on the on-site interaction strength, the system can either be uniform or have an antiferromagnet-like density-wave structure in terms of the Rydberg excitation distribution. Our mean-field treatment detects an interesting oscillatory phase as well, but the numerical simulation in 1D does not capture it. The origin of all these phases are investigated by studying the spatial correlations, and by calculating the fixed points of the dynamics. It is observed that an initial population difference across the sublattices helps to enhance the density-wave order. The scaling behavior of the system is also analyzed and a signature of weak universality is obtained.</p>

            <p>The transition to an absorbing phase in a spatiotemporal system is a well-investigated nonequilibrium dynamic transition. The absorbing phase transitions fall into a few universality classes, defined by the critical exponents observed at the critical point. We present a coupled map lattice (CML) model with quenched disorder in the couplings. In this model, spatial disorders are introduced in the form of asymmetric coupling with a larger coupling ($p$) to a neighbor on the right and a smaller coupling ($1-p$) to the neighbor on the left, for $0 \le p \le0.5$. For $p=0$, the system belongs to the directed percolation universality class. For $p>0$, we observe continuously changing critical exponents at the critical point. The order parameter is the fraction of turbulent sites $m(t)$. %sites that are not in the laminar region. We observe a power-law decay, $m(t) \sim t^{-\delta}$, at the critical point $\epsilon_c$, where $\epsilon$ is the diffusive coupling parameter. These exponents change continuously and do not match any known universality class in any limit. This could be related to changes in the eigenvalue spectrum of the connectivity matrix as the disorder is introduced.</p>

            <p>We analyze the noise in a multi-terminal multi-channel conductor under arbitrary time-dependent driving and subject to -- possibly large -- static potential and temperature biases. We show that the full out-of-equilibrium zero-frequency noise is constrained by a fluctuation-dissipation bound. It consists of an upper bound expressed in terms of weighted current components of the separate Floquet bands arising from the time-dependent driving. In the limit of large static temperature bias, it has an intuitive interpretation in terms of the dissipated powers due to the static potential bias and due to the time-dependent driving. Furthermore, we show the existence of a second bound that relies on the specific shape of the electron distribution resulting from the driving, which is often even tighter than the fluctuation-dissipation bound. We show the implications of our bounds at the simple, but experimentally relevant example of a two-terminal conductor in the presence of an ac bias.</p>

In this work, we study the Eu-based intermetallic noncentrosymmetric system Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ which has 65 atoms per unit cell and 4 distinct crystallographic positions for europium and 17 positions for mercury. Our detailed analysis of magnetism of large single crystals suggests that europium in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ might be present in two valence states, resulting in a fragile magnetic ground state. Due to the cage-like structure with a large distance between the Eu atoms, those atoms are weakly ferromagnetically coupled and Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ orders at low temperatures, below $T_{1} = 5.5$ K, with a subsequent spin re-orientation at $T_{2} = 4.3$ K. There is no sign of magnetic frustration. Interestingly, the magnetic ordering of europium sub-lattices results in a magnetization pole reversal with a weak ferrimagnetic ground state. Additional magnetic phases can be induced by application of a modest external magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Controlling the Glass Transition through Active Fluctuating Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emir Sezik, Henry Alston, Thibault Bertrand</p>
            <p>Fluctuating pairwise interactions are understood to drive fluid-like states in dense biological systems. These states find a broad range of functionalities, such as directing growth during morphogenesis and forming aggregates with heightened mechanical response. However, a tractable model capturing the role of microscopic fluctuating interactions in these structural transitions is crucially lacking. Here, we study a $p$-spin model with fluctuating pairwise couplings (of strength $D_a$ and persistence time $t_a$) as a schematic model for interaction-mediated fluidization. We find that while stronger fluctuations suppress the glass transition, more persistent fluctuations have the opposite effect. We identify the presence of an emergent fluctuation-dissipation relation at long times. We numerically extract the critical temperature $T_c(D_a, t_a)$ from a scaling relation near the transition, illustrating how microscopic fluctuations control the glass transition.</p>

            <h2>Investigation on Structural, Optical, Thermal, and Magnetic Properties of Bismuth Ferrite Nanoparticles Synthesized at Lower Annealing Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naresh Prajapati, G. Surya Prakash, Manoj Kumar, Himanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>Due to its multiferroic properties and narrow optical bandgap, Bismuth ferrite has been widely explored for spintronics, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis applications. Bismuth ferrite can be synthesized in various forms like bulk, thin films, and nanostructures using various synthesis techniques. It is challenging to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase due to the volatile nature of bismuth and the very narrow temperature range for forming this phase. So, this work aims to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase at lower annealing temperatures using an efficient sol-gel method. We have chosen the annealing temperature from 450 to 650 C, and a detailed analysis of structural and optical properties is performed here. X-ray diffraction is used to confirm the crystalline nature of the material. Single-phase Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns is carried out to study the effect of annealing temperature on structural parameters. All the samples are crystalized in pure rhombohedral BiFeO3 phase with the R3c space group symmetry, except those annealed at higher temperatures, 600 C and 650 C. Strain and dislocation densities were decreasing with an increase in the annealing temperature. From the UV-visible analysis, a strong response is observed below 600 nm in the visible region, and the band gap from the absorption behaviour is estimated in the range of 2.26 - 2.60 eV for these Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the existence of metal-oxygen bonds in Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were found to be thermally stable from the thermal analysis performed using differential scanning calorimetry. Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles were weakly magnetic from the vibrating sample magnetometry analysis.</p>

Nonreciprocity and chirality enter the chemical potential at vanishing order in spatial gradients, taking the form of local and non-local contributions. Chirality manifests as the curl of the nonreciprocal current, while the latter is simultaneously strongly modified by former. Their interplay generates distinctive dynamical states, including phase separation with edge currents and a spatiotemporally disordered phase with both chiral and nonreciprocal signatures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Shukla, Sadhana Matth, Raghavendra Pal, S.S.A. Warsi, Himanshu Pandey</p>
            <p>The quest for thermoelectric materials with high figures of merit is an ongoing and significant area of research. In this study, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of the CoTiSi half-Heusler alloy using density functional theory calculations implemented via the Wien2k package. Our approach begins with a thorough structural optimization to determine the equilibrium lattice parameter and the atomic positions of the constituent elements within the unit cell of CoTiSi. Following this, we analyze the thermal transport properties of the alloy under the constant relaxation time approximation, which allows us to gain insights into its thermoelectric performance. Our calculations reveal a substantial Seebeck voltage and thermopower, with notably higher values for P-type doping than N-type doping. This finding highlights the enhanced thermoelectric performance of P-type carriers in this material, providing a starting point for experimentalists to utilize this alloy for real device applications.</p>

            <p>The La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) perovskite has received a lot of attention due to its near room temperature magnetodielectric effect. Despite the recent efforts, the mechanism ruling the correlation between its magnetic and dielectric properties is not yet fully understood. In order to address this issue, we conducted a detailed investigation of the coupling between the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of a polycrystalline LCMO sample. Using magnetic field-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and measurements with a capacitive dilatometer, we show that applying an external magnetic field decreases the unit cell volume, thereby modifying the octahedral distortions. Experiments involving temperature and field-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Co-L2,3 edges provide further evidence that the spin-orbit interaction of outermost Co 3d-orbital and the field-induced enhancement of covalence effects are the key contributors to the magnetostrictive effects. From a detailed analysis using multiplet and density functional theory calculations, we propose that the field-induced modulations of the orbital hybridization and the ligand-to-metal charge transfer are responsible for the changes in the dielectric response of LCMO, thus enabling a direct coupling between magnetic, elastic and dielectric properties in this material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernat Durà Faulí, Lennard Kwakernaak, Martin van Hecke</p>
            <p>Elastic instabilities such as buckling and snapping have evolved into a powerful design principle, enabling memory, sequential shape morphing, and computing in metamaterials and devices. Modifying the post-buckling configurations or their snapping transitions would greatly expand design possibilities, yet general principles for controlling elastic instabilities are lacking. Here, we show that adding a partial cut, or slit, to a flexible beam enables precise control of post-buckling behavior: under compression, slit-beams first buckle, then snap, leading to trista-bility within the hysteretic regime. A truss model explains these phenomena by uncovering the interplay of geometric and slit induced nonlinearities. Leveraging these insights, we realize multi-slit beams with programmable behavior, unlocking a vast design space featuring giant hysteresis, quadstability, multi-step snapping, tristability at zero compression, and compression-induced snapping between left and right-buckled states. Our strategy is general, simple to design and implement, and enables mechanical metamaterials and devices with advanced memory and sequential behavior.</p>

            <h2>Mode-coupling theory of the glass transition for a liquid in a periodic potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abolfazl Ahmadirahmat, Michele Caraglio, Vincent Krakoviack, Thomas Franosch</p>
            <p>We derive a microscopic theory for the structural dynamics in the vicinity of the glass transition for a liquid exposed to a one-dimensional periodic potential. The periodic potential breaks translational invariance, in particular, the density exhibits a periodic modulation. Using techniques familiar from solid-state theory, we define generalized intermediate scattering functions from fluctuating densities in wave-vector space. Exact equations of motion are derived within the Mori-Zwanzig projection-operator formalism reflecting the residual lattice symmetries. Due to the lack of rotational symmetry it is necessary to split the currents into components parallel and perpendicular to the modulation. We provide a closure of the equations in terms of a mode-coupling approximation for the force kernel. The theory reflects the usual analytic properties of correlation functions and encodes all phenomena known for mode-coupling theories. We prove that the theory reduces to the conventional mode-coupling theory in the case of vanishing amplitude of the modulation.</p>

            <h2>Efficient Generation of Second-Harmonic Propagating Spin Waves in a Thin, Out-of-Plane-Magnetized Ferromagnetic Film</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mathieu Moalic, Youenn Patat, Mateusz Zelent, Maciej Krawczyk</p>
            <p>Spin waves are attractive information carriers owing to their gigahertz-to-terahertz frequencies, nanometric wavelengths, and negligible Joule heating. Yet the efficient excitation of short-wavelength, high-frequency spin waves and the exploitation of nonlinear effects remain challenging. We propose a hybrid ferromagnetic nanostructure composed of a small, in-plane-magnetized rim (a magnonic nanocavity) exchange-coupled to an out-of-plane-magnetized region. Micromagnetic simulations show that a spatially uniform out-of-plane microwave field excites the rim's fundamental mode; its second harmonic is then coherently and efficiently launched into the second region of the structure, yielding propagating spin waves. The process can be realized in strip or disk geometries, providing excitation of plane-wave or radial spin waves, respectively. The conversion efficiency grows nonlinearly with the pump amplitude and can be further improved when the frequency of a higher-order standing wave in the nanocavity matches the second-harmonic frequency. The emission frequency is tunable via the bias magnetic field or the width of the nanocavity, suggesting a compact route toward on-chip, short-wavelength, high-frequency spin-wave sources for artificial neural networks.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V.L. Katkov, V.A. Osipov</p>
            <p>Electron mobility due to electron-phonon interaction is investigated for fully fluorinated/hydrogenated zig-zag carbon nanotubes containing one-dimensional alternating chains of carbon atoms with $\pi$-bonds. The behavior of mobility associated with changes in the tube diameter, coating type (F/H) and temperature is revealed. In particular, it is shown that the dependence of mobility on the diameter in such tubes is periodic with the chirality index, which is associated with the absence of scattering on TA phonons in the tubes with an even number of conducting chains due to mirror symmetry. The obtained small values of phonon-limited mobility indicate that tubes with one-dimensional conducting chains are more promising for use as gas sensors than as elements of electronic devices. Calculations are performed within the self-energy relaxation time approximation (SERTA) using the non-orthogonal tight-binding approach.</p>

            <p>Power and efficiency are fundamental criteria for evaluating the performance of thermodynamic cycles. However, it is generally impossible to maximize both simultaneously. In particular, achieving maximum efficiency inevitably leads to vanishing power as the cycle duration approaches infinity. A quantitative characterization of this trade-off yields significant theoretical and practical implications. In this letter, we analytically derive an exact bound constraining power and efficiency in low-dissipation finite-time heat engines. This bound specifies the maximum power attainable at any prescribed efficiency, thereby providing a benchmarking for evaluating the performance of heat engines.</p>

            <p>Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data, enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces challenges, including physical realization, output readout, and measurement-induced back-action. Here, we propose to implement quantum RC through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the mesoscopic physics applications.</p>

We implement AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuai Zhang, Zhishun Chen, Zhuoming Xie, Jun Song, Huiqiu Deng, Wangyu Hu, Jie Hou</p>
            <p>Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) are often regarded as penetrable interfaces to dislocation motion, yet recent studies suggest they can also act as strong barriers. The origin of this duality remains debated, particularly regarding the role of elastic interactions. Here, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate dislocation transmission across various tilt LAGBs in BCC Fe. The results show that transmission resistance varies widely with boundary-dislocation geometry. Contrary to the prevailing view that dislocation reactions dominate, elastic interactions between lattice and boundary dislocations emerge as the primary controlling factor. Screw and screw-like dislocations generate shear stresses that bend GB dislocations and produce strong barriers, whereas edge dislocations lack such stresses and transmit more readily. Consequently, barrier strength increases as the dislocation character angle decreases, with screw dislocations experiencing the strongest resistance. An analytical model is developed that quantitatively predicts the net transmission stress, in excellent agreement with simulations. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for LAGB-dislocation interactions and offer guidance for designing LAGB-strengthened materials.</p>

            <p>We compute the electron spin susceptibility in the pseudogap regime of the two-dimensional Hubbard model in the framework of a SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating magnetic order. The electrons are fractionalized in fermionic chargons with a pseudospin degree of freedom and bosonic spinons. The chargons are treated in a renormalized mean-field theory and order in a Néel or spiral magnetic state in a broad range around half-filling below a transition temperature $T^*$. Fluctuations of the spin orientation are captured by the spinons. Their dynamics is governed by a non-linear sigma model, with spin stiffnesses computed microscopically from the pseudospin susceptibility of the chargons. The SU(2) gauge group is higgsed in the chargon sector, and the spinon fluctuations prevent breaking of the physical spin symmetry at any finite temperature. The electron spin susceptibility obtained from the gauge theory shares many features with experimental observations in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors: the dynamical spin susceptibility $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ has a spin gap, the static uniform spin susceptibility $\kappa_s$ decreases strongly with temperature below $T^*$, and the NMR relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ vanishes exponentially in the low temperature limit if the ground state is quantum disordered. At low hole doping, $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ exhibits nematicity below a transition temperature $T_{\rm nem} < T^*$, and at larger hole doping in the entire pseudogap regime below $T^*$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaomiao Yin, Guanglei Han, Guowen Gong, Jun Kang, Changmin Xiong, Lijun Zhu</p>
            <p>Accurate quantification of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) is critical for the identification and applications of new spin-orbitronic effects. One of the most popular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the applied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during the anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization in a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we report that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization heterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni multilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT within the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current scaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our experiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most likely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion of the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and current-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the required switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by the domain wall depinning analysis. These results have advanced the understanding of magnetization switching of spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have shown that non-equilibrium effects can play a key role in cavity-based control of material phases, notably in systems with charge-density-wave order. Motivated by this, we extend the theory of the Eliashberg effect, originally developed for superconducting phases, to charge-density-wave phases. Starting from a minimal electronic model where superconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium, we introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an environment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic environment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which breaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order. In the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from continuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast, the charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity frequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct ordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point. These findings demonstrate that the scope of cavity-based non-thermal control of quantum materials is broader than at thermal equilibrium, and strongly depends on the targeted phases.</p>

            <p>Extending Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) promises direct access to anyonic statistics, yet remains challenging: on-demand anyon injection is hindered by integer-charged minimal excitations, and recent HOM experiments in the FQHE lack a fully consistent theoretical framework. Here we provide a general theory of time-resolved HOM interferometry in quantum Hall systems. Combining the nonequilibrium bosonized edge theory (NEBET) with the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative theory (UNEPT), we derive exact and perturbative relations obeyed by the relevant cross-correlations of chiral currents valid for spatially extended tunneling operators and generic quadratic edge dynamics. Then, within the Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, we analyze the width of the HOM dip for injected pulses carrying integer and fractional charges. We show that it is governed by the width of the pulses and, for the fractional charge, by a non-trivial power-law behavior of the scaling dimension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting recent experiments on anyonic statistics and electronic interferometry in the quantum Hall regime.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p>

In this approach, only one subbath at a time is actively involved in ED, dramatically reducing the computational cost by replacing a single large impurity problem with multiple smaller separate ones. Our method successfully reproduces key physical properties including particle-hole symmetry and Mott physics, while allowing for an extended bath representation at a fraction of the typical computational cost.</p>

            <p>Twisted graphene multilayers exhibit strong electronic correlations, which manifest in a range of experimental signatures. Yet how these signatures relate to each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band structure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay by correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands. We use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of electron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist angle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth in electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h) asymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands. Subsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust superconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry. Our measurements indicate that superconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead, its critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth in compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two. By combining a local probe with transport measurements, we uncover connections between superconductivity and thermodynamic correlation signatures that are not apparent from either technique in isolation, highlighting the power of our dual approach and establishing their dependence on interlayer twist angles in TTG.</p>

            <p>Energy has no definition, except that given by a conservation principle which essentially amounts to defining it as the elements of an open list of unknown cardinality. Entropy, identified by Shannon as information we lack, has too many definitions. This results in an unstable and hesitant interpretation of their link. Thermodynamics, the science of changes in form of energy, is phenomenological, all its laws are induced from observation. From the origin, the concept of energy is linked to the observer's knowledge, to the information he has: what and where to look and with what instruments. Thermodynamics only addresses the sensible world. It is Aristotelian. But this is disturbing if we consider that reason can give us access to Plato's intelligible world, the one that is beyond the sensible world and independent of us. This is disturbing if we consider that science can access to the intrinsic properties of things, those which are independent of us. This is disturbing if we have a purely Platonic conception of science. Hence the statistical mechanics approach ("The rational foundation of thermodynamics", J.W. Gibbs). This is the first pendulum movement of ideas, whose oscillations continue to this day, because unfortunately statistical mechanics introduces many inconsistencies, mainly due to the ergodic hypothesis. Luckily, these inconsistencies are all solved by Shannon's information theory. Sadly, information theory is too Aristotelian and too conceptual. Fortunately, Landauer principle makes it more \textquote{physical}. This is currently the latest attempt to bringing the notions of energy and information back to what is considered the right side of science, that of Plato. Landauer principle is now commonly regarded as a fundamental law of physics. Unpleasantly, it can be shown that this principle is not one.</p>

            <h2>Tracking photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with simulated time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lina Fransén, Benjamin Roux, Sonia Coriani, Saikat Nandi, Morgane Vacher</p>
            <p>Spiropyran is a prototype photoswitch that undergoes photoinduced ring-opening via C-O bond fission. The quantum yield for this photochemical reaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation proceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However, experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies have probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is unlikely to leave clear signatures. Here, we use non-adiabatic dynamics simulations in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopic calculations to investigate the possibility of tracking the photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen K-edge. The simulations predict that cleavage of the C-N bond results in a transient red-shift of the X-ray absorption. These results indicate a potential experimental route to gain a mechanistic understanding of the efficient photophysical relaxation that limits the efficiency of spiropyran-based photochromic systems.</p>

            <h2>Fourier Neural Operators for Time-Periodic Quantum Systems: Learning Floquet Hamiltonians, Observable Dynamics, and Operator Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihao Qi, Yang Peng, Christopher Earls</p>
            <p>Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control. However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover, FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing data from near-term quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Sun, Bowen Yang, Zongyuan Wang, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l+1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l-2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l+1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l-1)$ dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.</p>

            <h2>Conformal 3-point correlators in momentum space, method of subgraphs and the $1/N$ expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijin Li</p>
            <p>Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to few parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative expansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it closely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first few terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative result with the bootstrap data and discuss its application for the conductivity near the quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO, achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.</p>

            <p>Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers with heterogeneously spaced junctions are theoretically investigated. We consider unit cells with three junctions and characterize their interaction by spatially displaced fields defined by node fluxes. To solve this problem we define the system action and apply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines the equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be increased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same unit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an optimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth, while equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this method does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at different pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve gains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase matching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998 junctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal sub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can still be achieved at sub-optimal sizes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ippo Orii</p>
            <p>In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, such group actions do not automatically satisfy associativity. The obstruction is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose presence signals a failure of group associativity. In these cases, the symmetry structure is no longer described by an ordinary group, but instead by a $2$-group -- a group-like structure extended by a $1$-form symmetry. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahito Yamazaki</p>
            <p>While general quantum field theories (QFTs) have yet to be rigorously defined in mathematics, they have generated new mathematics and have served as a unifying principle connecting different branches of the subject. In 1989, Witten made a profound impact on the mathematical community by systematically constructing knot invariants via the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. One of the historical roots of knot invariants was integrable models, whose explanation in terms of QFT remained unsolved for decades. Recently, this problem was solved by a perturbative analysis of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, which provides a novel framework for understanding and unifying many different aspects of integrable models. In this article, we summarize the basic aspects of these developments for non-experts in both physics and mathematics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Keeling, E. Miles Stoudenmire, Mari-Carmen Bañuls, David R. Reichman</p>
            <p>The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases, such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a wide range of open quantum systems.</p>

Among the various multiplexing approaches, microwave SQUID multiplexing currently represents the state of the art, in particular for magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) readout. In this work, we demonstrate the successful operation of the latest generation of our microwave SQUID multiplexer-based readout system, based on a SQUID multiplexer tailored for MMC readout and a custom full-scale software-defined radio (SDR) electronics, capable of handling up to 400 channels. The system operates reliably across the entire 4-8 GHz frequency band and achieves sufficiently low flux noise levels in flux-ramp-demodulated readout. Our results confirm that our system is fully functional and provides a scalable path towards future large-scale, high-resolution MMC experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinjia Chen, Shuocang Zhang, Qiang Shi</p>
            <p>Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects, Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$ noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.</p>

            <p>Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.</p>

The method exploits the position dependence of a continuous, broadband magneto-optical trap operating on the 7.5 kHz-wide intercombination line of strontium. We show that the frequency sensitivity is fundamentally insensitive to the effective MOT laser linewidth. By applying active feedback on the MOT position to a dispersion-optimized frequency comb, which serves as the reference for stabilizing the MOT laser, we achieve a frequency instability below $4.4\times10^{-13}$ after 400 s of averaging in both the optical and radio-frequency domains, surpassing the performance of conventional hot-vapor modulation transfer spectroscopy. Our method is a broadly applicable alternative route to long-term frequency references in the high $10^{-14}$ range around 100 s.</p>

            <p>We implement an analogue Wheeler-DeWitt mini-universe constituted by a well-isolated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a time-independent conservative potential. In exact analogy with the Wheeler-DeWitt framework for the actual universe, our system has the fundamental problem of defining from within a meaningful time variable over which to order the events. Here, we partition the mini-universe into a bright and a dark sector, enabling entropy exchange between them through a potential barrier. We show that the Hamiltonian of the condensate in the bright sector is analogous to the one in canonical minisuperspace models. We define an entropic time and show with experimental data that it is robustly monotonic even when the bright sector undergoes several cycles that begin with a 'big bang' and end with a 'big crunch'. By tuning the barrier height, we control the rate of entropy production and thus the speed of the emergent entropic time and the dynamics of the bright universe. We finally derive an entropic time-dependent Schroedinger equation that could be considered as a generalization of the standard one, and use it to reproduce our data. This work experimentally validates the proposition that time in quantum cosmological models may not be fundamental, but instead emerges from thermodynamic gradients, while establishing a concrete experimental platform for evaluating several aspects of quantum gravity theories.</p>

Relying upon a field-theoretical description, statistical moments of the circulation turn out to be functionally dependent on specific {\it{optimal surfaces}} bounded by the circulation loops. Circulation is modeled in the optimal curved spaces with the help of scalar vertex operators that represent the multifractal density fluctuations of Gaussian-correlated vortex structures. We show that minimal surfaces are optimal within the inertial range, but subdominant deviations are expected to become significant for contours with linear dimensions close to the Kolmogorov dissipation length. As a case study, we demonstrate the model's applicability through a Monte Carlo evaluation of the circulation probability distribution function for a nonplanar contour, which is in excellent agreement with results of extensive direct numerical simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Barthelemy</p>
            <p>Many real-world networks, ranging from subway systems to polymer structures and fungal mycelia, do not form by the incremental addition of individual nodes but instead grow through the successive extension and intersection of lines or filaments. Yet most existing models for spatial network formation focus on node-based growth, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of systems built from spatially extended components. Here we introduce a minimal model for spatial networks, rooted in the iterative growth and intersection of lines-a mechanism inspired by diverse systems including transportation networks, fungal hyphae, and vascular structures. Unlike classical approaches, our model constructs networks by sequentially adding lines across a domain populated with randomly distributed points. Each line grows greedily to maximize local coverage, while subject to angular continuity and the requirement to intersect existing structures. This emphasis on extended, interacting elements governed by local optimization and geometric constraints leads to the spontaneous emergence of a core-and-branches architecture. The resulting networks display a range of non-trivial scaling behaviors: the number of intersections grows subquadratically; Flory exponents and fractal dimensions emerge consistent with empirical observations; and spatial scaling exponents depend on the heterogeneity of the underlying point distribution, aligning with measurements from subway systems. Our model thus captures key organizational features observed across diverse real-world networks, establishing a universal paradigm that goes beyond node-based approaches and demonstrates how the growth of spatially extended elements can shape the large-scale architecture of complex systems.</p>

For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever $d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the $d=3$ case.</p>

            <p>We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk this http URL results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.</p>

            <p>We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Dependent Defect Merging Induces Bifurcated Dynamics in Active Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Shichen Liu, Hao Wang, Heun Jin Lee, Rob Phillips, Matt Thomson</p>
            <p>Cytoskeletal networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, the mechanisms and dynamics of defect merging remain poorly understood. Here we report a geometry-tunable merging mechanism in microtubule-motor networks initiated by active crosslinking. We directly generate defects using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system in O-shaped and V-shaped networks, and observe that the defects can self-close. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the V-shaped networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to zip up cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack merges below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of overlapping boundary layers where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby merge the defects. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is tunable by the network geometry.</p>

            <p>Deconfined quantum critical points are intriguing transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm which are usually identified by the appearance of a continuous phase transition between locally ordered phases. Here, we reveal the presence of deconfined quantum critical points with unexplored properties. Contrary to previously known examples, we show that the phenomenon of spin-charge separation peculiar to interacting low dimensional fermions can allow for the appearance of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. We first infer this point by performing a field theory analysis of generic one-dimensional fermionic systems in the low energy limit. Subsequently, we derive a microscopic model where phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can take place. Here, by performing a numerical analysis we explicitly derive, among others, the gaps, local order parameters and correlation functions behavior, supporting the presence of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. Our results thus provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hannah Lange, Annika Böhler, Christopher Roth, Annabelle Bohrdt</p>
            <p>Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Sondheimer oscillations driven by commensurability between two quantizations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaodong Guo, Xiaokang Li, Lingxiao Zhao, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia</p>
            <p>The electrical conductivity of metallic crystals exhibits size effects when the electron mean free path exceeds the sample thickness. One such phenomenon, known as Sondheimer oscillations, was discovered decades ago. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field, have been hitherto treated with no reference to Landau quantization. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thicknesses ranging from 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m, and demonstrate that the amplitude of the first ten oscillations is determined by the quantum of conductance and a length scale that depends on the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We argue that this scaling is unexpected in semiclassical scenarios and it arises from the degeneracy of the momentum derivative of the cross-sectional area $A$ along the orientation of the magnetic field $\frac{\partial A}{\partial k_z}$ in cadmium, which couples Landau quantization to the discretization of $k_z$ imposed by the finite sample thickness. We show that the oscillating component of the conductivity is uniquely governed by fundamental constants and the ratio of two degeneracies, which acts as an inverted filling factor. Our conjecture is supported by the absence of such scaling in thin copper crystals.</p>

Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. The inherent nanoscale structuring produces a robust, spatially varying near-field response, establishing moiré superlattices as a platform for engineering light-matter interactions.</p>

            <h2>Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaotian Nie, Wei Zheng</p>
            <p>Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We show that, similar to the closed case, the first-order deviation from the instantaneous steady state is memoryless -- it depends only on the final parameters and not on the initial state or ramping path. When ramping the Hamiltonian, the linear response of observables is governed by the derivative of the retarded Green's function, as in closed systems. In contrast, ramping the dissipation gives rise to a different response, characterized by a high-order correlation function defined in the steady state. Our results offer a compact and physically transparent formulation of non-adiabatic response in open systems, and demonstrate that ramping dynamics can serve as a versatile tool for probing many-body correlations beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda</p>
            <p>Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a novel phase of periodically driven matter that exhibits robust subharmonic oscillations without requiring disorder. However, previous realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of polarization, either spontaneous or induced. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed ``unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals'' (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform/staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.</p>

            <p>Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples from the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conduction electrons instead of the monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conduction electron with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order from the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we find here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic states with spin-split electronic structure give rise to novel spintronic, magnonic, and electronic phenomena despite (near-) zero net magnetization. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting - $p$-wave - was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems. Recent theory identifies a distinct route to realise $p$-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations, termed $p$-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realisation of a metallic $p$-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalised conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localised magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space inversion symmetry but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation - thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for $p$-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our $p$-wave magnet exhibits a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity. Relativistic spin-orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break $T$ symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE, $\sigma_{xy}>600\,$S/cm, Hall angle $>3\,\%$), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin nodal planes found in the electronic structure of $p$-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the AHE.</p>

By combining high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved model, where leading scaling corrections are suppressed, with a finite-size scaling analysis informed by conformal field theory, we determine unbiased, accurate estimates of universal boundary operator product expansion coefficients of experimental relevance. Furthermore, we improve the value of the scaling dimension of the surface field at the special transition by the estimate $\hat{\Delta}_\sigma = 0.3531(3)$.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions and the $g$-wave symmetry. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.</p>

            <p>Aging limits lithium-ion battery lifetime and must be understood to improve durability and performance, requiring a detailed understanding of how aging alters the availability of cyclable lithium and the integrity of active particles. In this work, (de)lithiation mechanisms are examined and spatially-resolved at the microscale in aged graphite electrodes dismounted from a large format graphite/LiFePO4-Li(NiCoAl)O2 cell at 70% remaining capacity. A multi-technique workflow is employed, combining electrochemical methods with post-mortem structural and morphological analyses, and introducing synchrotron microX-ray 2D diffraction imaging as a technique to probe aged graphite, applied at C-rates from C/5 to C. In-plane and through-plane heterogeneities in graphite dynamics are evidenced, showing the presence of inactive regions localized in two dimensions. In these areas, particles are either disconnected (irreversibly lost) or kinetically limited (reactivated at a slow C-rate), with dead or slow particles exhibiting a wide range of compositions, from x = 0 to x = 1 in LixC6. These inactivated graphite particles are found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the depth of the aged negative electrode. In particular, the most inactivated region localizes at the negative electrode-separator interface, correlating to overworking graphite near the separator.</p>

Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J > 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.</p>

            <p>Chromium tri-halides Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) have recently become a focal point of research due to their intriguing low-temperature,layer-dependent magnetism that can be manipulated by an electric field. This makes them essential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are often related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for understanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase transition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to determine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal field interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods provide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic energetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion parameters $D\sigma$ and $D\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$ orbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear energy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden doublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the spin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are in good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the Nephelauxetic effect. Such precise measurements offer insights into the energy design of spintronic devices that utilize quantum state tuning within 2D magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform for emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and spintronics. However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) complicates spin and valley manipulation. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhances the SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding SOC strength and tunability. Here, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we reproducibly demonstrate spin-orbit splitting up to 1.5 meV - more than 1 order of magnitude higher than in pristine BLG. Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression via the perpendicular electric field. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish the SOC as a control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.</p>

            <p>Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a well-defined methodology called the multicollinear approach was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones. While previous research focuses on its matrix representation, the present work derives its operator formalism. We implement these new equations in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, which is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. Since the multicollinear approach was proposed for solving nonphysical properties and mathematical singularities in noncollinear functionals, we validate its accuracy in practical periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials.</p>

            <p>The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in neopentyl glycol (NPG) makes plastic crystals promising candidates for solid-state refrigerants that have lower environmental impact than traditional vapour compression fluids. However, optimising operational temperatures and low-pressure operability remains challenging without diminishing parameters including the accessible latent heat. Here, we implement a strategy to improve the viability of NPG derivatives as barocaloric refrigerants. We blend pentaglycerine with NPG to lower the phase transition temperature, then dope the blend with just 2% pentaerythritol to improve the phase transition reversibility. In comparison with NPG, this ternary system has a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change ($|\Delta S_{it,rev}|$ = 13.4 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span}$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction reveals that the temperature range of the first-order phase transition is broadened because the intermolecular hydrogen bond network is disrupted by the presence of molecular dopants. Dynamic effects are revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering, which shows reduced activation energies for the molecular rotational modes underpinning the entropic component of the barocaloric effect. We propose that exploiting the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular blends is an effective strategy for designing practicable molecular BCs.</p>

            <p>EuAuSb is a triangular-lattice Dirac semimetal in which a topological Hall effect has been observed to develop in association with a magnetically-ordered phase. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements have identified an incommensurate helical order in which individual ferromagnetic Eu$^{2+}$ layers rotate in-plane by $\sim$120$^{\circ}$ from one layer to the next. An in-plane magnetic field distorts the incommensurate order, eventually leading to a first order transition to a state that is approximately commensurate and that is continuously polarized as the bulk magnetization approaches saturation. From an analysis of the magnetic diffraction intensities versus field, we find evidence for a dip in the ordered in-plane moment at the same field where the topological Hall effect is a maximum, and we propose that this is due to field-induced quantum spin fluctuations. Our electronic structure calculations yield exchange constants compatible with the helical order and show that the bands near the Fermi level lose their spin degeneracy via a mechanism similar to that in the collinear altermagnets. We find that, unlike the even symmetry seen in the altermagnets, the spin-splitting in EuAuSb has odd-wave symmetry similar to that recently found in a number of coplanar magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>The quantum dimer magnet, with antiferromagnetic intradimer and interdimer Heisenberg exchange between spin-1/2 moments, is known to host an up/down - down/up singlet ground state when the intradimer exchange is dominant. Rare-earth-based quantum dimer systems with strong spin-orbit coupling offer the opportunity for tuning their magnetic properties by using magnetic anisotropy as a control knob. Here, we present bulk characterization and neutron scattering measurements of the quantum dimer magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$. We find that the Yb$^{3+}$ ions can be described by an effective spin-1/2 model at low temperatures and the system does not show signs of magnetic order down to 50 mK. The magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron spectroscopy data can be well-described by an isolated dimer model with highly anisotropic exchange that stabilizes a singlet ground state with a wavefunction up/up - down/down or up/up + down/down. Our results show that strong spin-orbit coupling can induce novel entangled states of matter in quantum dimer magnets.</p>

            <h2>Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Borges, Peter Lunts, Sung-Sik Lee</p>
            <p>We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM), using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group. Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.</p>

            <h2>Extended Yard Sale model of wealth distribution on Erdős-Rényi random networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolás Vazquez Von Bibow, Juan I. Perotti</p>
            <p>Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erdős-Rényi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.</p>

For monolayer excitons, topological bands and in-gap helical edge states can emerge near the energy of 2p states.</p>

            <p>We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nejc Blaznik, Dries van Oosten, Peter van der Straten</p>
            <p>Nondestructive spin-resolved imaging of ultracold atomic gases requires calculating the differences of the refractive indices seen by two circular probe polarizations. Perfect overlap of the two images, corresponding to two different polarizations, is required well below the feature size of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate that the birefringence of atoms in magnetic field gradients results in polarization-dependent aberrations in the image, which deteriorates the overlap. To that end, we develop a model that couples atomic tensor polarizability with position-dependent spin orientation and yields aberration predictions for accumulated phase shifts in arbitrary field geometries. Applied to data from an ultra-cold atomic cloud trapped in a Ioffe-Pritchard trap, the model quantitatively reproduces the observed distortion across a range of temperatures. A residual offset of $\sim1\;\mu\mathrm{m}$ remains even under uniform field conditions, likely due to optical asymmetries. For images obtained through off-axis holography, the full complex field of the probe enables post-processing removal of all magnetically induced aberrations through a single numerically calculated Fourier-space phase mask.</p>

            <p>Spatially resolved strain measurements are crucial to understanding the properties of engineering materials. Although strain measurements utilizing techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction offer high spatial resolution, they are limited to surface or thin samples. X-ray diffraction methods, including Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging and X-ray topography, enable strain measurements deep inside bulk materials but face challenges in simultaneously achieving both high spatial resolution and large field-of-view. Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) offers a promising solution with its ability to image bulk crystals at the nanoscale while offering a field-of-view approaching a few hundred $\mu$m. However, an inverse modeling framework to explicitly relate the angular shifts in DFXM to the strain and lattice rotation tensors is lacking. In this paper, we develop such an inverse modeling formalism. Using the oblique diffraction geometry, enabling access to noncoplanar symmetry-equivalent reflections, we demonstrate that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible. We also develop the computational framework to both forward calculate the anticipated angular shifts and reconstruct the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for an individual pixel from DFXM experiments. Finally, utilizing the established formalism and computational framework, we present methods for sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific angles of DFXM. The developed sensitivity analysis also enables explicit computation of the errors associated with the reconstruction of each component. The formalism, the computational framework, and the sensitivity analysis established in this paper should assist both the interpretation of past DFXM experiments and the design of future DFXM experiments.</p>

            <p>Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo this http URL also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.</p>

            <h2>Elastic Metastability: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions in Nanostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renjie Zhao, Yiquan Zhang, Chenglin Luo</p>
            <p>The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mara Lozano, Hong-Yi Xie, Bruno Uchoa</p>
            <p>Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states, characterized by an envelope function with finite vorticity in momentum space. This vorticity is determined by the underlying topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless of the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate how band topology affects exciton properties, offering a framework for predicting light-matter interactions in topological materials with flat bands.</p>

            <p>Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in modulating protein dynamics in cellular and in vitro environments. Polymeric crowders such as dextran and Ficoll are known to induce entropic forces, including depletion interactions, that promote structural organization, but the nanoscale consequences for protein dynamics remain less well understood. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European XFEL to probe the dynamics of the protein ferritin in solutions containing sucrose, dextran, and Ficoll. We find that depletion-driven short-range attractions combined with long-range repulsions give rise to intermediate-range order (IRO) once the polysaccharide overlap concentration $c^*$ is exceeded. These IRO features fluctuate on microsecond to millisecond timescales, strongly modulating the collective dynamics of ferritin. The magnitude of these effects depends sensitively on crowder type, concentration, and molecular weight. Normalizing the crowder concentration by $c^*$ reveals scaling behavior in ferritin self-diffusion with a crossover near 2$c^*$, marking a transition from depletion-enhanced mobility to viscosity-dominated slowing. Our results demonstrate that bulk properties alone cannot account for protein dynamics in crowded solutions, underscoring the need to include polymer-specific interactions and depletion theory in models of crowded environments.</p>

            <p>We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c =-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), its relationship with collective operation as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.</p>

Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits, synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and beyond.

            <p>We define quantum chaos and integrability in open quantum many-body systems as a dynamical property of single stochastic realizations, referred to as quantum trajectories. This definition relies on the predictions of random matrix theory applied to the subset of the Liouvillian spectrum involved in each quantum trajectory. Our approach, which we name spectral statistics of quantum trajectories (SSQT), enables a natural distinction between transient and steady-state quantum chaos as general phenomena in open setups. We test the generality and reliability of the SSQT criterion on several dissipative systems, further showing that an open system with a chaotic structure can evolve towards either a chaotic or integrable steady state. We apply our theoretical framework to two driven-dissipative bosonic systems. First, we study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, an example of quantum simulator, clarifying the interplay of integrability, transient, and steady-state chaos across its phase diagram. Our analysis shows the existence of an emergent dissipative quantum chaotic phase, whereas the classical and semi-classical limits display integrable behavior. In this regime, chaos arises from the quantum and classical fluctuations associated with the dissipation mechanisms. Second, we investigate dissipative quantum chaos in the dispersive readout of a transmon qubit: a measurement technique ubiquitous in superconducting-based quantum hardware. Through the SSQT, we distinguish regimes where the performance of the measurement instrument can be connected to the integrable or chaotic nature of the underlying driven-dissipative bosonic system. Our work offers a general understanding of the integrable and chaotic dynamics of open quantum systems and paves the way for the investigation of dissipative quantum chaos and its consequences on state-of-the-art noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a nonthermal parameter for a superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group methods and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</p>

We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</p>

            <p>Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</p>

            <p>Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point.

Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</p>

            <p>Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.</p>

Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</p>

            <h2>Nonabelian ferromagnets with three-body interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexios P. Polychronakos, Konstantinos Sfetsos</p>
            <p>We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. Using a mean field approach, we uncover an intricate phase structure, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.</p>

            <h2>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhumita Rano, Henrik R. Larsson</p>
            <p>To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computation of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue He, Daniel Escudero</p>
            <p>Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2), and accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.</p>

            <h2>A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weitang Li, Jiajun Ren, Jun Yan</p>
            <p>Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</p>

            <h2>Noise-induced Zeno-like effect in a spin-chain quantum battery</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maulana M. Fajar, Beta N. Pratiwi, Subur Pramono, Gagus K. Sunnardianto, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries, which are energy-storage or state-storage devices that exploit unique quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here, we demonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery within the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances computational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time parameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find that not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For instance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but its discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing the battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip channels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields low storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel can combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the high-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated charging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging behavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release. These results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental decoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced charging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the spin-chain quantum battery.</p>

            <p>Batteries with liquid alkali-metal negative electrodes offer a route to compact, high-performance energy storage. Innovation in alkali-metal management, i.e., controlled storage, release and transport of liquid alkali metal, can enable simpler and cheaper cell designs. Porous carbons have emerged as potential host materials for liquid alkali metals. Here, we study the wetting interactions between porous carbon hosts and liquid sodium-potassium alloy (NaK) as a function of carbon host morphology and surface functionalization via X-ray computed tomography. While as-received carbon samples show no affinity towards NaK, heat-treated carbon is spontaneously infiltrated with NaK filling almost the entire pore volume. We explore how forced wetting partially fills pores of NaK-repellent hosts, showing large differences in pore filling based on the average pore size of the host material. In electrochemical discharge experiments, we show that both as-received and heat-treated carbon felt enable high areal capacities beyond 40 mAh cm-2. However, the heat-treated carbon shows ten times lower overpotential. Finally, we demonstrate how heat-treated carbon felt can enable capillary transport of NaK. In summary, this study elucidates important aspects of the interactions between liquid alkali metals and porous carbon hosts, generating insights into possible applications in liquid alkali-metal batteries.</p>

            <h2>Wilson-Loop-Ideal Bands and General Idealization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiabin Yu, Biao Lian, Shinsei Ryu</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry is universally bounded from below by Wilson-loop windings. In this work, we define an isolated set of bands to be Wilson-loop-ideal, if their quantum metric saturates the Wilson-loop lower bound. The definition naturally incorporates the known Chern-ideal and Euler-ideal bands, and allows us to define other types of ideal bands, such as Kane-Mele $Z_2$-ideal bands. In particular, we find that an isolated set of two $Z_2$-ideal bands with non-singular nonabelian Berry curvature always admits a Chern-ideal gauge (i.e., effectively behaving as two decoupled Chern-ideal bands), even in the absence of any global good quantum number (such as spin). This enables the direct construction of fractional topological insulator wavefunctions. We further propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that achieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band mixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have smooth projectors similar to isolated bands. We apply the constructed flows to the realistic model of $3.89^\circ$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and a moiré Rashba model, and numerically find Chern-ideal and $Z_2$-ideal states, respectively, with relative error in the integrated quantum metric below $5\times 10^{-3}$. Our general definition of Wilson-loop-ideal bands and general procedure of constructing Wilson-loop-ideal states provide a solid basis for future study of novel correlated physics.</p>

            <p>In single molecule toroics (SMTs) atomic spins and orbital currents generate magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, endowed with both magnetic and electric dipole symmetries, which can enable spin control via magnetoelectric effects as well as the development of robust qubits. In the archetypal Dy$_3$ SMT, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is challenging to detect and control. Larger molecular rings can offer an enhanced toroidal response amenable to direct observation and manipulation. Here we report SMT properties for the $3d$-$4f$ icosanuclear molecular ring Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$, displaying toroidal excitations of unprecedented magnitude and energy dispersion spanning a $\sim$62 billion dimensional toroidal space. We show these properties can be modeled using an ab initio-parameterised transfer matrix approach yielding excellent agreement with experiments. To assess the bulk toroidal polarization attainable in this system, we introduce the molar toroidal susceptibility $\xi$, a thermodynamic linear response function measuring the SMT finite-temperature toroidal polarization induced by a magnetic field with a small non-vanishing curl. Direct calculation of $\xi$ for Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$ reveals a significant finite-temperature ground state toroidal polarization which should be amenable to experimental detection via spatially-focused magnetic field curls, as attainable e.g. using focused femtosecond laser pulses. Our findings could thus pave the way for direct observation and manipulation of molecular toroidal moments.</p>

            <p>Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) is a promising organic molecule for applications in quantum information because of its thermal stability, efficient processing, and potential as a spin qubit. The deposition of VOPc in different molecular orientations allows the properties to be customized for integration into various devices. However, such customization has yet to be fully leveraged to alter its intrinsic properties, particularly optical emission. Normally, VOPc films on dielectric substrates emit a broad photoluminescence peak in the near-infrared range, attributed to transitions in the Pc ring from its pi orbital structure. In this work, we demonstrate that the dominant optical transition of VOPc can be shifted by over 250 meV through the controlled deposition of thin films on van der Waals material substrates. The weak interactions with van der Waals materials allow the molecules to uniquely self-assemble, resulting in modified optical behavior modulated by molecular phase and thickness. This work connects the self-assembling properties of molecules with their altered electronic structures and the resulting optical emission.</p>

            <p>We consider a coupled system of Dirac operators that finds applications as a macroscopic model of spin and valley polarized gated rhombohedral graphene (RHG) with an arbitrary number of layers as well as in replica models of Floquet topological insulators. We classify all quantum anomalous Hall phases that are compatible with the model and show that a bulk-edge correspondence between bulk phases and chiral edge states carrying a quantized anomalous Hall charge applies. When the displacement field is sufficiently small compared to the inter-layer coupling in the RHG application, we retrieve the known phases where the charge is given by the number of graphene layers. When the displacement field increases, we identify all possible topological phase transitions and corresponding quantized chiral edge charges. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings.</p>

            <p>Dirac surface states in a topological insulator (TI) with proximity-induced superconductivity offer a promising platform for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana physics. However, in TIs, the Josephson effect is usually observed in regimes where transport is dominated by either substantial bulk conduction channels or unipolar surface states. In this work, we demonstrate gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson current in lateral Josephson junction (JJ) devices based on bulk-insulating (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For thinner films, the supercurrent exhibits pronounced gate-tunable ambipolar behavior and is significantly suppressed as the chemical potential approaches the Dirac point, yet persists across it. In contrast, thicker films exhibit a much weaker ambipolar response. Moreover, we find that the supercurrent becomes significantly less resilient to external magnetic fields when the chemical potential is tuned near the Dirac point in both thickness regimes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the ambipolar behavior of these TI JJ devices and attribute the asymmetric supercurrent observed in thicker TI films to the coexistence of Dirac surface states and bulk conduction channels. The demonstration of gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson transport in MBE-grown TI films paves the way for realizing Dirac-surface-state-mediated topological superconductivity and establishes a foundation for future exploration of electrically tunable Majorana modes.</p>

This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.</p>

The system exploits geometric asymmetry and utilizes the connection between the additional energy degeneracy point (AEDP) and current circulation for precise parameter detection. In the low-temperature, low-bias regime, with baths chemical potentials aligned near the degenerate energy, we find that a balanced Wheatstone bridge condition emerges when the direction of current circulation reverses, providing a direct means to determine the unknown hopping strength. We further examine the impact of environmental interactions, demonstrating that the device remains functional under moderately strong dephasing and particle losses, though extreme environmental effects eventually degrade performance. Extending the analysis to general operating conditions, we show that the device continues to function effectively at higher voltages and temperatures. Our results highlight geometric asymmetry as a robust and practical tool for quantum metrology.</p>

Unlike previously studied time-dependent integrable models, which are rooted in the classical Yang-Baxter structure and associated Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, our approach is based on the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov framework and the quantum Yang-Baxter algebra. We demonstrate that the dynamics is integrable for a class of exchange couplings $J(t)$ of the form $\lambda t + p(t) \pm \sqrt{(\lambda t + p(t))^2 + 4/3}$, where $p(t)$ is an arbitrary periodic function, and construct the corresponding many-body wavefunction. We also discuss extensions to other one-dimensional integrable models with linear dispersion, such as Gross-Neveu and Thirring. Our results broaden the domain of time-dependent integrability to a genuinely quantum class of models and provide a new platform for exploring coherent nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>We study interaction-driven quantum phases in a two-dimensional generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) defined on a square lattice with inequivalent nearest-neighbor hopping, next-nearest-neighbor hopping and a staggered on-site potential. In the non-interacting limit, the model hosts either a quadratic band touching (QBT) at the Brillouin-zone center or symmetry-protected Dirac nodes, depending on microscopic parameters. In the parameter regime with a QBT, our self-consistent Hartree-Fock analysis shows that weak to intermediate interactions can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and stabilize a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase with a finite Chern number. Interestingly, this QAH phase is found to weakly break lattice-symmetries, leading to a small but finite nematic bond order. This is in contrast to the standard QAH phase in checkerboard lattice, which preserves all lattice symmetries. Additionally, we find an enhanced bond-nematic Dirac semimetallic (BNDS) phase due to asymmetric hopping, which is thought to be absent in the Hartree-Fock approach. In the parameter regimes where QBT splits into two Dirac nodes, the QAH phase survives up to a finite staggered on-site potential. However, as the staggered potential increases, the QAH phase is suppressed while the BNDS phase grows stronger.</p>

With a recently developed Bloch state tomography, we measure the expectation values of three Pauli matrices in 2D quasi-momentum space plus 1D time [(2+1)D], and then respectively extract the Berry curvature and the corresponding Berry connection. By integrating the product of these two quantities, we obtain the CS invariants near $\pm 1$ and 0, which are consistent with theoretical predictions.

            <p>We investigate Ising superconductivity in two archetypal intrinsic superconductors, monolayer 1H-TaS$_2$ and 1H-NbSe$_2$, in a bottom-up approach. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parameterizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, the screened interaction is evaluated microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In direct space, the screened potential displays for both systems long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign. Upon scaling, the oscillation pattern becomes universal, with the periodic features locked to the lattice. Solving the momentum-resolved gap equations, a chiral ground state with p-like symmetry is generically found. Due to the larger Ising spin-orbit coupling, the chiral gap is more anisotropic in TaS$_2$ than in NbSe$_2$. This is reflected in tunneling spectra displaying V-shaped features for the former, in quantitative agreement with low-temperature scanning tunneling experiments on TaS$_2$. At the same time, our results reconcile the apparent discordance with hard gap tunneling spectra reported for the sibling NbSe$_2$.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recent discovery of metallic surface states in the d-electron Kondo insulator candidates FeSi and FeSb2, along with some recent reports of magnetic correlations in the surface transport properties of FeSi, we have investigated the low temperature surface magnetotransport properties of FeSb2. By using a Corbino disk transport geometry, we were able to isolate the electrical transport properties of a single surface of our samples and study the [110] and [101] naturally forming faces separately. Studying the relationship between the applied magnetic field, current direction and crystal symmetry has allowed us to separate possible contributions to the magnetotransport anisotropy. Unlike previous studies of SmB6 surface states, we find no two-dimensional Drude-like dependence on field orientation relative to current direction, but instead a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that appears to originate from local moment scattering with a well defined easy-axis along the [100] direction. We compare these results with the magnetotransport properties of the conducting surface states on the [111] facet of FeSi. We also find evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface crossover, extending below 1 K, which implies that the electrical transport at the surface of these materials is carried by a thin, but 3D conducting channel, which is inconsistent with the lower dimensional states expected for a strong topological insulator.</p>

            <p>The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, is remarkably successful at describing numerous many-body phenomena. However, due to the small class of problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t<<U$, occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of realistic fermionic Hubbard models.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions, due to their topological stability and high mobility, are strong candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices. To advance their practical applications, a detailed understanding of their nucleation and current-driven dynamics is essential. We investigate the formation and manipulation of skyrmions in a square nano structure (200 $\times$ 200 nm$^{2}$, 1 nm thick) of PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers subjected to nano second current pulses with magnitude ranging from (1-5)$\times$10$^{11}$ A/m$^2$. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate controlled motion of skyrmion under different types of spin-transfer torque (STT). The calculated skyrmion Hall angle (SkH) for Slonczewski type STT is ${\theta_{SkH}^{SL}} = 89.53^{\circ}$ for PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers which ensures the edge accululation of skyrmion like a track within the nano structure and we extend this idea further for different shape engineering of skyrmion in 4d tranisition metal multilayers by manipulating the magnitude and direction of current pulses. Next, we investigate the influence of voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy ranging from (1.4 - 4.2) $\times$ 10$^6$ J/m$^3$ with external magnetic field B$_{ext}$ = 2 T, and (0 - 2.8) $\times$ 10$^6$ J/m$^3$ with B$_{ext}$ = 3 T respectively, on skyrmion dynamics for designing anisotropy-engineered barriers to guide their trajectories in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers. We use further these barriers to implement basic logic operations, including OR and AND gates, with skyrmions representing binary states. The calculatd skyrmion Hall angle for Zhang-Li type STT in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers is ${\theta_{SkH}^{ZL}} = 3.26^{\circ}$. Consequently, the skyrmions propagate predominantly along the direction of the applied current with minimal deflection, a feature that renders them highly suitable for logic operations.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic Topological Dice Flat Band in Yttrium Monochloride Electrides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianqi Zhong, Songyuan Geng, Haoxiang Li, Benjamin T. Zhou</p>
            <p>In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and characterized by a high Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = \pm 4$. In particular, the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\pm K$ and leads to the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without any extrinsic band engineering.</p>

            <h2>Extracting Phonon Quasiparticles from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjing Li, Yong Lu, Fawei Zheng</p>
            <p>Phonon anharmonicity are ubiquitous in real materials, creating finite phonon lifetimes. These effects are crucial for understanding thermal properties and phase stability. In this work, we define optimal phonon quasiparticles as those that maximize their lifetimes, and prove that the information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these knowledge, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes, frequencies and lifetimes. We applied this method to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, revealing their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and obtaining the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons and magnons.</p>

            <h2>Tensorial Model of Chiral Smectic C Liquid Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingmin Xia, Jinbing Wu, Yucen Han</p>
            <p>We propose a continuum tensorial model for chiral smectic C (SmC$^*$) liquid crystals using a tensor-valued order parameter $\mathbf{Q}$ to describe orientational order and a real-valued order parameter $\delta\rho$ to capture layer modulation. This model accounts for the coupled effects of nematic alignment, smectic layering, chirality and spontaneous polarisation inherent in SmC$^*$ systems. The model is validated through a series of numerical experiments -- helix, bistable switching, bookshelf and chevron, and defect in SmC$^*$. Our results highlight the model's capability to describe complex phenomena in SmC$^*$ liquid crystals, providing a robust foundation for further theoretical and applied studies on phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Packing, Phase Separation and Interface Compatibility in Reversibly Crosslinked Polymers</h2>

            <p>Vitrimers are a class of crosslinked polymer that are capable of undergoing bond exchange reactions, allowing structural reorganization while maintaining overall network integrity. Two key features that are particularly relevant when this vitrimer concept is used to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends are how they affect the (i) bulk polymer density and (ii) interfacial activity of the crosslink groups. To probe these issues, we model both a bulk polymer melt and a thin film of a polymer melt both with explicit small molecular crosslinkers, in the associative limit, i.e., when the number of crosslinks are fixed. We show that the bulk density and the distribution of stickers within a polymer matrix is strongly influenced by their size and interactions with the base polymer. Specifically, when the crosslinkers are chemically compatible with the base polymer, then the overall packing fraction increases, regardless of crosslinker size, while it decreases when crosslinkers are incompatible with the polymers. Similarly, the crosslinkers segregate preferentially to the polymer-air interface when they are incompatible with the polymer chains, leading to a reduction interfacial tension. Thus, these incompatible crosslinkers should help in affecting both the miscibility of polymer blends, and also their compatibility by creating copolymer structures at the interface. These results demonstrate the key role of crosslinker-polymer interactions and crosslinker size on the structural and interfacial properties of vitrimer melts.</p>

            <h2>Kinetic equation from Landau level basis: Beyond relaxation-time approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kitinan Pongsangangan</p>
            <p>The purpose of this paper is to formulate a kinetic theory describing transport properties of electrons in a uniform magnetic field of arbitrary magnitude. Exposing an electronic system to a constant magnetic field quenches its energy bands into a series of discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. The Landau-level states, exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation in a constant background magnetic field, are natural and suitable basis to use, especially, for the investigation of strong-magnetic-field phenomena. Starting from the Keldysh formalism, we derive the quantum kinetic equation from the Landau-level basis. As an illustration, we apply the kinetic equation to calculate the electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Path integral approach to quantum thermalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Altland, Kun Woo Kim, Tobias Micklitz</p>
            <p>We introduce a quasiclassical Green function approach describing the unitary yet irreversible dynamics of quantum systems effectively acting as their own environment. Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory, notably the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G \Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in regimes of strong entanglement.</p>

            <p>We propose an epidemic compartment model, which includes mortality caused by the disease, but excludes demographic birth and death processes. Individuals are represented by random walkers, which are in one of the following states (compartments) S (susceptible to infection), E (exposed: infected but not infectious corresponding to the latency period), I (infected and infectious), R (recovered, immune), D (dead). The disease is transmitted with a certain probability at contacts of I to S walkers. The compartmental sojourn times are independent random variables drawn from specific (here Gamma-) distributions. We implement this model into random walk simulations. Each walker performs an independent simple Markovian random walk on a graph, where we consider a Watts-Strogatz (WS) network. Only I walkers may die. For zero mortality, we prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium for basic reproduction number ${\cal R}_0 > 1$ and for which the disease free (globally healthy) state is unstable. We explore the effects of long-range-journeys (stochastic resetting) and mortality. Our model allows for various interpretations, such as certain chemical reactions, the propagation of wildfires, and in population dynamics.</p>

            <p>Supercooled liquids undergo a rapid change in dynamics as they are cooled to their glass transition temperature and turn from a flowing liquid into an amorphous solid. Depending on how steeply the viscosity changes with temperature around the glass transition, glass formers are classified as strong or fragile. An empirical relation exists between the fragility of the liquid and the broadness of its relaxation spectrum. However, the microscopic origins of this correlation remain unclear and its generality has been debated\cite. Here, we demonstrate that this relationship is inverted in organic materials with ionic interactions. We introduce a novel class of materials consisting of highly charged hydrophobic polymers cross-linked via moderated ionic interactions, and show that these combine a strong glass transition with an unusually broad mechanical relaxation spectrum. By surveying a large variety of ionic liquids, polymerized ionic liquids, and ionomers, we show that all these charged materials follow a trend between fragility and relaxation broadness that is opposite to that of non-charged materials. This finding suggests a special role of long-ranged ionic interactions in vitrification and opens up a route toward developing new materials that combine the processability of strong glass formers with the mechanical dissipation of polymers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vansh Kaushik, Sayan Choudhury, Tanay Nag</p>
            <p>We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model, which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number. Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic signature of a topological (trivial) phase.</p>

            <p>The direct integration of high-performance ferroelectric oxides with silicon remains challenging due to lattice mismatch, thermal incompatibility, and the need for high-temperature epitaxial growth. Here, a hybrid integration approach is demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first transferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector substrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant enables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about 30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with conventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr, Ba). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane cube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization 10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable switching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we extract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on conventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost effective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon and offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics.</p>

            <p>We revisit the irreversibility of the pendulum with time-dependent angular frequency, considered in a classical paper by K. Husimi. He introduced a parameter that measures the adiabaticity of a process utilizing an adiabatic invariant for the equation of motion of the pendulum. With this adiabaticity parameter, Husimi showed the irreversibility of the pendulum for a cyclic process, which is reminiscent of the Planck principle in thermodynamics, based on the microscopic mechanics. In this study, we generalize the argument by Husimi to a damped pendulum with friction, and highlight the role of conservation of a phase-space area on the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter. Moreover, we also investigate the second law of thermodynamics and its generalization for a general non-cyclic process as well as a cyclic process, and elucidate how the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter impacts on this law. In particular, for a general non-cyclic process, we show the law of entropy non-decrease for the pendulum without friction by using the property of the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter.</p>

            <p>Ferrons are quantum excitations of electric polarization in ferroelectrics and electric analogues of magnons but have lacked direct experimental verification at room temperature. We harness the coupling of soft phonons and ferroelectric order in layered NbOX2 (X = I, Br, Cl) to generate, detect, and control giant ferrons, creating a new class of ultralow-power, chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources. Multiple ferron modes produce intense, narrowband THz emission with quality factors up to 228 and radiation efficiencies up to five orders of magnitude greater than state of the art semiconductor emitters. Resonant excitation of a high-Q ferron mode achieves efficiencies two orders of magnitude higher than intense lithium niobate THz sources. We further demonstrate direct, non-volatile electric-field control of ferron oscillations. These findings provide evidence for multiple ferrons and establish Ferronics as a foundational platform for light- and field-driven control of quantum order, with broad impact on ultrafast electronics, photonics, quantum technologies, and next-generation wireless communication.</p>

            <p>In the recently discovered V-based kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, and Cs), superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave (CDW) order, raising a fundamental concern on the superconducting gap structure of such kagome superconductors in the presence of CDW orders. Here, we report directional soft point-contact Andreev reflection (SPCAR) spectroscopy measurements on the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, revealing compelling evidence for the existence of a strongly anisotropic superconducting gap pairing state. The SPCAR spectra measured with current injected parallel to the $ab$-plane exhibit an in-gap single conductance peak, in contrast to those of SPCAR spectra: a double-peak structure in the perpendicular direction. These spectra are well described by an anisotropic single-gap BTK model. The extracted superconducting gaps comprise an isotropic large gap and a strongly anisotropic gap, originating from different Fermi surface sheets. Quantitative analysis reveals an anisotropy around $\ sim$70\% with a gap minimum of about 0.15 meV. These results shed new light on the unconventional multiband pairing states in kagome superconductors.</p>

            <p>Controlling the collective motion of epithelial cell populations is fundamental for understanding multicellular self-organization and for advancing tissue engineering. Under spatial confinement, cells are known to exhibit either vortex rotation or oscillatory motion depending on boundary geometry, but the mechanisms governing transitions between these states remain unclear. Here, we investigated the collective motion of MDCK cells confined within a doublet circular boundary, where the confinement aspect ratio, defined as the distance between the centers of two circles relative to their radius, can be tuned by varying the degree of overlap. When the overlap is large, cells form a stable vortex. Increasing the confinement aspect ratio destabilizes this vortex and induces oscillatory motion characterized by periodic reversals of migration direction, before ultimately transitioning into disordered dynamics. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we developed simulations of self-propelled particles incorporating local alignment (LA) and contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). The model successfully reproduced the experimentally observed transitions from vortices to oscillatory motion and further revealed that an appropriate balance between LA and CIL is critical for stabilizing vortex pairs with velocity reversals. Our findings demonstrate that the confinement aspect ratio serves as a minimal control parameter governing transitions in the collective dynamics of epithelial monolayers.</p>

The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <p>Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.</p>

            <p>Domain switching is the cornerstone of ferroelectric materials. Most associated functionalities can be tuned via domain switching, including but not limited to piezoelectricity, thermal conductivity, domain wall conductivity and topological structures. However, achieving the full potential of reversible ferroelectric domain switching is restricted by the incomplete access to the entire ferroelectric texture space, as well as the memory effects and energy dissipation associated with the hysteretic nature of ferroelectrics. The manipulation of domain switching behaviour is moderately attainable in epitaxial heterostructures by exploiting the valence or lattice mismatch at heterointerfaces, which is generally constrained by the necessity for two dimensional architectures. In this study, domain-engineered bulk ferroelectric heterostructures (DE-BFH), constructed via elemental partitioning, are employed to unleash full potential of bulk ferroelectrics, providing comprehensive control of domain switching characteristics and adjustable reversibility within the entire range of ferroelectric texture space. Exemplar DE-BFH ceramics exhibit unprecedented enhancement in reversible electrostrain and stability in both axial and shear modes, including a record high peak to peak shear strain up to 0.9% at intermediate field levels, confirmed by digital image correlation measurements and in-situ synchrotron XRD studies. The advancement of domain switching behaviour in DE-BFH could also promote development of new types of lead-free piezoelectric devices, including actuators, energy harvesters, multiple state memory devices, and domain wall switch. Moreover, design concept of DE-BFH could contribute to the creation of distinctive ferroelastic, ferromagnetic, and multiferroic materials by broadening its scope to the entire ferroic family, encompassing polycrystalline, single-crystal, and thin-film forms.</p>

            <p>Orbital-selective correlations have been observed to play an important role in Fe-based superconductors. Here, in contrast to previous site-local Mott transition-based origins, we present a band-theory-based mechanism for orbital-selective physics in monolayer FeSe, for which only electron pockets appear. Underlying our mechanism is our density functional theory (DFT)-based observation that, for the electron pockets, antiferromagnetic fluctuations are strongly coupled to electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals but weakly coupled to those in $\{xz,yz\}$ orbitals. Symmetry-arguments reveal that this orbital selective coupling originates from the different intertwined orbital and Fe-site sublattice Bloch wavefunctions for these two sets of orbitals, specifically, the $x^2-y^2$ orbitals can be Fe-site localized. The strong coupling of electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals to the magnetic fluctuations enables orbital-selective electronic renormalizations that can account for important features of our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our symmetry-required mechanism for orbital selective physics can be generalized to a range of crystal space groups with four-fold and six-fold screw axes.</p>

            <p>Polar topology, an analogue of the magnetic topology, serves as a large playground for exotic physical phenomena with a wide range of multifunctional applications. Polar vortices and skyrmions are representative polar topologies that have been predicted to significantly enhance the functionality and information density of nanoelectronic devices due to their ultrasmall dimensions. Despite these advantages, the practical realization of polar topologies in devices is impeded by the intrinsic challenges associated with their controlled motion and manipulation. Therefore, harnessing vortex manipulation-such as motion, on demand creation, annihilation, and shape transformation-is essential for practical device integration. However, vortex motion is often challenged by intrinsic physical limitations in collective lattice distortions and strong pinning effects from the surrounding environment, which remains elusive. In this study, we present real time observation of vortex motion in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, achieved through the application of localized pulsed electric fields and trailing bias fields from a conductive tip. Notably, the vortices exhibit reversible motion in response to the field direction. Furthermore, by precisely manoeuvring the conductive Atomic-Force-Microscopy tip along specific trajectories, we achieved controlled vortex reshaping, with reconfigured vortices showing remarkable stability over extended periods. This underline physical mechanism is further pinpointed by phase-field simulations, which revealed that the motion of the vortex boundary is controlled through the switching of the zigzag patterns of the vortex core. This study highlights the feasibility of harnessing vortex dynamics through external stimuli, advancing the fundamental physical understanding and prospects for next-generation polar vortex-based nanoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Scale Modeling and Predictive Control of Active Brownian Particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadra Saremi, Amirhossein Ahmadkhan Kordbacheh</p>
            <p>Active Brownian particles (ABPs) function as self-driving agents that display non-equilibrium behavior through their pairwise interactions which lead to phase separation and vortex patterns in both soft matter and living systems. A multiscale approach needs to link particle-level random motion to collective density evolution for proper management of these dynamic systems. Our research delivers a unified control system for ABP groups through particle-based simulation and spectral continuum modeling alongside model predictive control and deep learning forecasting. The N-particle Brownian dynamics simulations implement Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential to model excluded-volume interactions while incorporating thermal noise and angular velocity modulation with wavelength $\lambda$. The forced advection-diffusion equation describes the coarse-grained density evolution which the FTCS spectral space solver solves. A new MPC approach uses complex-valued density states to minimize immediate tracking errors against sinusoidal spatial setpoints with actuator limits and control penalties. The hybrid deep neural network combines Conv1D and LSTM and multi-head attention to learn future density profiles from simulated snapshot sequences.</p>

            <h2>Site Basis Excitation Ansatz for Matrix Product States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven R. White</p>
            <p>We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.</p>

            <p>Single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films (< 100 nm) form the backbone of magnonics, owing to the record-low losses affecting their magnetization dynamics. However, thin epitaxial YIG has mostly been investigated under ambient temperatures, limited by the paramagnetic losses occurring at low temperatures due to the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates required for epitaxial growth. Driven by a growing interest in magnonic devices that can operate in cryogenic conditions and address quantum information applications, there is a strong need for iron garnet epitaxial films grown on diamagnetic substrates that can maintain low losses at low temperatures. In this work, we use liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to grow ultrathin films of strained YIG on a commercial diamagnetic substrate, yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG). We investigate their magnetization dynamics in the 3-300 K temperature range, and compare them to equivalent films grown on paramagnetic GGG. We demonstrate for LPE YIG on YSGG substrates a ferromagnetic resonance linewidth below 1 mT at 3 K, together with a very weak temperature and frequency dependence of the losses. The growth of YIG/YSGG by LPE provides a straightforward approach to producing iron garnet thin films for use in low-temperature investigations.</p>

            <p>Recent development of cloud-based experiment platforms has allowed physicists to examine theoretical concepts with unprecedented convenience. Oqtant is a cloud-accessible platform for trapped Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) of neutral atomic gases, providing an invaluable experimental tool for studying the dynamics of BECs. Anomalous tunneling, which means low-energy phonon excitations of BECs easily transmit through a barrier potential, has been theoretically predicted as a characteristic phenomenon of BECs. We utilize Oqtant to observe the effects of anomalous tunneling on collective excitations of BECs. For this purpose, we theoretically show that anomalous tunneling affects the frequencies of the collective excitations in the low-energy region and experimentally measure their frequencies, finding that low-energy collective modes are less affected by a potential barrier, which indicates the presence of anomalous tunneling. Our work would contribute to fundamental understandings of BECs and stimulate further development and use of cloud-based experiments in this field.</p>

            <h2>Generalizing the composite fermion theory for fractional Chern insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Jin, Junren Shi</p>
            <p>We propose a generalized composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) by adapting the quantum mechanics approach of CFs. The theoretical framework naturally produces an effective CF Hamiltonian and a wavefunction ansatz, and the Bloch band characteristics of FCIs determine effective scalar and vector potentials experienced by CFs. Our analysis clarifies the construction of CF wavefunctions and state counting in CF phase space, which is subject to a density-of-states correction for filling factors $|\nu| \neq 1/2$. We apply the theory to study the $\nu=-2/3$ FCI state of the twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system, modeling it as either a $1/3$-filled electron band or a $2/3$-filled hole band. While both CF models exhibit trends and features consistent with exact diagonalization results, the electron-based model shows better agreement. Furthermore, we find that the FCI phase transition coincides with a topological phase transition in unoccupied CF $\Lambda$-bands.</p>

            <p>Magnetization, torque magnetometry, specific heat and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are used to study the high field intermediate phase between the 1/3-magnetization plateau and polarized state in the quantum Ising antiferromagnet Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triangular lattice. The magnetic phase diagram with the magnetic field up to 30 T is mapped by the comprehensive experimental data. The "up-up-down" (UUD) spin configuration of the 1/3-magnetization plateau state is identified by NMR spectral analysis. At higher magnetic fields, this UUD structure persist to the intermediate phase, which is finally destroyed in the polarized state. This observation supplies unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the absence of proposed high field spin supersolid phase. The high-field phase diagram of this quantum magnet proximate to the Ising-anisotropy limit contradicts with that proposed by theoretical studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zujian Dai, Xudong Zhu, Lixin He</p>
            <p>Despite sharing a common lattice structure, monolayer M$_2$X$_2$ compounds realize quantum anomalous Hall phases with distinct Chern numbers, a striking phenomenon that has not been fully exploared. Combining first-principles calculations with symmetry analysis and tight-binding models, we identify two generic band-inversion mechanisms governed by the orbital composition and symmetry representations of 3$d$ states near the Fermi level. When $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbtials dominate, a doubly degenerate $\Gamma$-point inversion yields $C=1$; otherwise, inversions occur along $\Gamma$-X and $\Gamma$-Y at four $C_4$-related momenta, whose Berry-curvature contributions add to give $C=2$, distinct from scenarios relying on multiple bands inversions at a single $\mathbf{k}$ point. The same mechanism consistently explains related two-dimensional systems, including LiFeSe, KTiSb, MgFeP, and Janus M$_2$X$_2$ derivatives. The mechanism provide practical guidance for screening and engineering tunable high-Chern-number insulators.</p>

            <p>We report the nonreciprocal charge transport along the longitudinal and transverse directions in the vortex flow regime of FeSe superconducting films. Clear nonreciprocal signals under an inplane magnetic field reveals symmetry breaking at the film surfaces since the crystal structure of FeSe is centrosymmetric. Although the symmetry in such polar superconductors allows the nonreciprocal transverse response under a magnetic field parallel to the electric current, its observation is physically counterintuitive because vortex motion is not expected in this configuration. We propose that thermally excited (anti)vortices due to the two-dimensional nature of FeSe give rise to the nonreciprocal transverse signals when the mirror symmetry is broken by the inplane magnetic field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avinash Kumar Jha, Shiladitya Sengupta</p>
            <p>Glasses are mechanically rigid, still undergo structural relaxation which changes their properties and affects potential technological applications. Understanding the underlying physical processes is a problem of broad theoretical and practical interest. We investigate intermittent structural relaxation events or ``avalanches'' occurring inside glassy regime. Contrary to the more well-known avalanches due to shear, here they are induced by thermal fluctuations in undeformed glass. By analyzing changes in structural, mechanical, dynamical, topological and vibrational properties of the system, we provide a multi-faceted characterization of avalanches. Overall we find that the system softens due to avalanches. Further, we develop a formalism to extract local measures of non-Affine displacement and tensorial strain for thermal amorphous solids in absence of any external deformation. Our analysis highlights a key difference between two types of driving: while the shear deformation response is dominated by volume preserving deviatoric strain, changes in local density must be considered to model response of undeformed glass under thermal noise. The observations suggest the idea of Generalized Strain Transformation Zones (GSTZ), where coupled shear and volume-changing deformations govern thermally-mediated plasticity. Our work paves the way for a unified description of elasto-plastic response of (athermal) mechanically deformed and thermally driven undeformed glasses.</p>

            <p>This study clarifies the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel. Hydrogen pre-charging (3.8 mass ppm diffusible hydrogen), followed by slow strain tensile testing (10-4 s-1), resulted in a brittle fracture at 900 MPa within the elastic regime. Fractographic studies indicated that surface crack initiation consists of intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology; site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. A mixed-mode morphology consisting of ductile and brittle features was observed adjacent to crack initiation. It differs from the previous investigation of uncharged DP steel, wherein a predominant brittle fracture was observed. Following significant crack growth, the pre-charged specimen exhibited predominant brittle fracture; site-specific TEM and transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies revealed {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Electron backscatter diffraction studies were performed on the cross-sectional cracks. We explain the HE via hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism. During loading, hydrogen diffuses to the prior austenite grain boundary, resulting in hydrogen-induced decohesion. Subsequent hydrogen diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity (>Vcrit). The high crack velocity effectively inhibits crack blunting via dislocation emission, ensuring sustained brittle crack growth even after hydrogen depletion at the crack tip, resulting in {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Based on TEM observations, we explain the formation of river pattern features on the {100} cleavage surface.</p>

            <p>Wurtzite-type nitrides have recently emerged as promising candidates for ferroelectric applications, yet their magnetic counterparts remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish MnSiN$_2$ and MnGeN$_2$ as aristotypes of a new multiferroic wurtzite family that simultaneously exhibits ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism. These Mn(II)-based nitrides crystallize in polar structures and display robust G-type antiferromagnetism at room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal that nonmagnetic analogs incorporating Zn and Mg possess high polarization reversal barriers (0.735 and 0.683 eV per formula unit) and wide band gaps (4.0 and 4.8 eV), making them ideal ferroelectric candidates. In contrast, MnSiN$_2$ and MnGeN$_2$ exhibit strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions (5--9 meV per Mn site) and moderate band gaps (1.6 and 1.0 eV), with reversal barriers of 0.963 and 0.460 eV per formula unit, respectively. Despite their limited magnetoelectric coupling, we show this family of Type-1 multiferroics exhibits altermagnetic spin splitting which reverses sign upon polarization switching. By strategically substituting alkaline-earth metals, we engineer multiple materials with coexisting switchable polarization, spin texture, and magnetic order. These findings open new avenues for the design of nitride-based altermagnetic multiferroics, offering a platform for integrated antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Platinum-water interfaces underpin many electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, despite decades of research, the real-space liquid structure of these interfaces remains elusive. Using three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM), we mapped Pt-water interface in real space with angstrom-level resolution. Topographic imaging revealed atomically flat (type I) and stripe-like (type II) surface nanodomains. Force-distance profiles above type I domains exhibited oscillatory decay patterns with periodicity of ~0.33 nm, consistent with water. In contrast, type II domains showed stronger oscillations with larger periodicity of ~0.45 nm and extended decay lengths, indicative of a different liquid structure with stronger correlation and ordering. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements of pure water and a series of liquid n-alkanes revealed peaks at ~0.31 nm and ~0.46 nm, in agreement with 3D-AFM observations of type I and type II structures, respectively. Our findings uncover the coexistence of two types of liquid structures at Pt-water interfaces modulated by surface heterogeneity, enabling new understandings and design principles for energy conversion applications.</p>

            <p>The boson peak is a characteristic anomaly of amorphous solids broadly defined as a low-energy excess in the density of states and heat capacity compared to the textbook predictions of Debye theory. The origin of this anomaly has long been the subject of ongoing debate and remains a topic of active controversy. While remaining agnostic about the microscopic origin of the phenomenon, we propose that the boson peak (BP) may universally originate from a dispersionless, optic-like excitation, which we refer to as the 'flat mode'. We revisit both experimental and simulation data from the literature through this lens and conduct further simulations in 2D and 3D amorphous systems. These analyses collectively provide supporting evidence for this interpretation. Notably, if this is indeed the case, a striking analogy emerges with similar anomalies observed in crystalline materials, where the nonphononic flat mode is effectively replaced by anomalously low-energy optical phonons.</p>

We illustrate a cascade of topological phase transitions controllable by BCL and demonstrate how these transitions are reflected in the anomalous Hall response of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we show that the spin-textures and Fermi surfaces can be directly tuned by the relative phase of the BCL, stemming from the underlying symmetry changes. Our findings can pave the way for effectively controlling altermagnetic materials with structured light.</p>

            <p>Recently, the driven dynamics of localization phase transitions have garnered growing interest. However, studies so far have mainly considered initial localized states, whose driven dynamics follow the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization phase transition in the Aubry-André (AA) model starting from a gapless extended state, which violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of KZM. By linearly driving the quasiperiodic potential strength across the critical point, we numerically simulate the driven dynamics and analyze the scaling behavior of both the inverse participation ratio ($\mathcal{I}$) and the dynamic deviation from the instantaneous ground state energy $(\mathcal{D})$. We demonstrate that the driven dynamics starting from initially extended states satisfies the criterion for the applicability of KZM and its extension, finite-time scaling (FTS). The scaling functions governing the driven dynamics of both $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ have been derived based on FTS and numerically validated. We found that the scaling functions exhibit significant differences at large $R$ and small $R$, and also differ considerably from the scaling functions when the initial state is localized, highlighting the crucial role of initial state behavior. The established scaling laws remain robust across a wide range of system sizes and driving rates, providing testable predictions for experimental realizations.</p>

            <p>In the present work we introduce and explore a technique for the efficient removal of vortices from an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, through the application and subsequent removal of a one-dimensional optical lattice. We showcase a prototypical experimental realization of the technique that motivates a detailed theoretical study of vortex removal mechanisms. Through simulations of the condensate dynamics during application of the optical lattice, we also discover a vortex removal mechanism that arises in narrow, optical-lattice-induced atomic density channels for which the channel width is on the order of the nominal vortex core size and healing length. This mechanism involves the density profile typically associated with a vortex core spatially separating from the phase singularity associated with the vortex. By analyzing numerical experiments covering a wide range of variations of the optical lattice amplitude and fringe periodicity, we identify the existence of an optimal set of parameters that enables the efficient removal of all vortices from the condensate. This analysis paves the way for further studies aimed at understanding vortex dynamics in narrow channels, and adds to an experimental toolkit for working with vortices and controlling the dynamical states of condensates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Gosselin (IF), Aïleen Lotz</p>
            <p>In a series of papers, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a microeconomic framework of investors and firms. Financial agents could invest in both firms and other investors, while banks, introduced as investors with a credit multiplier, played a stabilizing or destabilizing role. Two types of interactions were considered within the financial sector: financial agents could either lend capital to or buy shares of other investors. We examined the collective states emerging from these interactions. At the macro level, we identified multiple collective states, each characterized by distinct levels of average capital and investor distribution across sectors. These states reflect the inherent instability of financial markets, with some configurations leading to default. At the micro level, we analyzed how returns and defaults propagate within a given collective state, highlighting the critical role of banks in stabilizing or amplifying financial fluctuations. However, these results were derived under the assumption that financial connections were exogenous. The present paper removes this assumption by modeling financial connections as dynamic endogenous variables. Specifically, we extend the framework by introducing a field representation of the network of financial relationships. The collective states previously identified are now embedded in a broader class of states, characterized by the structure of investment shares among investors. We show that these collective states consist of interconnected groups of agents, along with their returns and disposable capital. Depending on the strength and form of connections between agents within each group, collective states may be stable or unstable, allowing for transitions between configurations. In each collective state, some sectors may experience defaults. When the collective state exhibits specific structural conditions, defaults may spread across a significant share of the group.</p>

            <h2>An Approach to the Quantum Hall Effect in Three- Dimensional Electron Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. A. Hidalgo</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical framework to describe the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems. This extends our previous single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to two-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene, where insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional sequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization, we generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and high mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE. For 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an effective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large effective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the calculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical expressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall conductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical predictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states. Simulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations under realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D semimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron Landau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This provides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions, highlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility. The model further suggests new avenues for analyzing thermodynamic and transport properties in 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions.</p>

            <p>Ensuring the stability of the AuNP-gene complex until it reaches the target sites is a crucial factor for the success of gene therapy. Though different AuNP sizes and AuNP-to-DNA ratios are investigated for specific therapeutic needs, their role on the stability and packaging of AuNP-DNA complex remains unclear. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of cationic ligand-functionalized AuNP (CAuNP) size and CAuNP-to-DNA ratio on DNA wrapping and binding affinity. The obtained results show that single DNA interacting with smaller CAuNPs exhibit greater bending and wrapping due to their higher curvature. However, when two DNAs bind to smaller CAuNPs, electrostatic repulsion prevents the effective wrapping which leads the DNAs to twist from their original orientation. Such behaviour is not observed with larger CAuNPs since their increased size may mitigates repulsive forces. Further, the analysis on axial bending angle reveals that smaller AuNPs induce sharper DNA bending and larger AuNPs promote smoother bending. In addition, the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) analysis confirms a stronger DNA binding affinity for larger AuNPs with affinity decreasing when two DNAs attach to a single CAuNP. Our results from the DNA loading capacity calculations provide insights into the maximum number of DNA molecules that can be loaded onto CAuNPs of a given size. These findings offer key insights into optimizing the size of AuNP and DNA-to-AuNP ratios for the development of efficient gene delivery systems.</p>

            <p>Real band topology often appears in systems with space-time inversion symmetry and is characterized by invariants such as the Euler and second Stiefel-Whitney classes. Here, we examine the generic band topology of Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, where $C_{2z}$ and $T$ are twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. We discuss the Euler band topology of superfluids and superconductors in the DIII and CI Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, where the Euler class serves as an integer-valued topological invariant of the $4\times4$ BdG Hamiltonian. Using expressions for the Euler class under $n$-fold rotational symmetry, we derive formulas relating the Euler class to previously known topological invariants of class DIII and CI systems. We demonstrate that three-dimensional class DIII topological phases with an odd winding number, including the B phase of superfluid Helium 3, are topological superconductors or superfluids with a nontrivial Euler class. We refer to these as Euler superconductors or superfluids. Specifically, the $^3$He-B superfluid in a magnetic field is identified as an Euler superfluid. Three-dimensional class CI topological phases with twice an odd winding number are also Euler superconductors or superfluids. When spatial inversion symmetry is present, class CI superconductors with a nontrivial Euler class exhibit superconducting nodal lines with a linking structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated using a model of a three-dimensional $s_\pm$-wave superconductor. These findings provide a unified framework for exploring Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors, connecting various phenomena associated with $T$-breaking perturbations, including Majorana Ising susceptibility and higher-order topology.</p>

            <h2>Quasidegenerate charge-density wave states in 1T-TiSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungrok Mun, Woojin Choi, Hayoon Im, Sung-Kwan Mo, Choongyu Hwang, Jinwoong Hwang, Heung-Sik Kim</p>
            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenides have been actively studied for their intriguing charge density wave (CDW) formations and their impacts on material properties. Among these, 1T-TiSe$_2$ is well-known to exhibit a 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW state transition at 200 K, but its true ground state nature remains under debate. In this study, we investigate possible CDW states in 1T-TiSe$_2$ and their consequences for transport properties by employing first-principles electronic structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We identify seven distinct types of 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phases, most of which have not been reported previously. All of these phases are nearly degenerate in energy with each other ($< 1.41$ meV per formula unit). Using the band unfolding technique, we compare the electronic band structures of these CDW phases with experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data. Our findings support the presence of a possible second phase transition at 165 K and suggest a new intermediate CDW order between 165 and 200 K that was previously unexplored. This result provides a possible resolution to the conflict between previous reports on the ground state symmetry of 1T-TiSe$_2$, and opens a viable route to phase engineering of 1T-TiSe$_2$ for functional applications.</p>

            <h2>Duality between dissipation-coherence trade-off and thermodynamic speed limit based on thermodynamic uncertainty relation for stochastic limit cycles in the weak-noise limit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuna Nagayama, Sosuke Ito</p>
            <p>We derive two fundamental trade-offs for general stochastic limit cycles in the weak-noise limit. The first is the dissipation-coherence trade-off, which was numerically conjectured and partially proved by Santolin and Falasco [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 057101 (2025)]. This trade-off bounds the entropy production required for one oscillatory period using the number of oscillations that occur before steady-state correlations are disrupted. The second is the thermodynamic speed limit, which bounds the entropy production with the Euclidean length of the limit cycle. These trade-offs are obtained by substituting mutually dual observables, derived from the stability of the limit cycle, into the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. This fact allows us to regard the dissipation-coherence trade-off as the dual of the thermodynamic speed limit. We numerically demonstrate these trade-offs using the noisy Rössler model.</p>

We apply our new method to superionic-state semiconductors of p-type Cu2Se and n-type Ag2S. The experimental data differentiate the two types of enhancements during the phase transition: a colossal SE (Scolossal), exhibiting an enormous value of up to 5 mV/K, and a slight enhancement in SE (Sstructure), approximately 1.5-2.0 times larger than those in the absence of the phase transition. We provide critical insights that both enhancements in SE arising during the structural phase transition are not intrinsic phenomena.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a large variety of electronic properties depending on chemical composition, number of layers and stacking-order. Among them, alpha-In2Se3 has attracted much attention due to the promise of outstanding electronic properties, attractive quantum physics, in- and out-of-plane ferroelectricity and high photo-response. Precise experimental determination of the electronic structure of rhombohedral (3R) alpha-In2Se3 is needed for a better understanding of potential properties and device applications. Here, combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that 3R alpha-In2Se3 phase exhibits a robust inversion of the valence band parabolicity at the Gamma point forming a bow-shaped dispersion with a depth of 140 +- 10 meV between the valence band maximum (VBM) along the GammaK direction of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Moreover, we unveil an indirect band gap of about 1.25 eV, as well as a highly electron doping of approximatively 5.1012 electrons per cmsquare at the surface. This leads to surface band bending and the formation of a prominent electron accumulation layer. These findings allow a deeper understanding of the rhombohedral alpha-In2Se3 electronic properties underlying the potential of III/VI semiconductors for electronic and photonic technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wu-Rong Jian, Yifan Wang, Wei Cai</p>
            <p>Dislocation jogs have strong effects on dislocation motion that governs the strain-hardening behavior of crystalline solids, but how to properly account for their effect in mesoscale models remains poorly understood. We develop a mobility model for jogged edge dislocations in FCC nickel, based on systematic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations across a range of jog configurations, stresses, and temperatures. At low stresses, jogged edge dislocations exhibit non-linear, thermally activated dragging and a higher Peierls barrier compared to straight dislocations. Surprisingly, stress-velocity curves for a given jog configuration across varying temperatures intersect at an invariant point ($\tau_{\rm c}$, $v_{\rm c}$), where $\tau_{\rm c}$ delineates thermally-activated and phonon-drag regimes and is close to the Peierls stress ($\tau_{\rm p}$). Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple three-section expression for jogged dislocation mobility, featuring minimal and physically interpretable parameters. This mobility law offers a realistic description of jog effects for dislocation dynamics (DD) simulations, improving their physical fidelity for crystal plasticity predictions.</p>

            <p>Martensitic transformations drive a multitude of emerging applications, which range from high stroke actuation and, mechanocaloric refrigeration, to thermoelastic energy harvesting. All these applications benefit from faster transformations, as a high cycle frequency is essential for achieving high power density. However, systematic investigations of the fast dynamics and fundamental speed limits of martensitic transformations are scarce. Especially for ultrashort time transformations, the temperature evolution throughout the transformation is not measured, which is a substantial shortcoming as temperature is the intrinsic force driving the transformation. Here, we present a synchrotron-based time-resolved X-ray diffraction study of a 270 fs laser-induced martensitic transformation in a Ni-Mn-Ga-based epitaxial thin film. We observe the transformation from martensite to austenite within about 100 ps, just limited by the synchrotron probe pulse duration. Furthermore, a full transformation cycle from martensite to austenite and back to martensite can almost be finished within 5 ns, which is the fastest martensitic transformation reported so far. Measurements and calculations of the temperature evolution allow us to analyse the influence of temperature on transformation time. By time-resolved strain measurements we demonstrate that in addition to temperature, thermal film stress must be considered as a competing influence on the martensitic transformation. Our experimental findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations with machine learned force fields adapted to density functional theory calculations. These reveal that the huge distortion during a martensitic transformation requires the collective movement of many atoms within the microstructure, which delays the transformation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chloe C Newsom, Lillian B Hughes, Ben L Green, Ania C Bleszynski Jayich, Mark E Newton</p>
            <p>Electron irradiation and annealing treatments are a method of colour centre/defect creation in diamond. The depth profile of defects created by low energy 200 keV electrons in single crystal high purity (type II) electronic grade diamond grown via chemical vapour deposition has been investigated. The depth profile of monovacancies created was found, using photoluminescence (PL), to decay exponentially, with decay length $12\pm1$ $\mu$m and production rate of $(1.1\pm0.2)\times 10 ^{-1}$ V/e$^{-}$/cm at the surface. The depth distribution of the neutral and negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^{0/-}$) centre, and the 733 nm zero phonon line defect formed during an isochronal annealing study have also been investigated by PL. The observed NV profiles, which do not match the vacancy profiles, can be qualitatively explained in terms of a simple model that includes the formation of vacancy clusters and the nitrogen-divacancy (NV$_{2}$) defect. The production of (NV$^{0/-}$) has been assumed to be nitrogen limited, but this paper has shown that this is not the case, with NVs lost to the production of NV$_{2}$ when the concentration of vacancies greatly exceeds that of substitutional nitrogen.</p>

            <p>The high computational cost of ab-initio methods limits their application in predicting electronic properties at the device scale. Therefore, an efficient method is needed to map the atomic structure to the electronic structure quickly. Here, we develop GPUTB, a GPU-accelerated tight-binding (TB) machine learning framework. GPUTB employs atomic environment descriptors, enabling the model parameters to incorporate environmental dependence. This allows the model to transfer to different basis, xc-functionals, and allotropes easily. Combined with the linear scaling quantum transport method, we have calculated the electronic density of states for up to 100 million atoms in pristine graphene. Trained on finite-temperature structures, the model can be easily extended to millions of atom finite-temperature systems. Furthermore, GPUTB can also successfully describe h-BN/graphene heterojunction systems, demonstrating its capability to handle complex material with high precision. We accurately reproduce the relationship between carrier concentration and room temperature mobility in graphene to verify the framework's accuracy. Therefore, our GPUTB framework presents a delicate balance between computational accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful computational tool for investing electronic properties for large systems with millions of atoms.</p>

            <h2>Mechanisms of Chain Exchange in Diblock Copolymer Micelles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Varner, Marcus Müller, Alejandro Gallegos, Timothy P. Lodge, Kevin D. Dorfman, Zhen-Gang Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate the mechanism of chain exchange in diblock copolymer micelles using two distinct yet complementary simulation techniques. First, enhanced sampling method is combined with coarse-grained molecular dynamics to compute a two-dimensional free energy surface for the chain expulsion process in the strong segregation regime. To facilitate chain expulsion, a distance-based collective variable is biased, and the end-to-end distance of the core block is also biased to ensure sufficient sampling of chain conformations. The free energy surface reveals a bimodal distribution of chain conformations along the effective reaction coordinate. The minimum free energy pathway qualitatively aligns with the Halperin-Alexander budding-like mechanism. The free energy barrier along this pathway is calculated for core block lengths ranging from $N_\textrm{core}=4$-$100$, and the barrier is shown to scale as $\beta\Delta F_\textrm{barr} \sim N_\textrm{core}^{2/3}$, consistent with the Halperin-Alexander prediction for a globular transition state. Notably, the free energy surface also reveals a nearly degenerate alternative pathway in which the chain escapes by extending out bead-by-bead, in agreement with previous simulations. We also study the case of a dense copolymer melt, where the core-block shrinks but does not collapse into a dry compact globule in the opposite phase. To examine the kinetic pathway, a simplified model is introduced in which a single chain escapes from a planar interface within a mean-field background. Forward flux sampling calculations yield a linear scaling of the barrier, $\beta\Delta F_\textrm{barr} \sim N_\textrm{core}$, in agreement with experimental observations and prior simulations. Moreover, analysis of successful escape trajectories highlights an extended chain conformation at the transition state.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal magnons, characterized by propagation with differing energies along the k and -k directions, are crucial for modern spintronics applications. However, their realization in van der Waals layered antiferromagnets remains elusive. In this letter, we report robust nonreciprocal magnon behavior in layered honeycomb antiferromagnets VPX3(X =S,Se,Te). Our results demonstrate that, in addition to their intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the nonreciprocity of magnons is strongly influenced by the layer number, interlayer coupling, and magnon-magnon interactions. More importantly, in such layered antiferromagnets, the magnon nonreciprocity exhibits an asymmetric periodic dependence on the Neel vector, offering a novel route for experimentally probing antiferromagnetic order parameters in the 2D limit.</p>

            <p>The optical properties of atomically thin semiconductors are dominated by excitons, tightly bound electron-hole pairs, which give rise to particularly rich and remarkable physics. Despite their importance, the microscopic formation mechanisms of excitons remain very poorly understood due to the complex interplay of concurrent phenomena occurring on an ultrafast timescale. Here, we investigate the exciton formation processes in 2D materials based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers using a technique based on the control of excitation light polarization. It allows us to distinguish between the two competing models of exciton formation: geminate and bimolecular formation. The geminate process is the direct formation of the exciton from the initially photogenerated electron hole pair before the loss of correlation between them, whereas the bimolecular process corresponds to the random binding of free electron hole-pairs from the initially photogenerated plasma. These processes control the exciton formation time. Our findings reveal that the luminescence intensity is higher by up to 40% for circularly polarized excitation compared to linearly polarized excitation for laser energy above the free carrier gap. We show that this spin-dependent exciton emission is a fingerprint of the bimolecular formation process. Importantly, we observe that exciton linear polarization (valley coherence) persists even for laser excitation energies exceeding the gap. We demonstrate that it is the result of a fraction of excitons formed by a geminate process. This shows that two formation processes coexist for excitation energies above the gap, where both mechanisms operate concurrently.</p>

            <p>Hybrid structures incorpora1ng both III-nitride and Transi1on Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors have strong applica1on poten1al for light harves1ng and optoelectronics. Here we have inves1gated the proper1es of hybrid structures based on a MoSe2 monolayer coupled to an InGaN quantum well (QW). The coupling efficiency is controlled by a thin GaN barrier of variable thickness located between them. Time-integrated and 1me-resolved micro-photoluminescence experiments show a quenching of the InGaN QW exciton emission which increases with the decrease of the GaN barrier thickness d: the PL intensity is reduced by a factor 3 for d=1 nm as a consequence of carrier transfer to the MoSe2 monolayer. This interplay between the two semiconductors is confirmed by 1meresolved photoluminescence spectroscopy highligh1ng a clear reduc1on of the QW exciton life1me in the presence of the monolayer. Interes1ngly the coupling between the QW and the TMD monolayer is also demonstrated by measuring op1cally the excitonic transport proper1es in the quantum well: the exciton diffusion length decreases in the presence of the MoSe2 monolayer. The measured dependences as a func1on of temperature highlight the role played by localiza1on effects in the QW. All these results can be well interpreted by a type II band alignment between the InGaN QW and the MoSe2 monolayer and a tunneling process between the two semiconductors.</p>

            <p>Realizing room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, critical enablers for low-power spintronics, is fundamentally challenged by the long-standing trade-off between ferromagnetic ordering and indirect exchange interactions in insulators. Ionic evolution offers tempting opportunities for accessing exotic magnetoelectric states and physical functionality beyond conventional doping paradigm via tailoring the charge-lattice-orbital-spin interactions. Here, we showcase the precise magneto-ionic control over magnetoelectric states in LSMO system, delicately delivering silicon-compatible weakly ferromagnetic insulator state above room temperature. Of particular note is the decoupling of ion-charge-spin interplay in correlated LSMO system, a primary obstacle in clarifying underlying physical origin, with this process concurrently giving rise to an emergent intermediate state characterized by a weakly ferromagnetic half-metallic state. Benefiting from the SrTiO3 buffer layer as epitaxial template to promote interfacial heterogeneous nucleation, hydrogenation enables diverse magnetoelectric states in LSMO integrated on silicon, fully compatible with traditional semiconductor processing. Assisted by theoretical calculations and spectroscopic techniques, hydrogen-induced magnetoelectric transitions in LSMO are driven by band-filling control and suppression in double exchange interaction. Our work not only defines a novel design paradigm for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated system, with transformative potential for spintronics, but also fundamentally unveils the physical origin behind ionic evolution via disentangling the ion-charge-spin coupling.</p>

            <p>Capturing the dynamics of active particles, i.e., small self-propelled agents that both deform and are deformed by a fluid in which they move is a formidable problem as it requires coupling fine scale hydrodynamics with large scale collective effects. So we present a multi-scale framework that combines the three learning-driven tools to learn in concert within one pipeline. We use high-resolution Lattice Boltzmann snapshots of fluid velocity and particle stresses in a periodic box as input to the learning pipeline. the second step takes the morphology and positions orientations of particles to predict pairwise interaction forces between them with a E(2)-equivariant graph neural network that necessarily respect flat symmetries. Then, a physics-informed neural network further updates these local estimates by summing over them with a stress data using Fourier feature mappings and residual blocks that is additionally regularized with a topological term (introduced by persistent homology) to penalize unrealistically tangled or spurious connections. In concert, these stages deliver an holistic highly-data driven full force network prediction empathizing on the physical underpinnings together with emerging multi-scale structure typical for active matter.</p>

            <p>Indium selenide attracts the interest due to its outstanding electronic and optical properties which are potentially prospective in view of applications in electronic and photonic devices. Most of the polymorphic crystal phases of this semiconductor belong to the family of two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors. In this study optically active indium selenide crystal phase heterostructures are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy in a well-controlled manner. It is demonstrated that by changing the growth conditions one may obtain either {\gamma}-InSe, or {\gamma}-In2Se3, or \b{eta}-yIn2Se3 crystal phases. The most promising crystal phase heterostructures from the point of view of photonic applications is found to be the {\gamma}-InSe/{\gamma}-In2Se3 heterostructure. An intense optical emission from this heterostructure appears in the near infrared spectral range. The emission energy can be tuned over 250 meV by changing {\gamma}-InSe layer thickness which is explained by the quantum size effect. The optically active indium selenide crystal phase heterostructures represent, therefore, an interesting platform for the design of light sources and detectors in the near infra-red. The use of molecular beam epitaxy for this purpose ensures that the structures are fabricated on large surfaces opening the possibility for the design of device prototypes by using lithography methods</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriele de Mauro, Marco Biroli, Satya N. Majumdar, Gregory Schehr</p>
            <p>We consider a one-dimensional gas of $N$ independent Brownian particles subject to simultaneous stochastic resetting, with inter-reset times drawn from a general waiting-time distribution $\psi(\tau)$. This includes the well-known Poissonian case, where $\psi(\tau)=re^{-r\tau}$, and extends to more general classes of resetting, such as heavy-tailed and bounded distributions. We show that the simultaneous resetting generates correlations between particles dynamically. These correlations grow with time and eventually drive the system into a strongly correlated non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). Exploiting the renewal structure of the resetting dynamics, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in the NESS. We show that the NESS has a conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that enables us to compute various physical observables exactly for arbitrary $\psi(\tau)$. These observables include the average density, extreme value and order statistics, the spacing distribution between consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a given interval centered at the origin. We discuss the universal features of the large $N$ scaling behaviors of these observables for different choices of the resetting protocol $\psi(\tau)$. Our results provide an interesting example of a stochastic control whereby, by tuning the inter-reset distribution $\psi(\tau)$, one can generate a class of tunable, and yet solvable, strongly correlated NESS in a many-body system.</p>

Polarization analysis and incident-photon energy detuning measurements confirm the persistence of collective paramagnon excitations up to $x = 0.50$. Consistent with previous studies on other cuprate families, we observe a pronounced crossover near $x = 0.15$, where paramagnon spectral weight is transferred to incoherent spin-flip excitations associated with the particle-hole continuum. The overall behavior of paramagnons in LCCO resembles that in other hole-doped cuprates and appears insensitive to the persistence of superconductivity at high doping levels in LCCO - up to at least $x = 0.50$, as demonstrated in prior work. These findings support the view that high-energy magnetic excitations probed by RIXS are not a major contributor to superconducting pairing, in line with theories of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity.</p>

We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing.

            <h2>Towards Accurate and Scalable High-throughput MOF Adsorption Screening: Merging Classical Force Fields and Universal Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satyanarayana Bonakala, Mohammad Wahiduzzaman, Taku Watanabe, Karim Hamzaoui, Guillaume Maurin</p>
            <p>High-throughput computational screening (HTCS) of gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) typically relies on classical generic force fields such as the Universal Force Field (UFF), which are efficient but often fail to capture complex host-guest interactions. Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (u-MLIPs) offer near-quantum accuracy at far lower cost than density functional theory (DFT), yet their large-scale application in adsorption screening remains limited. Here, we present a hybrid screening strategy that merges Widom insertion Monte Carlo simulations performed with both UFF and the PreFerred Potential (PFP) u-MLIP to evaluate the adsorption performance of a large MOF database, using ethylene capture under humid conditions as a benchmark. From a curated set of MOFs, 88 promising candidates initially identified using UFF-based HTCS were re-evaluated with the PFP u-MLIP, benchmarked against DFT calculations to refine adsorption predictions and assess the role of framework flexibility. We show that PFP u-MLIP is essential to accurately assess the sorption performance of MOFs involving strong hydrogen bonding or confinement pockets within narrow pores, effects poorly captured using UFF. Notably, accounting for framework flexibility through full unit cell relaxation revealed deviations in ethylene affinity of up to 20 kJ mol-1, underscoring the impact of guest-induced structural changes. This HTCS workflow identified seven MOFs with optimal pore sizes, high ethylene affinity, and high C2H4/H2O selectivity, offering moisture-tolerant performance for applications from food packaging to trace ethylene removal. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately capturing host-guest energetics and framework flexibility, and demonstrate the practicality of incorporating u-MLIPs into scalable HTCS for identifying top MOF sorbents.</p>

            <h2>Confinement, deconfinement, and bound states in the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ generalizations of the Majumdar--Ghosh chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aman Sharma, Mithilesh Nayak, Natalia Chepiga, Henrik M. Rønnow, Frédéric Mila</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of low-energy excitations in a spin chain with antiferrmomagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and three-site $J_3$ interactions using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group and the single mode approximation techniques. In the absence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the spectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized line for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$ chain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon modes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ chains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we disentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After including the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution of the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the Haldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation spectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the order of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the line of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined, and the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from the transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across the phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases, revealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase transitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding to the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle framework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across distinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains.</p>

            <p>We conducted x-ray absorption (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Co $L_{2,3}$ edges on single crystals of the Kitaev candidate honeycomb lattice compound BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. The measurements employed the inverse partial fluorescence yield technique, which is ideal for acquiring reliable x-ray absorption spectra from highly insulating samples, enabling precise quantitative analysis. Our experimental results revealed a significant linear dichroic signal, indicating strong trigonal distortion in the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. We performed a detailed analysis of the experimental XAS and XMCD spectra using a full-multiplet configuration-interaction cluster model. This analysis unveiled that the $t_{2g}$ hole density is predominantly localized in the $a_{1g}$ orbital. Through XMCD sum rules and theoretical calculations, we quantified both the spin and orbital magnetic moments. Our study demonstrates that the local electronic structure of the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra displays an effective trigonal distortion of approximately $-0.114$ eV. This distortion is larger than the Co $3d$ spin-orbit coupling constant, emphasizing the crucial impact of local structural distortions on the electronic and magnetic properties of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.</p>

            <p>The honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ has been a leading candidate for realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL), but its intrinsic spin dynamics have remained obscured by crystal twinning. Here we apply biaxial anisotropic strain to detwin $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ single crystals and directly visualize the intrinsic magnetic excitations using inelastic neutron scattering. We discover that the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the magnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes stringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined, quantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state and its low-energy dynamics. Above the magnon band, we uncover broad excitation continua: while a twofold-symmetric feature near 6 meV at $\Gamma$ is consistent with bimagnon scattering, the dominant spectral weight forms a sixfold-symmetric continuum extending up to $\sim 16$ meV that cannot be explained by conventional magnons. This strongly supports the presence of fractionalized excitations-a hallmark of Kitaev QSL physics. Our findings establish biaxial strain as a powerful symmetry-breaking probe to access the intrinsic spin dynamics of Kitaev materials and provide critical benchmarks for refining theoretical models of quantum magnetism in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$.</p>

            <p>The system of mixed hexagonal and square lattices on a spherical surface is examined, with an emphasis on the exploration of the disclination patterns that form in the square-rich regime. To demonstrate the possible outcomes, the Hertzian potential energy is used as a model for pairwise molecular interactions, which is known to support coexistent hexagonal and square lattices. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we show that at least four different disclination morphologies arise in a square-rich background: triangular defect domains composed of hexagonal lattices arranged in a cubic formation, bridged cubic state, linear scar disclinations with no hexagon content, and open scar disclinations containing a significant amount of hexagonal lattice in the open regions. Order parameters are also introduced to highlight the significance of the bridged and open-scar disclinations, both being the new morphologies reported in this study. The fact that the bridged state is an energetically preferred one is further demonstrated by a separate elastic energy model, which confirms its prevalence over the unbridged cubic state.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetic Proximity Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziye Zhu, Richang Huang, Xianzhang Chen, Xunkai Duan, Jiayong Zhang, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou</p>
            <p>Proximity effects not only complement the conventional methods of designing materials, but also enable realizing properties that are not present in any constituent region of the considered heterostructure. Here we reveal an unexplored altermagnetic proximity effect (AMPE), distinct from its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic counterparts. Using first-principles and model analyses of van der Waals heterostructures based on the prototypical altermagnet V$_2$Se$_2$O, we show that its hallmark momentum-alternating spin splitting can be directly imprinted onto adjacent nonmagnetic layers -- a process we term altermagnetization. This is demonstrated in a monolayer PbO through characteristic band splitting and real-space spin densities, with systematic dependence on interlayer spacing and magnetic configuration. We further predict broader AMPE manifestations: Valley-selective spin splitting in a monolayer PbS and a topological superconducting phase in monolayer NbSe$_2$, both inheriting the alternating $k$-space spin texture of the altermagnet. These results establish AMPE not only as a distinct proximity mechanism, but also as a powerful method of using altermagnetism in designing emergent phenomena and versatile applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamad Usman, Tarun Kanti Ghosh, SK Firoz Islam</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical study of spin Hall phenomena in a nanoribbon made of a two-dimensional square lattice with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. We show that the nanoribbon can give rise to a number of additional spin degeneracy points as well as anti-crossing points, apart from the $\Gamma$ point, between two nearest sub-bands. We compute the spin Hall conductivity and demonstrate that it diverges and gives rise to a resonance when chemical potential passes through those spin-degenerate or anti-crossing points. Contrary to the previous studies, here such resonance emerges even without any external perturbation like magnetic field or light. In addition, we examine the influence of anisotropy in Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, as well as finite-temperature effects, and show that the inter subband resonance remains robust. Finally, we also investigate the signature of such additional spin degeneracy and anti-crossing points in the longitudinal conductance by using retarded Green function approach in lattice model. The peculiar features of the bands are reflected in the longitudinal conductance, which takes quantized values of $2n e^{2}/{h},$ where $n$ denotes the number of bands occupied by the chemical potential with each band having spin split sub-bands.</p>

            <h2>Oxygen-driven altermagnetic symmetry inducing d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates and nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tom G. Saunderson, James F. Annett, Samir Lounis</p>
            <p>Since the discovery of cuprate high-Tc superconductivity, numerous theoretical frameworks have been proposed; Anderson's RVB picture (Science 235, 1196-1198, 1987) and U(1) gauge theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 503-506, 1996) motivate a minimal one-band view that largely integrates out oxygen. By contrast, altermagnetism (Phys. Rev. X 12, 040501, 2022) yields a d-wave-like k-space magnetic texture from alternatingly rotated nonmagnetic cages; La2CuO4 (the parent of a high-Tc cuprate) is a prototypical example. As a proof of principle, we show in La2CuO4 that an alternating local pairing potential on the two Cu sublattices (plus/minus s(r)) produces a nodal, d-wave-like Delta(k). Since orthorhombic tilts are not the driver (and even suppress superconductivity in nickelates; Nature 621, 493, 2023), we then show that the in-plane oxygen sublattice of CuO2/NiO2 layers - ubiquitous in cuprates and nickelates - intrinsically realizes the same symmetry. Imposing an oxygen-centered, staggered s pairing yields a d-wave gap with perfect C4 symmetry, demonstrated self-consistently in NdNiO2 from first principles. While the microscopic origin remains open, we outline possible scenarios, and our real-space construction maps directly onto lattice models, placing superconductivity and Hubbard physics on the same footing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anita Halder, Declan Nell, Akash Bajaj, Stefano Sanvito, Andrea Droghetti</p>
            <p>We present a systematic first-principles investigation of linear-response spin-dependent quantum transport in the van der Waals ferromagnets Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$, and Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. Using density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compute their Fermi surfaces, transmission coefficients, and orbital-projected density of states. All compounds exhibit nearly half-metallic conductance along the out-of-plane direction. This is characterized by a finite transmission coefficient for one spin channel and a gap in the other, resulting in spin polarization values exceeding 90$\%$ in the bulk. Notably, Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ displays the ideal half-metallic behavior, with the Fermi energy located deep in the spin-down transmission gap. We further show that this high spin polarization is preserved in bilayer magnetic tunnel junctions, which exhibit a large tunnel magnetoresistance of the order of several hundred percent. This findings underscore the promise of these materials, and in particular of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, for spintronics applications.</p>

            <h2>Strongly tilted field induced fractional quantized-drift in non-interacting system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Zhu, Zhi Tan, Huilin Gong, Honghua Zhong, Xin-You Lü, Xiaoguang Wang</p>
            <p>Fractional quantized response appears to be a distinctive characteristic in interacting topological systems. Here, we discover a novel phenomenon of tilt-induced fractional quantize drift in non-interacting system constructed by a time-modulated superlattice subjected to a external time-independent gradient potential. Depending on the tilt strength, Rabi oscillations between adjacent lowest enegy bands caused by Landau-Zener tunneling, can induce that the one-cycle-averaged drift displacement is fraction, which is relate to the ratio of the sum of Chern numbers of multiple bands to the number of energy bands involved in Landau Zener tunneling. As representative examples, we construct fractional (1/3, 1/2) quantize drift only via adjusting period of lattice. The numerical simulations allow us to consider a realistic setup amenable of an experimental realization. Our findings will expand the research implications of both fractional quantize response and topological materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantin S. Kolegov, Viktor M. Fliagin, Natalia A. Ivanova</p>
            <p>Evaporative lithography in cells of arbitrary configuration allows for the creation of diverse particle deposition patterns due to the formation of a specific flow structure in the liquid caused by non-uniform evaporation. The latter in turn is determined by the shape of the liquid layer surface and the wetting menisci on the cell walls. Thus, predicting the shape of the wetting menisci can serve as a tool for controlling the process of creating desired particle deposition patterns and evaporation dynamics. Here, we propose a simple and sufficiently accurate methodology for determining the shape of the liquid meniscus in cells of arbitrary geometric shape, based on a combination of mathematical modeling and a series of experimental measurement techniques. The surface profiles of the liquid meniscus in cylindrical, square, and triangular cells were determined by measuring the change in the reflection angle of a laser beam from the free liquid surface while scanning from the cell wall to its center. The height of the wetting meniscus on the inner cell wall and the minimum liquid layer thickness at the center of the cell were measured by analyzing optical images and using a contact method, respectively. 3D meniscus profiles were obtained by numerically solving the Helmholtz equation. The boundary conditions and the unknown constant in the equation were determined based on experimental data obtained for several local points or cross-sections. A comparison of the simulated meniscus shapes and experimentally obtained local values showed satisfactory agreement, with an error of less than 14%.</p>

            <h2>Unified Description for Reentrance and Tc Enhancement in Ferromagnetic Superconductors</h2>

            <p>Ferromagnetic superconductors, where ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist despite their antagonism, exhibit strikingly diverse behaviors. Depending on the interplay between the ferromagnetic exchange field and the superconducting condensate, superconductivity may vary with temperature monotonically, non-monotonically, or even reentrantly, all of which can be tuned by external magnetic fields. Here, we present a unified theoretical framework and construct comprehensive phase diagrams that capture these regimes and predict new phenomena, including doublereentrant superconductivity. We further demonstrate how magnetic fields drive systematic shifts between distinct temperature-dependent behaviors, thereby explaining recent experimental results and predicting new transitions. In addition, we show that the field-induced enhancement of superconductivity, previously observed as a slight increase in Tc, can under certain conditions become dramatic.</p>

By switching the dimensionless flux per plaquette between a set of values $\{p_j/q_j\}$ the Floquet quasienergy spectrum is folded into Q = lcm$\{q_j\}$ bands. We determine closed form analytical solutions for the quasienergy spectrum and Chern numbers for the -1/2 $\to$ 1/2 flux switching case, as well as the Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin (RLBL) winding invariants W numerically, and construct the corresponding topological phase diagram for arbitrary driving period. We find that generic flux-switching drives feature interlaced Hofstadter butterfly quasienergy spectra, and the gaps in the spectrum may be labeled according to a Diophantine equation which relates the quasienergy gap index to the fluxes attained in the drive and their associated per-step windings.</p>

            <p>We propose and analyze a new variation of the so-called {\em exponential Hopfield model}, a recently introduced family of associative neural networks with unprecedented storage capacity. Our construction is based on a cost function defined through exponentials of standard quadratic loss functions, which naturally favors configurations corresponding to perfect recall. Despite not being a mean-field system, the model admits a tractable mathematical analysis of its dynamics and retrieval properties that agree with those for the original exponential model introduced by Ramsauer and coworkers. By means of a signal-to-noise approach, we demonstrate that stored patterns remain stable fixed points of the zero-temperature dynamics up to an exponentially large number of patterns in the system size. We further quantify the basins of attraction of the retrieved memories, showing that while enlarging their radius reduces the overall load, the storage capacity nonetheless retains its exponential scaling. An independent derivation within the perfect recall regime confirms these results and provides an estimate of the relevant prefactors. Our findings thus complement and extend previous studies on exponential Hopfield networks, establishing that even under robustness constraints these models preserve their exceptional storage capabilities. Beyond their theoretical interest, such networks point towards principled mechanisms for massively scalable associative memory, with potential implications for both neuroscience-inspired computation and high-capacity machine learning architectures.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-enforced Moiré Topology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunzhe Liu, Kaijie Yang, Chao-Xing Liu, Jiabin Yu</p>
            <p>Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moiré materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moiré band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moiré unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moiré bands from atomic symmetry data and moiré symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moiré symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moiré bands, as long as the moiré band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moiré Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moiré topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moiré potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moiré symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moiré topology, and we verify one such combination using a moiré model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is generalizable to other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to discover and design new topologically nontrivial moiré materials.</p>

            <p>We investigated the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model across clean and disordered regimes using exact numerical technique of a four-site lattice under Lindblad dynamics with local dephasing noise. By systematically varying hopping strength, onsite interactions, Stark potentials, and random disorder, we probe relaxation dynamics toward a common steady state using trace distance, relative entropy, entanglement asymmetry, and $\ell_1$-norm of coherence metrics. Our results reveal that QME emerges prominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive nonlinear relaxation pathways, enabling initially distant states to overtake closer ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional thermalization, whereas Stark potentials and random disorder suppress QME by inducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to the pronounced effects of Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry proves to be particularly sensitive to the symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME. These findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous relaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in experimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems.</p>

            <p>Light offers a route to engineer new phases of matter far from equilibrium, including transient states suggestive of superconducting, charge-ordered, and excitonic ordering behavior. Yet it remains unclear how optical excitation can dynamically produce long-range phase coherence-a defining feature of true order such as superconductivity-rather than merely enhancing local pairing. Here we show that impulsively driven low-frequency phonons enhance long-range electronic correlations in a low-dimensional metal. Through numerically exact simulations, we demonstrate that slow phonons suppress dynamical disorder, enabling buildup of coherence and enhancement of charge (and pairing) orders. These findings provide direct evidence that light can mediate enhancement of long-range order and suggest that future experimental strategies-such as the design of selective excitations of narrow phonon distributions to limit dephasing-may offer viable routes to design and stabilize transient superconducting states.</p>

            <h2>Mechanisms of Anomalous Three-Body Loss in a Population Imbalanced Three-Component Fermi Gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kajsa-My Tempest, Chris H. Greene</p>
            <p>Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The three-body Schrödinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally averaged $\langle K_3 \rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ also explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy is reduced, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products, rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.</p>

            <p>Understanding which minimal effective model captures the essential physics of cuprates is a key step towards unraveling the mechanism behind high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Recent measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor (DSF) in cuprate ladder compounds have indicated the presence of a large effective attraction in the single-band Hubbard model, possibly mediated by phonons. Here, we demonstrate that similar DSF features can also be captured by $t$-$J$ descriptions with or even without any attractive term. Motivated by this observation, we systematically investigate the strength and origin of different contributions to the single-band Hamiltonians by downfolding either from the three-band Emery model or the electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein model. For one-dimensional systems, we find that the extended versions of both single-band descriptions can reproduce the experimentally observed DSF signatures. Finally, we extend our analysis to two dimensions by comparing two-hole correlation functions for the different single-band models. Our results provide new insights into the long-standing question of which single-band Hamiltonian can capture the essential physics of cuprates.</p>

The total quantum work and the corresponding efficiency of the heat engine can be enhanced due to the coherence consumption of the demon. In addition, we discuss an universal information heat engine driven by quantum coherence. The extractable work of this heat engine is limited by the quantum coherence, even if it has no classical thermodynamic cost. This resource-driven viewpoint provides a direct and effective way to clarify the thermodynamic processes where the coherent superposition of states cannot be ignored.</p>

Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $|001\rangle \leftrightarrow |110\rangle$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). This approach simultaneously enhances gate fidelity while preserving spectral isolation, ensuring compatibility with existing all-microwave controlled-Z gate frameworks. The protocol exhibits intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced qubit parameter variations. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</p>

            <h2>Critical Iridium Demands arising from future Expansion of Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernhard Wortmann, Detlef Stolten, Heidi Heinrichs</p>
            <p>Proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is a key technology for producing green hydrogen, but its scalability is limited by the use of scarce materials, particularly iridium. Iridium oxide, the preferred anode catalyst in PEMEL, offers exceptional stability but is produced only as a by-product of platinum mining, with annual output around 7.5 tons. This study estimates future iridium demand for PEMEL under various deployment scenarios and technological advances. Results show that meeting net zero targets will require both significant improvements in catalyst efficiency and access to roughly 30\% of global iridium production annually. Supply shortages could arise as early as 2030, earlier than previously anticipated. The analysis also reveals that long-term iridium needs beyond 2040 are significantly underestimated. These findings underscore the urgent need for innovation in material efficiency and recycling, and the importance of integrating resource constraints into energy policy and technology planning to ensure a sustainable hydrogen transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lijie Ding, Changwoo Do</p>
            <p>We introduce SasAgent, a multi-agent AI system powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates small-angle scattering (SAS) data analysis by leveraging tools from the SasView software and enables user interaction via text input. SasAgent features a coordinator agent that interprets user prompts and delegates tasks to three specialized agents for scattering length density (SLD) calculation, synthetic data generation, and experimental data fitting. These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision. This work showcases the potential of LLM-driven AI systems to streamline scientific workflows and enhance automation in SAS research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Vegh</p>
            <p>We propose a folded string moving in rigid AdS$_2$ with imaginary radius squared as a dual of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model at its conformal fixed point. In standard AdS$_2$, the string is represented by two massless particles connected by straight string segments. The particles move at the speed of light, abruptly reversing direction at turning points. We describe the system using the lightcone coordinates of these points, with the Poisson structure obtained from the Peierls bracket. In AdS$_2$ with imaginary radius squared, quantization of the string's mass-squared in momentum-fraction space yields a Pöschl-Teller equation, reproducing the SYK operator spectrum.</p>

            <h2>Room Temperature Single Photon Detection at 1550 nm using van der Waals Heterojunction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nithin Abraham, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Kausik Majumdar</p>
            <p>Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.</p>

            <p>The issue of anomalous high magnetoresistance, beyond the Jullière model, observed in nonmagnetic electrode-chiral molecular-ferromagnetic electrode devices has puzzled the community for a long time. Here, by considering the magnetic proximity effect which shifts the nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic interface toward chiral molecules, we show the anomalous high magnetoresistance beyond the spin polarization in ferromagnetic electrodes even in the very weak spin-orbit coupling. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance. These results elucidate the interaction between chiral molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes and facilitate the design of chiral-based spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement Asymmetry and Quantum Mpemba Effect for Non-Abelian Global Symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harunobu Fujimura, Soichiro Shimamori</p>
            <p>Entanglement asymmetry is a measure that quantifies the degree of symmetry breaking at the level of a subsystem. In this work, we investigate the entanglement asymmetry in $\widehat{su}(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model and discuss the quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry, the phenomenon that the more symmetry is initially broken, the faster it is restored. Due to the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, spontaneous breaking of continuous global symmetries is forbidden in $1+1$ dimensions. To circumvent this no-go theorem, we consider excited initial states which explicitly break non-Abelian global symmetry. We particularly focus on the initial states built from primary operators in the fundamental and adjoint representations. In both cases, we study the real-time dynamics of the Rényi entanglement asymmetry and provide clear evidence of quantum Mpemba effect for SU$(N)$ symmetry. Furthermore, we find a new type of quantum Mpemba effect for the primary operator in the fundamental representation: increasing the rank $N$ leads to stronger initial symmetry breaking but faster symmetry restoration. Also, increasing the level $k$ leads to weaker initial symmetry breaking but slower symmetry restoration. On the other hand, no such behavior is observed for adjoint case, which may suggest that this new type of quantum Mpemba effect is not universal.</p>

            <p>The multimode ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime has emerged as a novel platform for accessing previously inaccessible phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Of particular interest are cavity-mediated correlations between local and nonlocal excitations, or equivalently, between modes at zero and finite in-plane momentum modes, which offer new opportunities for controlling light--matter interactions across space. However, direct experimental evidence of such interactions has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate nonlocal multimode coupling in a Landau polariton system, where cavity photons simultaneously interact with the zero-momentum cyclotron resonance and finite-momentum magnetoplasmons of a two-dimensional electron gas in a GaAs quantum well. Our slot cavities, with their subwavelength mode volumes, supply in-plane momentum components that enable the excitation of finite-momentum matter modes. Terahertz time-domain magnetospectroscopy measurements reveal a clear splitting of the upper-polariton branch, arising from hybridization between magnetoplasmon modes and the cavity--cyclotron-resonance hybrids. Extracted coupling strengths confirm USC of the cyclotron resonance and strong coupling of the magnetoplasmon modes to the cavity field, respectively. The experimental results are well captured by the multimode Hopfield model and finite-element simulations. These findings establish a pathway for engineering multimode light--matter interactions involving zero- and finite-momentum matter modes in the USC regime.</p>

Relying on partially lifted random duality theory (pl RDT) concepts we introduce an analytical mechanism that produces easy to compute lower and upper GSE bounds for \emph{any} spin sets. We uncover that these bounds actually match in case of fully spherical sets thereby providing optimal GSE values for spherical multipartite pure $p$-spin models. Numerical evidence further suggests that our upper and lower bounds may match even in the Ising scenarios. As such developments are rather intriguing, we formulate several questions regarding the connection between our bounds matching generality on the one side and the spin sets structures on the other.</p>

            <p>We report on the free decay of quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in superfluid $^4$He confined within nanofluidic channels. Using a pump-probe technique, we observe a complex decay of the vortex density $L(t)$ that deviates from a simple power law. The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as $L\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow. A numerical model that treats pinning as a velocity-dependent effective mutual friction successfully reproduces the essential features of our experimental observations.</p>

The proposed implementation extends the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation by a strain-induced effective field and concurrently solves the elastic equation of motion, while correctly incorporating stress and strain discontinuities at material interfaces. We then present a comprehensive set of examples, ranging from static stress configurations over material boundaries to simulations of surface acoustic wave attenuation in magnetically structured thin and thick films. These computational experiments both validate the implementation and underscore the importance of properly handling jump and boundary conditions in magnon-phonon interaction studies.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions, showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.</p>

            <p>Optomechanical interactions between mechanical oscillators and an electromagnetic field induce controllable modifications in mechanical fluctuation. When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously, optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode (target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing. This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant potential for enhancing precision measurements.</p>

By mapping the problem to a stochastic partial differential equation, as it is standard approach in field theory, we are able to numerically sample the distribution around the maximum likelihood path. We then analytically consider the perturbative expansion around the local and linear solution, and at the leading-order correction to the variance we find novel terms which depend on the local shape of the maximum likelihood path. We show that this shape correction is statistically most important in the variance expansion than the nonlinearity corrections. We then demonstrate the general applicability of the simulation method by extending it to the case of uncertain event times and by estimating the mortality rate in Venice during the 1348 Black Death epidemics from indirect evidence.</p>

            <p>Engineered dissipation is emerging as an alternative tool for quantum state control, enabling high-fidelity preparation, transfer and stabilization, and access to novel phase transitions. We realize a tunable, state-resolved laser-induced loss channel for individual Rydberg atoms, in both non-interacting and strongly correlated settings. This capability allows us to reveal interaction-driven shifts of the exceptional point separating quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes, and to demonstrate interaction-enhanced decay. By exploiting interaction-dependent energy level shifts, we observe a configuration-selective two-body Zeno effect that freezes target spin states. We theoretically show that when this mechanism is extended to many-body chains it allows for the dissipative distillation of unwanted spin configurations. These experimental studies establish a versatile approach for exploring strongly interacting, open quantum spin systems, and opens possible new routines for dissipative preparation of correlated quantum states in Rydberg atom arrays.</p>

            <p>Using holographic duality, we investigate thermalization process when two finite-size quantum critical systems are brought into thermal contact along a perfectly transmitting interface. Through real-time simulations of gravitational dynamics, which are spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic and are confined within two dynamical bulk branes, we identify three distinct thermalization patterns governed by the energy imbalance (temperature difference) and system size. For systems with large size and small energy imbalance, we observe recurrent cycles of formation and collapse of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). Under large energy imbalance, shock waves persist for a prolonged period with sustained boundary reflections, while rarefaction waves rapidly homogenize. When the system size is sufficiently small, dissipation dominates and leads to oscillatory decay without sustained NESS or shock structure. In sharp contrast to diffusive systems, we uncover that wave-propagated energy transfer together with boundary reflections enables nearly complete energy swapping between subsystems during thermalization. Our results reveal rich thermalization dynamics in finite-size quantum critical systems across spatial scales and energy gradient regimes.</p>

            <p>The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model, as the simplest realization of a lattice gauge theory, exhibits rich and unconventional physics. One of its most remarkable features is disorder-free localization, where localization emerges not from explicit quenched disorder but from static background $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges, leading to persistent memory of the initial state. In this work, we investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum dissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained more robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This dissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of initial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned configurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with decoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for stabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum systems.</p>

In this work, focusing on generalized Aubry-André-Harper models, we demonstrate that high-harmonic generation phenomenon serves as a powerful probe of localization transitions and mobility edges in quasicrystals. We introduce a new order parameter--dipole mobility--which captures the impact of intraband dipole transitions and enables classification of nonlinear optical regimes, where excitation and high-harmonic generation yield can differ by orders of magnitude. We show that the cutoff frequency of harmonics is strongly influenced by the position of the mobility edge, providing a robust and experimentally accessible signature of localization transitions in quasicrystals.</p>

            <p>This paper extends previous work on echo chambers modeled by an Ising-like system at zero temperature (1. Echo Chambers and random Polarization, Symmetry 2024, 16(12), 1566). There, polarization emerged as a spontaneous symmetry-breaking process with a randomly selected direction. Here using a mean-field analysis and Monte Carlo simulations I show that this mechanism is highly vulnerable to minimal distortions. An external symmetry-breaking field, even vanishingly small, suffices to impose a global direction and suppress opposite domains, producing distorted full polarization. In contrast, a handful of quenched local fields with zero average do not erase polarization but reorganize it into opposing domains. Remarkably, as few as two opposed fields, if placed at tipping sites, can redirect the entire system. These fragile sites, indistinguishable from others, act as hidden tipping points that amplify microscopic biases into macroscopic outcomes. Difference in local field proportions is found to be instrumental to guarantee a winning majority. The results highlight how minimal, strategically placed interventions can override autonomous self-organization. The results could, if applicable on social media platforms, question their presumed democratic nature of consensus.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingze Qiu</p>
            <p>The uncertainty principle is fundamentally rooted in the algebraic asymmetry between observables. We introduce a new class of uncertainty relations grounded in the resource theory of asymmetry, where incompatibility is quantified by an observable's intrinsic, state-independent capacity to break the symmetry associated with another. This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the asymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states that can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the near-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a universally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving tighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities, which are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as prethermalization and many-body localization. This work provides both a new conceptual lens for understanding quantum uncertainty and a powerful toolkit for its application.</p>

            <p>A swimming microorganism stirs the surrounding fluid, creating a flow field that governs not only its locomotion and nutrient uptake, but also its interactions with other microorganisms and the environment. Despite its fundamental importance, capturing this flow field and unraveling its biological implications remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we report the first direct, time-resolved measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) flow field generated by a single, free-swimming microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a widely studied model organism for flagellar motility. Supported by hydrodynamic modeling and simulations, our measurements resolve how established two-dimensional (2D) flow features such as in-plane vortices and the stagnation point emerge from and shape the 3D structure of the algal flow. More importantly, we reveal unexpected low-Reynolds-number flow phenomena including micron-sized vortex rings and a periodic train of traveling vortices and uncover topological changes in the underlying fluid structure associated with the puller-to-pusher transition of an alga, substantially deepening our understanding of algal motility. Biologically, access to the complete 3D flow field enables rigorous quantification of the alga's energy expenditure, as well as its swimming and feeding efficiency, significantly improving the precision of these key physiological metrics. Taken together, our study demonstrate extraordinary vortex dynamics in inertialess flows and advances fundamental knowledge of microhydrodynamics and its influence on microbial behavior.

            <p>Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.</p>

            <p>We study open boundary conditions for the $D^{(2)}_3$ spin chain, which shares connections with the six-vertex model, under staggering, and also to the antiferromagnetic Potts model. By formulating a suitable transfer matrix that is related to $K$ matrices and to the Jimbo $R$-matrix, we obtain an analytical expression for the Hamiltonian, as a logarithmic derivative of the transfer matrix, under open boundary conditions. Such computations have connections with several objects studied in Integrable Probability, which underlie exactly solvable structures.</p>

            <h2>AC Josephson Signatures of the Superconducting Higgs Mode</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aritra Lahiri, Sang-Jun Choi, Björn Trauzettel</p>
            <p>The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</p>

            <h2>Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo</p>
            <p>We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability for Canonical and non-Canonical Statistics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruo-Xun Zhai, C.P. Sun</p>
            <p>We extend the Carathéodory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</p>

            <h2>Effect of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy on charge transport in a junction with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milena Filipovic</p>
            <p>Anisotropic magnetic molecules can be employed to manipulate charge transport in molecular nanojunctions. Charge transport through a molecular orbital connected to two leads and exchange-coupled with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin in a constant magnetic field is studied here. Both the magnetic field and the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin modulate the total precession frequency. The precessing molecular magnetization drives inelastic tunneling processes between electronic quasienergy levels. The dc-bias voltages allow to unveil the quasienergy levels, Larmor frequency, and the anisotropy parameter, through characteristics of charge-transport measurements involving features such as steps, peaks and dips. Quantum interference effects between states connected with spin-flip events are reflected in the shot noise as peak-dip (dip-peak) features, resembling Fano-like resonance profiles, and are controlled by the anisotropy parameter and Larmor frequency. Under zero bias, the increase of the anisotropy parameter enables the decrease of the precession frequency or alters the precession direction, and shot noise is reduced. Furthermore, it is possible to adjust the anisotropy parameter to suppress the precession frequency, leading to the suppression of shot noise. The results show that in the given setup, the charge current and shot noise can be controlled by the magnetic anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the $\eta$ symmetry of the pump-induced $\eta$-pairing state in the Hubbard chain can be transiently broken by an additionally applied probe pulse. This leads to characteristic dynamic Higgs oscillations of the $\eta$-pair correlations during the probe pulse and a sharp dynamic negative optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega;t)$, which appears above the equilibrium Mott gap $\omega>\Delta_{\rm c}$, long after the pump pulse is finished. This negative peak in the real part of $\sigma(\omega;t)$ is a distinctive hallmark of the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing state, distinguishing it from parameter regimes dominated by incoherent doublon formation, which do not exhibit this feature. Remarkably, the broadband probe pulse then leads to the emission of photons with the Higgs frequency.</p>

            <p>We report pressure-induced superconductivity in the spinel CuIr2S4 with a transition temperature Tc reaching 18.2 K, establishing a new record for this class of materials and surpassing the decades-old limit of 13.7 K. Our electrical transport and synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies up to 224 GPa reveal the emergence of \textbf{two distinct superconducting phases} from a charge-ordered insulating state. The first phase (SC-I) appears around 18 GPa, forming a superconducting dome that peaks at 18.2 K at 133 GPa. Above 111.8 GPa, a second, lower-Tc phase (SC-II) emerges and coexists with SC-I over a broad pressure range. These superconducting phases are intimately linked to a cascade of structural transitions that systematically distort the frustrated pyrochlore lattice of Ir atoms. Our results redefine the potential for superconductivity in spinels and showcase a pathway to high-Tc pairing directly from a correlated insulating state driven by lattice tuning.</p>

            <p>Intercalated van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials host unique magnetic properties due to the interplay of competing interlayer and intralayer exchange couplings, which depend on the intercalant concentration within the van der Waals gaps. Magnetic vdW compound chromium telluride, Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$, has demonstrated rich magnetic phases at various Cr concentrations, such as the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases in Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ (equivalently, Cr$_{5}$Te$_8$). The compound is induced by intercalating 0.25 Cr atom per unit cell within the van der Waals gaps of CrTe$_2$. In this work, we report a notably increased Curie Temperature and an emergent in-plane spin fluctuation by slightly reducing the concentration of Cr intercalants in Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$. Moreover, the intercalated Cr atoms form a metastable 2$\times$2 supercell structure that can be manipulated by electron beam irradiation. This work offers a promising approach to tuning magnetic and structural properties by adjusting the concentration of intercalated magnetic atoms.</p>

            <p>When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</p>

            <p>We studied the structural and magnetic properties of the solid solution Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B through theoretical and experimental approaches. Powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray Pair Distribution Function analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that the Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B solid solution crystallizes in the $\beta$-FeB structure type up to x = 0.6-0.7 and exhibits anisotropic unit cell volume contraction with increasing Ni concentration. Magnetic measurements showed a transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism around x = 0.7. For x = 0.5, the low (< 0.3 $\mu_{B}$) magnetic moments suggest itinerant magnetism despite the relatively high Curie temperature (up to 225 K). Theoretical calculations indicated different types of magnetic orderings depending on the Fe/Ni atomic order, with the antiferromagnetic state being stable for ordered FeNiB$_{2}$, whereas the ground state is ferromagnetic for the disordered alloy. Calculations also predicted the coexistence of low- and high-spin states in Fe atoms around the composition with x=0.5, in line with the experimental evidence from $^{57}$Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The two magnetically distinct Fe sites for x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 observed by $^{57}$Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy can also be interpreted as two magnetically different regions or clusters that could affect the critical behavior near a quantum magnetic transition based on a potential ferromagnetic quantum critical point identified computationally and experimentally near x=0.64. This work highlights the complex interplay between structure and magnetism in Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B alloys, suggesting areas for future research on quantum critical behavior.</p>

            <p>Interface-induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T-CrTe2 layer, a two-dimensional ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T-CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto-chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yung-Yeh Chang, Kazuma Saito, Chen-Hsuan Hsu</p>
            <p>Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits prominent correlated phenomena in two distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a quasi-two-dimensional spin helix phase within the localized spins emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity, reflected in the scaling exponents of various correlation functions, accessible through electrical means and by adjusting the twist angle. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids. Integrating critical aspects of Luttinger liquid physics, magnetism, and Kondo physics in twisted bilayer graphene, our findings offer insights into similar correlated phenomena across a broad range of twisted van der Waals structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Li, Deng Pan, Ting Qu, Yuliang Jin</p>
            <p>Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems.</p>

            <p>Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sandip Roy, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Anil Kumar Dasanna</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of semiflexible polymers driven by motor proteins (MPs) in two-dimensional motility assays under harmonic confinement. Using a coarse-grained agent-based model that incorporates stochastic motor attachment, detachment, and force generation, we study how activity, filament rigidity, and confinement interact to control polymer behavior. We construct dynamical behavior maps as a function of Péclet number, motor processivity, and trap strength. We find a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region, and obtain a scaling relation for the critical Péclet number, which is supported by simulation data across a range of parameters. Polymer flexibility strongly influences confinement: flexible filaments are more easily trapped, while increasing rigidity destabilizes confinement. Processivity of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the trap. Under moderate confinement and activity, we observe the emergence of stable spiral conformations. The center-of-mass dynamics is analyzed through the mean square displacement, showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Additionally, time series analysis of the excess kurtosis shows the variation of the non-Gaussian fluctuations with trap strength and activity. Our results provide a minimal physical framework to understand the dynamic organization of active filaments under confinement, with relevance to in vitro motility assays, cytoskeletal filament manipulation by optical traps, and synthetic active polymer systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the Kitaev model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator RuCl3. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review begins with a brief review on QSLs in other systems, followed by a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on RuCl3. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</p>

            <p>Kondo screening of local moments in normal metals typically leads to hybridized conduction and valence bands separated by a Kondo gap, resulting in an insulating state at half-band filling. We show a dramatic change of this scenario in a Dirac-semimetal-based correlated system -- a bilayer honeycomb lattice heterostructure where the local moment lattice is stacked on a Dirac semimetal breaking the inversion symmetry. This system is modeled by an extended Anderson honeycomb lattice involving the real-space dependence of major interlayer hybridization parameters on the relative sliding distance along the armchair direction. First, we unveil the multiple Kondo scales and the successive Kondo breakdown transitions in this correlated heterostructure under sliding. Second, we demonstrate the existence of a genuine selective Kondo screening phase which is stabilized near the A-B stack pattern and is accessible by applying the interlayer voltage. Third, we find a nearly flat hybridized band located concomitantly within the Kondo gap, resulting in an unprecedented metallic state at the half-band filling. This unconventional heavy fermion state is characterized by the violation of Luttinger theorem and the appearance of a Van Hove singularity at the Fermi energy. The general sliding-driven band structure landscape and the implications of our results for the broad context of multiorbital Kondo physics are briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>The kinetic process of mechanical amorphization plays a central role in tailoring material properties. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how this process depends on loading parameters is critical for optimizing mechanical amorphization and tuning material performance. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate oscillatory deformation-induced amorphization in three glass-forming intermetallic systems, addressing two unresolved challenges: (1) the relationship between amorphization efficiency and mechanical loading, and (2) energy absorption dynamics during crystal-to-amorphous (CTA) transitions. Our results demonstrate a decoupling between amorphization efficiency--governed by work rate and described by an effective temperature model--and energy absorption, which adheres to the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive relation. Crucially, the melting enthalpy emerges as a key determinant of the energy barrier, establishing a thermodynamic analogy between mechanical amorphization and thermally induced melting. This relationship provides a universally applicable metric to quantify amorphization kinetics. By unifying material properties and loading conditions, this work establishes a predictive framework for controlling amorphization processes. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of deformation-driven phase transitions and offer practical guidelines for designing materials with tailored properties for ultrafast fabrication, ball milling, and advanced mechanical processing techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kieran Hymas, Alessandro Soncini</p>
            <p>Molecules with an odd number of electrons typically display paramagnetic behaviour in a uniform magnetic field. Single-molecule toroics -- a family of open shell lanthanide complexes -- instead display an unprecedented vanishing magnetization. The anomaly is reconciled by degenerate quantum states where electron spins and orbital currents give rise to time-odd and space-odd magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments, that carry a vanishing magnetic dipole. Resilient to stray magnetic fields and susceptible to electric manipulation, toroidal moments have attracted interest for spintronic, magnonic, and photonic applications. While macroscopic toroidal moments feature in some extended systems, molecular toroidal states have yet to be observed, as it remains unclear how existing experimental set-ups could split degenerate states carrying counter-rotating vortices. We propose a realistic pulsed radiation protocol to polarise and observe molecular toroidal moments in a class of MDy$_6$ (M = Al$^{3+}$, Cr$^{3+}$) molecules with coupled Dy$_3$ toroidal moieties. Three resonant MW-pulses -- delivered sequentially or simultaneously -- selectively and coherently transfers population to a long-lived toroidally-polarised state whose ensuing magneto-electric properties provide a read-out mechanism. Our results provide a strategy to measure and coherently manipulate toroidal states in molecular systems, which is expected to trigger applications of molecular toroidal states to quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mengyao Zhou, Hao-Ran Chang, Lijun Yang, Long Liang</p>
            <p>Noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals provide a platform for investigating the interplay among magnetism, inversion symmetry breaking, and topologically nontrivial Weyl fermions. The Weyl-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction may be related to the magnetic orders observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals. Previous studies of RKKY interaction between magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals found Heisenberg, Ising-like, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) types of interactions. However, different range functions are obtained in the literature. In this work, we calculate the Weyl-mediated RKKY interaction by using the divergence-free imaginary-time formalism and obtain exact analytical results at finite temperature. The discrepancies among zero temperature range functions in the literature are resolved. At nonzero temperature, the interaction strength decays exponentially in the long distance limit. But in the short distance limit, the DM interaction shows a thermal enhancement, an effect persists up to higher temperature for shorter distance. This provides a mechanism stabilizing the helical order observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Crystal structure prediction with host-guided inpainting generation and foundation potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peichen Zhong, Xinzhe Dai, Bowen Deng, Gerbrand Ceder, Kristin A. Persson</p>
            <p>Unconditional crystal structure generation with diffusion models faces challenges in identifying symmetric crystals as the unit cell size increases. We present the Crystal Host-Guided Generation (CHGGen) framework to address this challenge through conditional generation using an inpainting method, which optimizes a fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host structure to improve the success rate for symmetric structure generation. By integrating inpainting structure generation with a foundation potential for structure optimization, we demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures, particularly for systems with partial occupancy or intercalation chemistry. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials discovery.</p>

            <h2>Robust cross-chain surface interstitial electronic states and doping-enhanced superconductivity in monolayer $M_2$N ($M$= Ti, Zr, Hf) electrides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Da-Bao Zha, Peng Jiang, Yan-Ling Li, Hai-Qing Lin</p>
            <p>The exploration of electrides holds great promise for advancing both fundamental physics and chemistry, owing to their unique characteristics arising from loosely bound interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a class of cross-chain electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $\mathcal{O}$. Notably, the cross-chain electride characteristic in the $M_2$N monoalyers is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced and robust surface interstitial electronic state. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering another pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</p>

            <h2>Accelerating point defect photo-emission calculations with machine learning interatomic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartikeya Sharma, Antoine Loew, Haiyuan Wang, Fredrik A. Nilsson, Manjari Jain, Miguel A. L. Marques, Kristian S. Thygesen</p>
            <p>We introduce a computational framework leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to dramatically accelerate the calculation of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of atomic or molecular emitters with ab initio accuracy. By replacing the costly density functional theory (DFT) computation of phonon modes with much faster MLIP phonon mode calculations, our approach achieves speed improvements exceeding an order of magnitude with minimal precision loss. We benchmark the approach using a dataset comprising ab initio emission spectra of 791 color centers spanning various types of crystal point defects in different charge and magnetic states. The method is also applied to a molecular emitter adsorbed on a hexagonal boron nitride surface. Across all the systems, we find excellent agreement for both the Huang-Rhys factor and the PL lineshapes. This application of universal MLIPs bridges the gap between computational efficiency and spectroscopic fidelity, opening pathways to high-throughput screening of defect-engineered materials. Our work not only demonstrates accelerated calculation of PL spectra with DFT accuracy, but also makes such calculations tractable for more complex materials.</p>

            <h2>Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Borges, Peter Lunts, Sung-Sik Lee</p>
            <p>We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM), using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group. Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.</p>

            <h2>Extended Yard Sale model of wealth distribution on Erdős-Rényi random networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolás Vazquez Von Bibow, Juan I. Perotti</p>
            <p>Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erdős-Rényi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.</p>

            <p>An interesting question in physics is how the correlation energy of atoms evolves upon forming a solid. Here, we address this problem for a specific case of double-layer FeSe. We used many-body wavefunction-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to compute the correlation energies of double-layer FeSe with different geometrical configurations and compared them with those of isolated Fe and Se atoms. Variational and diffusion QMC calculations were carried out with Slater Jastrow trial wavefunctions employing two alternative forms for the homogeneous two-body pair correlation term. The ground-state energy was obtained in the thermodynamic limit using two types of trial wave functions of JDFT, in which only the Jastrow factor is optimized while the Slater determinant is derived from the local density approximation, and JSD, where both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized simultaneously. Our results indicate that the correlation energy of double layer FeSe at the thermodynamic limit is mainly determined by the atomic contributions, with the bonding between atoms playing a comparatively minor role in it. After optimizing the interlayer separation of double-layer FeSe under tensile strain, we analyze the correlation energy as a function of strain and separation. We found that with increasing tensile stretch and interlayer spacing, the correlation energy of double-layer FeSe stochastically approaches that of its constituent atomic fragments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Sorkin, Thomas A. Witten</p>
            <p>Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems.</p>

            <p>Nanostructured tungsten has been reported as a possible alternative plasma-facing material due to its potential ability to self-heal radiation-induced defects, a property that is attributed to its high density of grain boundaries (GB). Here, we study the initial stages of self-healing at tungsten interfaces with molecular dynamics simulations driven by a machine-learning interatomic potential tailored to one of the most common GBs found in experiments. Our model accurately reproduces the ab initio potential energy surface derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and outperforms previously reported empirical and machine learning interatomic potentials in predicting defect energetics. The simulations reveal low-temperature defect migration to GBs driven by rapid dumbbell-like ordering and subsequent accommodation along GB grooves. In contrast to empirical potentials, which predict unexpected GB degradation at high temperatures after defect migration, our model maintains stable GB motifs over the investigated temperature range. The temperature-dependent defect counts, evaluated using an Arrhenius-like fit, yield an average interstitial migration energy of 0.048 eV, in agreement with experiment. This work underscores the capabilities of ab initio machine learning simulations in accurately modeling defect-GB interactions and highlights their potential to contribute to the development of radiation tolerant materials.</p>

            <p>In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</p>

            <p>We study the magnetic and electronic properties of Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$.We calculate the magnetic exchanges of Ni$_x$NbSe$_2$ ($x = 1/3, 1/4,$ and $1$) and find that the out-of-plane magnetic coupling depends on the Ni connectivity: it is ferromagnetic when Ni atoms stack on top of each other, and antiferromagnetic otherwise. Focusing on Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$, we identify a ground-state transition from a stripe antiferromagnetic phase with Kramers degeneracy to a ferromagnetic phase above a critical Coulomb interaction U$_C$. Spin--orbit coupling lowers U$_C$, aligns the easy axis along $z$, and stabilizes collinear AFM and FM states over the competing 120$^\circ$ phase. Ni intercalation also strongly modifies the electronic structure, replacing the $\Gamma$-point hole pocket of pristine NbSe$_2$ with an electron pocket and shifting the Van Hove singularity away from the Fermi level, thereby suppressing potential instabilities. Finally, we investigate the altermagnetic phase in the broader class T$_{0.25}$MX$_2$, finding that spin--orbit effects induce orbital antiferromagnetism with weak ferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the Néel vector orientation. Our results demonstrate that Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$ provides a versatile platform to explore and tune multiple competing magnetic phases that lie close in energy.</p>

            <p>Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Ghosh - Pan Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that is inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.</p>

This layer-resolved analysis offers a powerful tool for studying topological transport in complex materials, including heterostructures, and may guide the design of future devices based on the anomalous Hall effect with precise layer control.</p>

            <p>Metallic kagome lattices are attracting significant attention as they provide a platform to explore the interplay between topology and magnetism. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) plays a key role in unraveling their electronic structure. However, the analysis is often challenging due to the presence of multiple bands near the Fermi level. Indeed, each orbital generates three bands in a kagome lattice due to its three sites motif, which soon becomes complicated if many orbitals are present. To address this complexity, using ARPES matrix elements can be highly beneficial. First, band symmetry can be determined through selection rules based on light polarization. We emphasize that, in kagome lattices, as in all multi-site lattices, symmetry of the Bloch state is not only determined by the orbital character but also by the relative phase between the three sublattices. Additionally, interference between the three sublattices leads to a strong modulation of ARPES intensity across neighboring Brillouin zones. We show how unfolded band calculations capture these modulations, helping with band identification. We apply these ideas to CoSn, whose simple structure retains the key features of a kagome lattice. Using polarization dependent ARPES in several Brillouin zones, we isolate the dispersion of each band and discuss novel correlation effects, selectively renormalizing the bands crossing the Fermi level and shifting the others.</p>

            <p>We study the Efimov states in highly mass-imbalanced three-body systems composed of two identical heavy atoms and one light atom, focusing on the Er-Er-Li and Dy-Dy-Li cold-atom mixtures with strong dipole-dipole interactions between the heavy atoms. By solving the Born-Oppenheimer equation for varying $s$-wave scattering lengths between the heavy and light atoms, we demonstrate for both bosonic and fermionic systems that the Efimov spectra and hence the three-body parameters are universal even with the dipole interaction comparable in strength to the van der Waals interaction. While the bosonic systems exhibit Efimov states only in the $M_z=0$ channel, the fermionic systems show a characteristic doublet of the Efimov states in the $M_z=0$ and $M_z = \pm 1$ channels due to the interplay of finite angular momentum and the anisotropy of the dipole interaction. Both numerical results and analytical formula obtained with the first-order perturbation show that the ratio of the three-body parameters between these two fermionic channels exhibits universality, particularly well in the limit of large mass imbalance. Leveraging this universality, we provide quantitative predictions for the values and ratios of the three-body parameters for experimentally relevant Er-Li and Dy-Li isotopes.</p>

            <p>Pair-density-wave (PDW) states -- exotic superconductors with spatially modulated order -- are a long-sought-after phase of quantum materials, with the potential to unravel the mysteries of high-$T_c$ cuprates and other strongly correlated superconductors. Yet, surprisingly, a key signature of stable superconductivity, namely the positivity of the superfluid density, $n_s(T)$, has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we address this central issue by calculating $n_s(T)$, for a generic model two-dimensional PDW superconductor. We uncover a surprisingly large region of intrinsic instability, associated with negative $n_s(T)$, revealing that a significant portion of the parameter space thought to be physical cannot support superconducting order. This instability is driven by the large pairing momentum required to form the PDW state. In the remaining stable regime, we predict two striking and observable fingerprints: an anomalously small longitudinal superfluid response that is vulnerable to thermal fluctuations, and an unusual temperature dependence for $n_s(T)$ arising from the unique gapless excitation spectrum of the PDW state. These generally model independent, as well as experimentally relevant findings suggest that the fragility of the superfluid density poses a significant problem for the formation of stable, finite temperature PDW superconductivity.</p>

Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks.

We characterize in detail the ground-state phase transitions and identify coexistence regions between competing phases, capturing both first-order and continuous transitions. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of the competing length scales introduced by the hard-core repulsion in shaping the rich landscape of mesophases, emphasizing the interplay between intra-cluster structure and inter-cluster organization. This study provides a systematic framework that could support future investigations of classical thermal melting behavior or quantum phase transitions in similar cluster-forming systems.</p>

            <h2>Higher-Order Fermion Interactions in BCS Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego Rodriguez-Gomez, Jorge G. Russo</p>
            <p>We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.</p>

            <h2>Self-organisation -- the underlying principle and a general model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphael Blumenfeld</p>
            <p>Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <h2>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngjae Kim</p>
            <p>The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</p>

            <p>The coupling between real-space inhomogeneities coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states -- energetically isolated within the bulk band gap -- emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr_2Se_2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Néel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional Phase Separation and Fractal Interfaces of Colloids in Active Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pragya Kushwaha, Pratikshya Jena, Partha Sarathi Mondal, Sanjay Puri, Shradha Mishra, Vijayakumar Chikkadi</p>
            <p>Phase separation driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations is a hallmark of both living and synthetic active matter. Unlike equilibrium systems, where ordered states arise from the minimization of free energy, active systems are fueled by a constant injection of energy at the microscopic scale. The emergence of ordered phases in such driven systems challenges our conventional views of domain growth and interfacial structure. In this study, we investigate the coarsening of colloidal clusters in active liquids containing E. coli. Our experiments reveal that uniform dispersions of colloids and swimmers are inherently unstable, resulting in spontaneous phase separation characterized by fractal interfaces and unconventional kinetics. The correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamical scaling, with the size of colloidal domains growing as $t^{1/z}$, where $z \sim 4$, in contrast to the well-known growth laws for thermal systems with a conserved order parameter. Furthermore, the structure factor exhibits non-Porod behavior, indicating domains with fractal interfaces. This non-Porod behavior also manifests itself as a cusp singularity in the correlation function. We elucidate our experimental findings using a scalar field theory in which the nonequilibrium fluctuations arising from swimmer activity are modeled as spatio-temporally correlated noise. This coarse-grained model, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and detailed balance, successfully reproduces key experimental observations. Furthermore, it reveals a fluctuating microphase separation, where the initial domain growth, following $t^{1/4}$ scaling, is eventually arrested, thereby shedding new light on the microscopic origins of unconventional phase separation of colloids in active liquids.</p>

            <p>Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance the grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the adiponitrile-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and 'well-diffusive' in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (~1M) than in saturated LiPF6-Adpn solutions (0.04M), and ions predominantly solvated by -CN groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.</p>

            <p>We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

            <h2>Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pietro M. Bonetti, Maine Christos, Alexander Nikolaenko, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$. We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Its mean field yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experiments. Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoyu Han, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, Qiang Gao, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</p>

            <h2>Permeability heterogeneity and bulk linear elasticity of displaced clay suspensions determine interfacial pattern morphologies in Hele-Shaw experiments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaibhav Raj Singh Parmar, Ranjini Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>When a less viscous Newtonian fluid displaces an aging aqueous clay suspension in a confined space, a rich array of interfacial patterns emerges due to a predominantly viscous instability. In the present work, we controlled the mechanical properties of clay suspensions by incorporating additives and studied the interfacial instabilities that resulted when these suspensions were radially displaced by water in a Hele-Shaw cell. When the elasticity of clay was low, the interfacial dynamics exhibited features of nonlinear viscous fingering in heterogeneous media. By tuning the nature and content of additives that delay clay aging, we uncovered two novel propagation mechanisms: pattern growth \textit{via} skewering and zig-zag finger propagation. These patterns have hitherto never been observed in experiments with colloidal systems. For moderate clay elasticities, we demonstrate here that shear-thinning-induced flow anisotropy leads to the formation of dendrites with dominant side branches. As clay elasticity increases due to the incorporation of salts, the energy required to create fractures becomes smaller than that for system-wide yielding. This scenario is characterized by the emergence of viscoelastic fractures. Our work demonstrates that incorporating additives is an effective strategy to manipulate the onset and growth of interfacial instabilities during the confined displacement of clay by miscible Newtonian fluids.</p>

            <h2>Physically Interpretable Descriptors Drive the Materials Design of Metal Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage</h2>

            <p>Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.</p>

            <h2>Hyperuniformity and conservation laws in non-equilibrium systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raphaël Maire, Ludivine Chaix</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, emerges generically from the interplay between conservation laws and non-equilibrium driving. The underlying mechanism for this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k) \sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear perturbations. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence in non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p>Spin-wave-based computing has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the fundamental limitations of CMOS technologies. However, the increasing demand for device miniaturization down to a 100 nm scale presents significant challenges for long-distance spin-wave transport. Gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Ga:YIG) offers a potential solution to these challenges due to its unique magnetic properties. The reduced saturation magnetization in Ga:YIG enables efficient excitation of exchange-dominated spin waves, which exhibit enhanced transport characteristics compared to dipolar-dominated modes in conventional materials. Here, we present the first comprehensive study combining experimental, analytical, and numerical investigations of spin-wave propagation in Ga:YIG waveguides down to 145 nm width and 73 nm thickness. Using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, TetraX simulations, and analytical dispersion calculations, we demonstrate that Ga:YIG waveguides support spin waves with significantly higher group velocities up to 600 m/s. This value remains constant for structures with different widths, leading to longer spin-wave propagation lengths in nanowaveguides compared to non-substituted YIG. These results reveal that gallium substitution provides access to faster and longer-lived spin waves, opening new possibilities for implementing this material in nanoscale magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Important advances have recently been made in the search for materials with complex multi-phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, this challenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses, ferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large-amplitude mode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by first-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds.</p>

            <p>Many physical systems can be modelled as parameter-dependent variational problems. In numerous cases, multiple equilibria co-exist, requiring the evaluation of their stability, and the monitoring of transitions between them. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability changes is embedded in a specific projection of the solutions, known as distinguished bifurcation diagrams. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends -- a class of problems frequently encountered in mechanics. Using these diagrams, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. Several instances of snap-back instability are reported, along with their dependence on system parameters through numerical examples. These findings have potential applications in the design of soft robot arms and other actuator designs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kühn, Gabriel Mahuas, Ulisse Ferrari</p>
            <p>Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.</p>

            <p>Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p>

Despite the absence of alignment interactions, the system exhibits flocking behavior characterized by high orientational order, while maintaining ordered hexagonal arrays. This emergent order arises from stochastic birth and death processes, offering a novel mechanism for flocking in proliferating cellular populations.</p>

            <p>The power of photothermal spectroscopic imaging to visualize antimicrobial interaction on the surface of individual bacteria cells has been demonstrated on the model system Bacillus subtilis and vancomycin using mid-infrared photo-induced force microscopy (PiF-IR, also mid-IR PiFM). High-resolution PiF contrasts obtained by merging subsequent PiF-IR scans at two different illumination frequencies revealed chemical details of cell wall destruction after 30 and 60 min incubation with vancomycin with a spatial resolution of $\approx 5$ nm. This approach compensates local intensity variations induced by near-field coupling of the illuminating electric field with nanostructured surfaces, which appear in single-frequency contrasts in photothermal imaging methods, as shown by [Anindo et al., J. Phys. Chem C, 2025, 129, 4517]. Known spectral shifts associated with hydrogen bond formation between vancomycin and the N-acyl-D-Ala4-D-Ala5 termini in the peptidoglycan cell wall have been observed in chemometrics of PiF-IR spectra from treated and untreated Bacillus subtilis harvested after 30 min from the same experiment. Spectral signatures of the vancomyin interaction have been located in the piecrust of a progressing septum with $\approx 10$ nm resolution using PiF contrasts of three selected bands of a PiF-IR hyperspectral scan of an individual Bacillus subtilis cell harvested after 30 min incubation. Our results are complemented by a discussion of imaging artifacts and the influence of parameter settings supporting further development towards standardization in the application of PiF-IR for visualizing the chemical interaction of antibiotics on the surface of microbes with few nanometer resolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Guo, Jaime Park, Frank X. Lee</p>
            <p>We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.</p>

            <h2>Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Lake</p>
            <p>We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</p>

            <h2>Accelerated Ostwald ripening by chemical activity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Sorkin, Ned S. Wingreen</p>
            <p>Phase separation of biomolecular condensates promotes membrane-free compartmentalization in cells. The dynamics of these biocondensates is routinely regulated by energy-consuming processes. Here, we devise a theory pinpointing how active chemical reactions, interconverting molecules between phase-separating and inert forms, can drive faster condensate coarsening. We find that mass conservation limits droplet volume growth to being linear in time regardless of activity, resembling the passive Lifshitz-Slyozov law. However, if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts, e.g., as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling dynamics such as in random unitary circuits. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</p>

            <h2>Rise and fall of nonstabilizerness via random measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Annarita Scocco, Wai-Keong Mok, Leandro Aolita, Mario Collura, Tobias Haug</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer Rényi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources.</p>

            <h2>Lessons from Chalcopyrites for Scaling Thin Film Perovskite Photovoltaic Technology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirjana Dimitrievska, Edgardo Saucedo, Stefaan De Wolf, Billy J. Stanbery, Veronica Bermudez Benito</p>
            <p>The growing demand for photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are lightweight, flexible, and seamlessly integrated into diverse applications has propelled interest in thin-film solar cells. Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition.</p>

            <h2>Deformation Driven Suction Cups: A Mechanics-Based Approach to Wearable Electronics</h2>

            <p>Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</p>

            <h2>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daisuke A. Takahashi</p>
            <p>We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schrödinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</p>

            <h2>Optimizing digital quantum simulation of open quantum lattice models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xie-Hang Yu, Hongchao Li, J. Ignacio Cirac, Rahul Trivedi</p>
            <p>Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Gliozzi, Federico Balducci, Giuseppe De Tomasi</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of domain growth when multipole moments of the order parameter are conserved. Following a quench into the ordered phase of the Ising model, the typical size of domains grows with time as $R(t) \sim t^{1/2}$ in the absence of conserved quantities. When the order parameter is conserved, the domain growth slows to $R(t) \sim t^{1/3}$. Conservation of higher moments of the order parameter fundamentally modifies this behavior: coarsening proceeds via anomalously slow growth. We analytically and numerically show that conservation of the $m$-th multipole moment causes domains to grow as $R(t) \sim t^{1/(2m+3)}$. This cascade of dynamical critical exponents characterizes a new family of non-equilibrium universality classes for fractonic systems.</p>

            <p>It has been suggested that non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (SPT), due to the lack of a stacking structure, do not have symmetric entanglers (globally symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits) connecting them. Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with $\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).</p>

            <h2>Tuning Nonradiative Recombination via Cation Substitution in Inorganic Antiperovskite Nitrides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchi Monga, Saswata Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>Inorganic antiperovskite nitrides have recently emerged as promising materials for photovoltaic applications, yet their nonradiative recombination dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine the influence of X-site cation substitution on the nonradiative electron-hole recombination in $\mathrm{X_{3}NSb}$ ($X = \mathrm{Ca}, \mathrm{Sr}, \mathrm{Ba}$). Ca- and Sr-based compounds adopt a cubic phase, whereas Ba stabilizes in a hexagonal structure, introducing pronounced symmetry-driven effects. Substituting Ca with Sr narrows the band gap, suppresses octahedral and band-edge fluctuations, reduces nonadiabatic (NA) coupling by $\sim 54\%$, and extends carrier lifetimes by a factor of $2.5$. In contrast, Ba substitution increases lattice distortion, widens the band gap, and enhances NA coupling beyond that of $\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$, thereby accelerating recombination through stronger lattice fluctuations. The resulting band gap fluctuations in $\mathrm{Ba_{3}NSb}$ also shorten decoherence times, following the trend $\mathrm{Ba_{3}NSb} < \mathrm{Ca_{3}NSb} < \mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$. Our results demonstrate how the interplay between band gap, NA coupling, and decoherence time governs recombination lifetimes, with $\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$ exhibiting the longest lifetime. These findings highlight the coupled influence of cation chemistry and crystal symmetry in tailoring carrier dynamics for high-performance antiperovskite-based optoelectronics materials.</p>

            <p>Applying angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we present compelling spectroscopic evidence demonstrating the intertwining and mutual interaction between the Kondo and kagome sublattices in heavy-fermion intermetallic compound YbV$_6$Sn$_6$. We reveal the Yb 4$f$-derived states near the Fermi level, along with the presence of bulk kagome bands and topological surface states. We unveil strong interactions between the 4$f$ and itinerant electrons, where the kagome bands hosting the Dirac fermions and van Hove singularities predominate. Such findings are well described using a $c$-$f$ hybridization model. On the other hand, our systematic characterization of magnetic properties demonstrates an unusually enhanced antiferromagnetic ordering, where the kagome-derived van Hove singularities near $E_F$ play a vital role in determining the unconventional nature of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction and Kondo coupling. These unique kagome-state-mediated exchange interactions have never been reported before and could lead to a novel phase diagram and various quantum critical behaviors in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and its siblings. Our results not only expand the family of exotic quantum phases entangled with kagome structure to the strongly correlated regime, but also establish YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ as an unprecedented platform to explore unconventional many-body physics beyond the standard Kondo picture.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit entangled excitons (SOEE) in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets provide a direct access to explore unconventional many body interactions in correlated electron systems. In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronouns temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T < TED to ~ 3 ps at T > TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>Flat bands, emergent in strongly correlated electron systems, stand at the frontier of condensed matter physics, providing fertile ground for unconventional quantum phases. Recent observations of dispersionless bands at the Fermi level in kagome lattice open the possibility of unifying the disjoint paradigms of topology and correlation-driven heavy fermion liquids. Here, we report the unprecedented coexistence of these mechanisms in the layered kagome metal YbCr6Ge6. At high temperatures, an intrinsic kagome flat band-arising from the frustrated hopping on the kagome lattice-dominates the Fermi level. Upon cooling, localized Yb 4f-states hybridize with the topological kagome flat bands, transforming this state into the Kondo resonance states that are nearly dispersionless across the entire Brillouin zone. Crystalline symmetry forbids hybridization along specific high-symmetry lines, which stabilizes Dirac crossings of heavy-fermion character. Topological analysis of the resulting gaps reveals both trivial and nontrivial Z2 invariants, establishing the emergence of a Dirac-Kondo semimetal phase. Taken together, these results identify YbCr6Ge6 as a prototype of a topological heavy-fermion system and a platform where geometric frustration, strong correlations, and topology converge, with broad implications for correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Van Hove singularities (vHs) located close to the Fermi level in Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) have profound influence on their electronic and transport characteristics. Specifically, magneto-transport and susceptibility measurements on CsV3Sb5 reveal an anomalous temperature dependence of the upper critical field H_c2 (T), characterized by a pronounced upward curvature for both in-plane and c-axis magnetic fields, with zero-temperature H_c2 values of ~6.0 T and ~1.2 T, respectively. Our theoretical analysis, using a newly developed single-band model incorporating vHs and gap anisotropy, suggests that the observed upper critical field behavior is predominantly driven by the anisotropy of the Fermi velocity originating from vHs, instead of multi-band effects or gap anisotropy. Increased electron scattering introduced by proton irradiation defects smears out the vHs, reduces anisotropy, and recovers the conventional H_c2 (T) behavior, corroborating our proposed model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Rao, Xiaoshui Lin, Xiwang Luo, Guangcan Guo, Han Pu, Ming Gong</p>
            <p>Superradiant phase transitions from cavity light-matter coupling have been widely explored across platforms. Here, we report a unilateral critical endpoint (UCEP) and a tricritical point (TCP) in the phase diagram of the cavity-coupled transverse Ising model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. At zero temperature, we demonstrate that this model hosts three phases separated by two second-order and one first-order transitions. These lines intersect at a TCP and a UCEP, the latter not captured by existing phase-transition paradigms. The UCEP displays one-sided criticality: approaching the point from one side, the system behaves as a second-order transition, while from the other side it is first-order. Correspondingly, two order parameters, respectively, undergo the first- and the second-order phase transitions at the same point. We construct a minimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f = c_{1}(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\ln{\vert\tilde{\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\vert}$, with the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$ being the order parameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a symmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single, direction-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of phase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum measurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform for exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with or without dissipation.</p>

This result continuously interpolates between the fermionic limit of a single qubit (g = 1) and the bosonic limit of a continuous-variable qumode (g -> 0). For the nu = 1/3 fractional quantum Hall state (g = 1/3), we predict a 2-bit capacity, observable as four distinct quantized conductance plateaus in quantum dot spectroscopy, providing a direct signature of anyonic statistics.</p>

Repeated pulse sequences enhance sensitivity to early-time two-body losses and reveal long-lived coherence between atom pairs and molecular states. The observed dynamics are accurately reproduced by our dynamical two-channel zero-range theory, which explicitly accounts for the resonance's narrow width and finite closed-channel decay, establishing a predictive framework for correlation dynamics in quantum gases near Fano-Feshbach resonances.</p>

            <p>Moiré lattices provide a highly tunable platform for exploring the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology. Introducing a second moiré pattern extends this paradigm: interference between the two moiré patterns produces a supermoiré modulation, opening a route to further tailor electronic properties. Twisted trilayer graphene generally exemplifies such a system: two distinct moiré patterns arise from the relative twists between adjacent graphene layers. Here, we report the observation of correlated phenomena across a wide range of twisted trilayer graphene devices whose twist angles lie along two continuous lines in the twist-angle parameter space. Depending on the degree of lattice relaxation, twisted trilayer graphene falls into two classes: moiré polycrystals, composed of periodic domains with locally commensurate moiré order, and moiré quasicrystals, characterized by smoothly varying local moiré configurations. In helically twisted moiré polycrystals, we observe an anomalous Hall effect, consistent with topological bands arising from domains with broken $xy$-inversion symmetry. In contrast, superconductivity appears generically in our moiré quasicrystals. A subset of these systems exhibits signatures of spatially modulated superconductivity, which we attribute to the supermoiré structure. Our findings uncover the organizing principles of the observed correlated phases in twisted trilayer graphene, highlight the critical roles of the supermoiré modulation and lattice relaxation, and suggest a broader framework in which magic conditions arise not as isolated points but as extended manifolds within the multi-dimensional twist-angle space of complex moiré materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Pal Singh, Erik Bernhart, Marvin Röhrle, Herwig Ott, Ludwig Mathey, Luigi Amico</p>
            <p>We investigate the transition from weak-link transport to the tunneling Josephson regime in a three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a cylindrical, tube-like trap. By varying the height of a localized barrier, we map out the smooth crossover between these regimes through measurements of the critical current and Josephson oscillations. In the weak-link regime of the Josephson junction, dissipative transport is mediated by solitonic excitations in the form of vortex rings, which drive phase slips and generate a finite chemical potential difference across the junction. Increasing the barrier height suppresses these hydrodynamics excitations, yielding a tunneling-dominated Josephson regime characterized by phononic excitations. These findings elucidate the interplay between geometry, excitations, and dissipation in atomtronic weak links, and provide a quantitative framework for engineering coherent matter-wave circuits. Our results show excellent agreement with numerical simulations and analytical models.</p>

            <h2>Optical selection rules of topological excitons in flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mara Lozano, Hong-Yi Xie, Bruno Uchoa</p>
            <p>Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states with an envelope wavefunction that has finite vorticity in momentum space, dictated by the topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin, which can have a net Chern number, and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, we find that topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of the microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>A One-Particle Density Matrix Framework for Mode-Shell Correspondence: Characterizing Topology in Higher-Order Topological Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel F. Martínez, Lucien Jezequel, Jens H. Bardarson, Thomas Klein Kvorning, Julia D. Hannukainen</p>
            <p>We present a framework for characterizing higher-order topological phases directly from the one-particle density matrix, without any reference to an underlying Hamiltonian. Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence, originally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states subject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts topological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology in a surrounding region, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In one-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local chiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant limit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order topological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell index implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle density matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence applies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural disorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the mode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in the amorphous limit. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a gapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical and diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Tse Li, Tzen Ong, Max Geier, Hsin Lin, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>Recent advances on neural quantum states have shown that correlations between quantum particles can be efficiently captured by {\it attention} -- a foundation of modern neural architectures that enables neural networks to learn the relation between objects. In this work, we show that a general-purpose self-attention Fermi neural network is able to find chiral $p_x \pm i p_y$ superconductivity in an attractive Fermi gas by energy minimization, {\it without prior knowledge or bias towards pairing}. The superconducting state is identified from the optimized wavefunction by measuring various physical observables: the pair binding energy, the total angular momentum of the ground state, and off-diagonal long-range order in the two-body reduced density matrix. Our work paves the way for AI-driven discovery of unconventional and topological superconductivity in strongly correlated quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Controllable Josephson diode effect, $0$-$π$ transition and switch effect in the superconductor/two-dimensional Weyl nodal line semimetal/superconductor junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Ting Liu, Shu-Chang Zhao, Qiang Cheng, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>We study the Josephson effects in the superconductor/two-dimensional Weyl nodal line semimetal/superconductor junctions using the Green's function method. When the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an external magnetic field coexist in the semimetal, the symmetries protecting the reciprocity of supercurrent can be broken and the Josephson diode effect with the nonreciprocity of supercurrent can be realized. A high efficiency exceeding $40\%$ can be achieved with the experimentally accessible values of the magnetic field and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The diode efficiency can be easily controlled by the direction and magnitude of the field and the strength of the spin-orbit coupling. When the spin-orbit coupling is absent or the external field is absent, the Josephson diode effect vanishes but the current-phase difference relations still show strong dependence on the field or the coupling. The tunable $0$-$\pi$ transition and the switch effect of supercurrent in the junctions can be formed if the direction of the field is rotated or the magnitude of the field and the strength of the coupling are changed. The obtained Josephson diode effect, the $0$-$\pi$ transition and the switch effect of supercurrent are helpful in the design of the quantum devices based on nodal line semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Spin Splitting Nernst Effect in Altermagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Jian Yi, Yue Mao, Xiancong Lu, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>Altermagnet is a distinctive magnet phase, which has spin-split energy band but with zero net magnetic moment. In this paper, we propose that altermagnet behaves spin splitting Nernst effect: Under a longitudinal temperature gradient, the electrons with opposite spins tend to split oppositely in the transverse direction, thus generating a transverse spin current. The spin splitting Nernst effect is understood from the contribution of the longitudinal wave vector to the transverse group velocity. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we calculate the spin-dependent transmission coefficient in the four-terminal altermagnet device. From the spin-dependent transmission coefficient, the nonzero transverse spin current from longitudinal temperature gradient is obtained, and the spin splitting Nernst effect is verified. We systematically study the parameter dependence of the spin splitting Nernst effect, while also performing symmetry analysis. The spin splitting Nernst effect can be easily regulated by Fermi surface energy, temperature, transport direction, and system size. Furthermore, in altermagnet, the $xy$-response and $yx$-response spin splitting Nernst coefficients are equal with $N_{s,xy}=N_{s,yx}$, different from the conventional spin Nernst effect where they are opposite. Meanwhile, the spin splitting Nernst effect require neither spin-orbit coupling nor net magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Topologically protected magnetoresistance by quantum anomalous Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Tao Lu, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>Recently, antiferromagnetic (AF) materials have attracted rapid attention, because they are considered as outstanding candidates to replace the widely used ferromagnets in the next generation of spintronics. We propose a magnetoresistance model based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect in an AF system, which is protected by the topological Chern number. By regulating the AF exchange field and an electric field, the system can be controlled between the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phases and the quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) phases. As a result, a QAHI/QSHI/QAHI junction can be formed. In the QAHI region, the spin orientation of chiral edge state can be manipulated by tuning the AF exchange field and the electric field. Therefore, the spin directions of two QAHIs in the junction can have parallel and antiparallel configurations. The conductances of two configurations offered by chiral edge states are significantly different, and this is a magnetoresistance effect that can be electrically controlled. Because of the topological invariance, the magnetoresistance plateaus are robust to the size effect and the disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lizhou Liu, Cheng-Ming Miao, Qing-Feng Sun, Ying-Tao Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the energy band structure and energy levels of graphene with staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman fields. Our study demonstrates that staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling induces bulk band crossover at the the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys and generates antihelical edge states at the zigzag boundaries, resulting in topological metallic phases. Quantized transport coefficients confirm the existence of these antihelical edge states. Furthermore, an in-plane Zeeman field, regardless of orientation, opens a gap in the antihelical edge states while preserving bulk band closure, leading to higher-order topological metals with corner states. We also validate the presence of these corner states in nanoflakes with zigzag boundaries and confirm the metallic phases with crossed bands through a continuum low-energy model analysis.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism-Induced Parity Anomaly in Weak Topological Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hao Wan, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that introducing altermagnetism on the surface of a weak topological insulator (TI) results in the emergence of a single massless Dirac fermion, exhibiting a parity anomaly. To explore the transport properties induced by this parity anomaly, we propose an effective two-dimensional (2D) lattice model to describe the weak TI surface. This model captures both the energy spectrum and spin texture of the weak TI surface while reducing computational complexity. We show that the weak TI surface hosts a half-integer chiral edge current under the influence of altermagnetism. Additionally, in the presence of decoherence, the Hall conductance attains a half-quantized value. Layer-resolved calculations from a 3D slab model further confirm that surface altermagnetism drives the surface Hall conductance to transition to $e^{2}/2h$, aligning with calculation from the 2D effective lattice model. Our findings establish a link between altermagnetism and quantum anomalies, positioning weak TIs as a potential platform for investigating the parity anomaly without a net magnetic moment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Fei Sun, Yue Mao, Yu-Chen Zhuang, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>As an unconventional magnet, altermagnetism attracts great interest in condensed matter physics and applies a new research platform for the spintronics. Since the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect is an important research aspect in spintronics, we theoretically propose a universal altermagnetic sandwich device to achieve the TMR effect and investigate its transport properties. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method and the Landauer-Büttiker formula, we obtain the conductance and the TMR ratio. By systematically rotating the orientations of the altermagnet and spin, we investigate how the altermagnetic orientations affect the conductance and the TMR ratio, and comprehensively demonstrate the dependence of the conductance and the TMR ratio on a range of parameters in the system. By tuning the altermagnetism strength and the Fermi energy, as well as rotating the orientations in the altermagnet, the TMR ratio can reach a value of over 1000%. In addition, we analyze the detailed symmetry relations of the conductance and the TMR ratio in our system. Our approach provides a new design concept for the next-generation information technologies based on the altermagnetic platform, paving the way for the development of spintronics applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Tao Lu, Qing-Feng Sun, Yun-Fang Li, Hong-Yu Tian</p>
            <p>Based on the tight-binding formalism, we study the effect of side potential on the spin and valley related electronic property of $2$D honeycomb lattices with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, such as silicene and germanene. The side potential is composed of potential field and exchange field applied on the boundaries of the zigzag nanoribbon. It is found that the side potential could greatly affect the helical edge states with different spin indices and the spin and valley are locked to each other. By adjusting the side potential and ribbon width, the system shows quantum spin-valley Hall effect, valley polarized quantum spin Hall effect, and spin polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect. Due to the side potential and the coupling of edge states in narrow ribbon, a band gap could be opened for specific spin and the time-reversal symmetry could be broken, leading to a spin polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase. Various kinds of spin-valley polarized edge states are formed at the two boundaries. Furthermore, the spin-valley polarized insulating states can be used to realize a perfect spin-valley switch.</p>

            <h2>Physically Interpretable Descriptors Drive the Materials Design of Metal Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage</h2>

            <p>Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.</p>

            <p>The subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling, exchange interactions, and cation ordering can lead to exotic magnetic states in transition-metal ions. We report a comprehensive study of the Re-based (5$d^1$) ordered double perovskite oxide Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD reveals that Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ crystallizes in the monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) at low temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate a transition below $\sim$13 K, with $M$--$H$ loops showing ferromagnetic-like hysteresis and an unusually high coercive field of 23 kOe at 2 K. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements detect static and spatially disordered internal fields below $T_M \simeq $ 12 K, consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic ground state determined by detailed DFT and force-theorem in Hubbard-I calculations. The reduced high-temperature effective moment ($\sim0.76~\mu_B$) and very small static moment ($\lesssim 0.222~\mu_B$) derived from $\mu$SR analysis and local-field simulations indicate a decisive role of spin-orbit coupling. Through a combined experimental and computational approach we unambiguously determine the canted antiferromagnetic order in Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$, showing that a very small ordered moment coexists with an exceptionally large coercivity. These results underscore the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and orbital ordering, providing new insights into magnetism in 5$d^1$ double perovskites.</p>

            <p>Kitaev magnets have emerged as pivotal systems for investigating frustrated magnetism, providing a unique platform to explore quantum phases governed by the interplay between bond-dependent anisotropy and external magnetic fields. However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site cluster. By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $\Gamma$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.</p>
