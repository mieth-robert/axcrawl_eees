            <h2>Aharonov-Bohm Interference in Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehyun Kim, Himanshu Dev, Amit Shaer, Ravi Kumar, Alexey Ilin, André Haug, Shelly Iskoz, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, David F. Mross, Ady Stern, Yuval Ronen</p>
            <p>Position exchange of non-Abelian anyons affects the quantum state of their system in a topologically-protected way. Their expected manifestations in even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems offer the opportunity to directly study their unique statistical properties in interference experiments. In this work, we present the observation of coherent Aharonov-Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures by employing the Fabry-Pérot interferometry (FPI) technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, $\Delta\Phi=2\Phi_0$, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of $\Delta\Phi=4\Phi_0$ may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge $e^* = \frac{1}{2}e$ or that interference of $e^* = \frac{1}{4}e$ quasiparticles is thermally smeared. Interestingly, at two hole-conjugate states, we also observe oscillation periods of half the expected value, indicating interference of $e^* = \frac{2}{3}e$ quasiparticles instead of $e^* = \frac{1}{3}e$. To probe statistical phase contributions, we operated the FPI with controlled deviations of the filling factor, thereby introducing fractional quasiparticles inside the interference loop. The resulting changes to the interference patterns at both half-filled states indicate that the additional bulk quasiparticles carry the fundamental charge $e^*=\frac{1}{4}e$, as expected for non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <h2>Chirality-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, flat bands and enhancement of superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Leonid Levitov, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Systems in which exchange interactions couple carrier spins to a spin texture with a net chirality exhibit a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, where the geometric gauge field and pseudo-magnetic field have opposite signs for carriers with opposite spins. As a result, Cooper pairs see a net zero vector potential and superconducting pairing is not hindered by pair-breaking effects. This allows superconductivity to occur even when the geometric field induces quantized Landau levels. We identify the dominant pairing order as an s-wave pair density wave of an FFLO type. Flat Landau levels can significantly enhance superconducting $T_c$, favoring superconductivity over competing orders. This exotic paired state features tell-tale signatures such as flat bands of Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles, manifest through Landau level-like resonances in the quasiparticle density of states.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Diode Effect in Double Quantum Dot Device</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Go Takeuchi, Mikio Eto</p>
            <p>Superconducting diode effect (SDE) is theoretically examined in double quantum dot coupled to three superconducting leads, $L$, $R1$ and $R2$. Lead $L$ is commonly connected to two quantum dots (QD1, QD2) while lead $R1$ ($R2$) is connected to QD1 (QD2) only. The phase differences $\varphi_{1}$ between leads $L$ and $R1$ and $\varphi_{2}$ between leads $L$ and $R2$ are tuned independently. The critical current into lead $R1$ depends on its direction unless $\varphi_{2} = 0$, $\pi$, which is ascribable to the formation of Andreev molecule between the QDs. In the absence of electron-electron interaction $U$ in the QDs, the spectrum of the Andreev bound states forms Dirac cones in the $\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}$ plane if the energy levels in the QDs are tuned to the Fermi level in the leads. The SDE is enhanced to almost 30\% when $\varphi_{2}$ is set to the value at the Dirac points. In the presence of $U$, the SDE is still observed when $U$ is smaller than the superconducting energy gap in the leads. Our device should be one of the minimal models for the SDE since a similar device with a single QD does not show the SDE.</p>

            <h2>Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajesh O. Sharma, Tanmoy Das</p>
            <p>Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for understanding many-body effects and interactions between systems and measurements. A key challenge is identifying appropriate states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating phase space as a manifold, we embed real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equation in the phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence in momentum space, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We then apply the model to a square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT) to unravel a coexistence of nodeless $s_{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.</p>

            <h2>An Addressable and Tunable Module for Donor-based Scalable Silicon Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihang Zhang, Yu He, Peihao Huang</p>
            <p>Donor-based spin qubit offers a promising silicon quantum computing route for building large-scale qubit arrays, attributed to its long coherence time and advancements in nanoscale donor placement. However, the state-of-the-art device designs face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit coupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a surface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable two-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single extra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the requirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is necessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly tunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit operation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning on and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design. Additionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations, allowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our proposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant, donor-based spin quantum processors.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Rashba-Edelstein THz emission modulation induced by ferroelectricity in CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2//LiNbO3 systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Massabeau, O. Paull, A. Pezo, F. Miljevic, M. Mičica, A. Grisard, P. Morfin, R. Lebrun, H. Jaffrès, S. Dhillon, J.-M. George, M. Jamet, M. Bibes</p>
            <p>Spintronic Terahertz emitters, based on optically triggered spin-to-charge interconversion processes, have recently emerged as novel route towards compact and efficient THz sources. Yet, the next challenge for further technologically-relevant devices remains to modulate the emission, with low-energy consumption operation. To this aim, ferroelectric materials coupled to active spin-orbit layers such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are suitable candidates. In this work, we present the realization of a large area heterostructure of CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2 on a bi-domain LiNbO3 substrate. Using THz time-domain spectroscopy, we show that the ferroelectric polarization direction induces a sizeable modulation of the THz emission. We rationalise these experimental results by using band structure and spin accumulation calculations that are consistent with an interfacial spin-to-charge conversion mediated by inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the MoSe2/PtSe2 interface and being tuned by ferroelectricity in the adjacent LiNbO3 surface. This work points out the relevance of field effect spin-orbit architectures for novel THz technologies.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism Induced Topological Phase Transitions in Kane-Mele Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengtian Li, Zeyu Li, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>We theoretically demonstrate that Chern number tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and second-order topological insulators can be induced in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator (TI), i.e., Kane-Mele model, by applying $d$-wave altermagnetism. When the Néel vector of altermagentism lies in the $x-y$ plane, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TI is broken and driven into a second-order topological insulator phase, exhibiting the representative corner states at nanoflakes. When the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is further included, the second-order TI is further driven into the QAHE phase with various Chern numbers (e.g., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$ or $\pm3$). When the Néel vector is along $z$ direction, the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is necessary to break the mirror symmetry to allow a sequential emergence of second-order TI and QAHE along with the increase of altermagentism strength. We also observe the QAHE with mixed-chirality, i.e., there exist counter-propagating edge modes but net chiral current at the ribbon boundary. Our work shows that altermagnetism can play a crucial role in exploring a rich variety of topological phases, just like its counterparts of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.</p>

            <h2>An ab-initio study on engineering quantum anomalous Hall effect in compensated antiferromagnet MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Li, Yulei Han, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has been theoretically proposed in compensated antiferromagnetic systems by using the magnetic topological insulator model [see arXiv:2404.13305 (2024)]. However, the related and systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As the only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator, MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological states. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator model, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the physical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external hydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the dramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological nontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of pressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$ heterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations with QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable strategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Transport in Interacting Spin Chains: Exact Derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto</p>
            <p>We theoretically study quantum spin transport in a one-dimensional folded XXZ model with an alternating domain-wall initial state via the Bethe ansatz technique, exactly demonstrating that a probability distribution of finding a left-most up-spin with an appropriate scaling variable converges to the Tracy-Widom distribution for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which is a universal distribution for the largest eigenvalue of GUE under a soft-edge scaling limit. Our finding presented here offers a first exact derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution in the dynamics of the interacting quantum model not being mapped to a noninteracting fermion Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. On the basis of the exact solution of the folded XXZ model and our numerical analysis of the XXZ model, we discuss a universal behavior for the probability of finding the left-most up-spin in the XXZ model.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Hofstadter cascade in a twisted semiconductor homobilayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin A. Foutty, Aidan P. Reddy, Carlos R. Kometter, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Trithep Devakul, Benjamin E. Feldman</p>
            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide moiré homobilayers have emerged as a platform in which magnetism, strong correlations, and topology are intertwined. In a large magnetic field, the energetic alignment of states with different spin in these systems is dictated by both strong Zeeman splitting and the structure of the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum, yet the latter has been difficult to probe experimentally. Here we conduct local thermodynamic measurements of twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers that reveal a cascade of magnetic phase transitions. We understand these transitions as the filling of individual Hofstadter subbands, allowing us to extract the structure and connectivity of the Hofstadter spectrum of a single spin. The onset of magnetic transitions is independent of twist angle, indicating that the exchange interactions of the component layers are only weakly modified by the moiré potential. In contrast, the magnetic transitions are associated with stark changes in the insulating states at commensurate filling. Our work achieves a spin-resolved measurement of Hofstadter's butterfly despite overlapping states, and it disentangles the role of material and moiré effects on the nature of the correlated ground states.</p>

            <h2>Designing Spin-driven Multiferroics in Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ranquan Cao, Ruizhi Dong, Ruixiang Fei, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>Spin-driven multiferroics exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling, with notable polarization changes under a magnetic field, but these effects are usually limited to high-Z magnetic insulators with low electronic polarization. In this work, we introduce altermagnets as a promising platform for achieving strong magnetoelectric coupling in low-Z systems with substantial polarization. This large polarization arises from a design principle that utilizes the Heisenberg-like exchange striction mechanism, eliminating the reliance on spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This approach enables the Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic phase derived from altermagnetic insulators to achieve substantial polarization without spin splitting, providing a flexible platform for regulating spin-splitting phenomena. Through first-principles simulations and an effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that materials in the LiMnO2 family and strained RuF4 family can achieve polarization values exceeding 1.0 {\mu}C/cm2, an order of magnitude larger than those found in SOC-driven multiferroics. Moreover, their magnetoelectric coupling is one to two orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in conventional multiferroics and those driven by SOC.</p>

            <h2>Chemical Compositions of Soot Samples in Gold Electrode Capacitors: Molecular Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda A. Andreeva</p>
            <p>Electrical breakdown in a dielectric capacitor occurs when the electric field strength across the dielectric material exceeds its breakdown strength. A conductive channel through the dielectric emerges, resulting in a sudden surge of current. Self-healing represents a phenomenon of restoration of a capacitor's performance. The efficiency of self-healing depends on the products of high-temperature decomposition of the electrode and dielectric. We report atomistic simulations of the soot's chemical composition in the case of gold electrodes and four popular dielectric polymers: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI). We unravel that gold atoms form clusters within the carbon-rich soot, limiting their interactions with non-metal elements. The oxygen atoms of PET, PC, and PI act as stabilizers of gold thanks to electrostatic attraction. Compared to zinc, gold equalizes the soot conductivity in all samples but does not impact polymer gasification. The suitability of dielectrics for self-healing must be rated based on the volatile by-products: PP > PC > PET > PI. Mind that PP issues three times more gases than PI. Therefore, the size of semiconducting soot is substantially smaller in the case of PP than in the case of PI. The obtained numerical results provide unprecedented physical insights into the phenomenon of self-healing and clearly drive the efforts to extend the lifespans of the metalized film capacitors.</p>

            <h2>A Universal Method to Transform Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules into Confined Carbyne inside Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingzhi Chen, Kunpeng Tang, Wendi Zhang, Huiju Cao, Hongwei Zhang, Yanghao Feng, Weili Cui, Yuan Hu, Lei Shi, Guowei Yang</p>
            <p>Carbyne, a sp1-hybridized allotrope of carbon, is a linear carbon chain with exceptional theoretically predicted properties that surpass those of sp2-hybridized graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the existence of carbyne has been debated due to its instability caused by Peierls distortion, which limits its practical development. The only successful synthesis of carbyne has been achieved inside CNTs, resulting in a form known as confined carbyne (CC). However, CC can only be synthesized inside multi-walled CNTs, limiting its property-tuning capabilities to the inner tubes of the CNTs. Here, we present a universal method for synthesizing CC inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm. Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are filled inside SWCNTs and subsequently transformed into CC under low-temperature annealing. A variety of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are confirmed as effective precursors for formation of CC, with Raman frequencies centered around 1861 cm-1. Enriched (6,5) and (7,6) SWCNTs with diameters less than 0.8 nm are less effective than the SWCNTs with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm for CC formation. Furthermore, resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that optical band gap of the CC at 1861 cm-1 is 2.353 eV, which is consistent with the result obtained using a linear relationship between the Raman signal and optical band gap. This newly developed approach provides a versatile route for synthesizing CC from various precursor molecules inside diverse templates, which is not limited to SWCNTs but could extend to any templates with appropriate size, including molecular sieves, zeolites, boron nitride nanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Insulator and Electrode Materials Marginally Influence Carbonized Layer Conductivity in Metalized-Film Capacitors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda Andreeva</p>
            <p>Capacitor self-healing is a generalized term to describe physical and chemical processes restoring the functionalities of a dielectric capacitor after an electrical breakdown. The efficacy of self-healing depends on the elemental composition of a metalized-film capacitor. We report atomistic simulations of self-healing from a chemical perspective proving the impossibility of tuning the electrical conductivity of the soot by finding an interplay of various polymers and electrodes. All investigated soot samples turn out to possess carbon-rich semiconducting skeletons with numerous unsaturated C-C covalent bonds. They exhibit electrical conductivities of the same order of magnitude, irrespective of initial chemical compositions and properties of the chosen insulating polymers. Upon reporting the new results, we discuss less evident approaches to diminish the soot conductivity. We conclude that the quality of capacitor self-healing can be assessed by counting gaseous by-products of electrical breakdown or evaluating the volume of the solid-state semiconducting counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning the Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals with neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han-Qing Shi, Hai-Qing Zhang</p>
            <p>Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: one is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.</p>

            <h2>Efficient inverted HTL-free Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$-based perovskite solar cell: a SCAPS-1D study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nassim Mahammedi</p>
            <p>The transition to sustainable energy has accelerated research into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaics. Despite their remarkable efficiencies, the commercialization of PSCs is hindered by lead toxicity and material instability. In this study, we explore a lead-free Samarium-based double perovskite oxide Sm$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (SNMO), as the active absorber layer in an innovative inverted HTL-free PSC architecture. Using SCAPS-1D simulations, we optimized the device configuration to achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.93% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.8 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 16.46 mA/cm2, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.14%. We demonstrate that increasing the SNMO absorber thickness enhances light harvesting in the red spectrum region (~620 nm), shifting the external quantum efficiency (EQE) peak from 380 nm at 50 nm thickness to about 620 nm at 1 um. We also investigated various electron transport layers (ETLs) and found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) exhibited superior PV performances, boosting the PCE to ~12.6% due to its excellent conductivity and optimal energy band alignment with SNMO. These findings establish SNMO as a promising absorber material for environmentally friendly PSCs, paving the way for cheaper, simpler, scalable, and sustainable photovoltaic solutions. This work highlights the potential of HTL-free architectures in reducing costs and complexities while maintaining competitive efficiencies, offering a significant step forward in advancing lead-free solar technologies.</p>

            <p>A two-dimensional second-order topological insulator exhibits topologically protected zero-energy states at its corners. In the literature, the breathing kagome lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping is often mentioned as an example of a two-dimensional second-order topological insulator. Here we show by explicit construction that the corner states of the breathing kagome lattice can be removed by a continuous change of the hopping parameters, without breaking any of the model's symmetries, without closing bulk and boundary gaps, and without introducing hopping terms not present in the original model. Furthermore, we topologically classify all three-band lattice models with the same crystalline symmetries as the breathing kagome lattice and show that though none of the phases have protected zero-energy corner states, some of the phases are obstructed atomic limits which exhibit a filling anomaly.</p>

            <p>Determining the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an essential step towards uncovering their superconducting mechanism. It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Under external stimuli, lead halide perovskites exhibit large atomic fluctuations, impacting optical and electron transport properties that affect device performance in operational settings. However, a thorough understanding of the atomic basis for the underlying structural instability is still absent. Focusing on the model material CsPbBr$_3$, the inherent lattice softness of halide perovskites is elucidated at the atomic level through in-situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements under pressure complemented by atomic level simulations. We identify and explore the nature of the first-order phase transition to a distorted P21/c phase at 1.3 GPa, induced by the sudden Cs-Br bonds breaking. Unlike classical transition metal oxide perovskites, where the internal energy term dominates, we show explicitly that pressure primarily influences the Gibbs free energy for halide perovskites through the pressure-volume term. As such, strategically mitigating bond strains from volume shrinkage is the key to suppressing the first-order behavior for maintaining the coordinates of PbX$_6$ polyhedral upon external perturbation. Our thermodynamic calculation reveals the demand for high entropy in the -T*del-S term, which can be achieved by exploring a broader spectrum of doped A site and B sites in ABX$_3$ systems, enabling continuous structural changes that facilitate recovery from mechanical damage in practical applications.</p>

            <p>Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina Sanino, Isaac Carvalho, Vivian França</p>
            <p>We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</p>

            <p>An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</p>

            <h2>Mott and Wiedemann Franz Law for Monolayer Graphene for Different Scattering Mechanisms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Purnendu Ray, Kingshuk Sarkar</p>
            <p>In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of the thermoelectric responses exhibited by monolayer pristine graphene in response to temperature variations. Employing the Boltzmann transport theory, we rigorously examined and evaluated various thermoelectric coefficients, with particular emphasis on elucidating their behavior under different scattering mechanisms. We derived the analytical expressions for electrical conductivity, thermopower, and thermal conductivity at low temperatures by Sommerfeld expansion of the Fermi integral. We demonstrated that our numerically obtained values are consistent with the analytical calculations at low temperatures and hence obeying Mott and Wiedeman Franz law. However, the deviation was observed at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we performed theoretical calculations of chemical potential at both low and high temperatures and compared them with our numerically evaluated results at all temperatures. Through extensive calculations and meticulous evaluation, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate thermoelectric properties inherent in monolayer pristine graphene.</p>

            <p>We use Brownian dynamics simulations and theory to study the over-damped spatiotemporal dynamics and pattern formation in a fluid-permeated array of equally spaced, active, elastic filaments that are pinned at one end and free at the other. The filaments are modeled as connected colloidal chains with activity incorporated via compressive follower forces acting along the filament backbone. The length of the chains is smaller than the thermal persistence length. For a range of filament separation and activity values, we find that the filament array eventually self-assembles into a series of regularly spaced, kinetically arrested, compact clusters. Filament activity, geometry, elasticity, and grafting density are each seen to crucially influence the size, shape, and spacing of emergent clusters. Furthermore, cluster shapes for different grafting densities can be rescaled into self-similar forms with activity-dependent scaling exponents. We derive theoretical expressions that relate the number of filaments in a cluster and the spacing between clusters, to filament activity, filament elasticity, and grafting density. Our results provide insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the initiation of clustering and suggest that steric contact forces and friction balance active forces and filament elasticity to stabilize the clusters. Our simulations suggest design principles to realize filament-based clusters and similar self-assembling biomimetic materials using active colloids or synthetic microtubule-motor systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</p>

            <p>In the present investigation, the chemical leaching of the poly-grain Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloy have been studied. The polished surfaces of as-cast alloys were leached with 10 mole NaOH solution for 0.5- 8 hours. The x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques have been used for structural and microstructural characterization. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis has been carried out for chemical composition analysis. Chemical leaching exclusively removes the Al from the surfaces of the Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloys, consequently by the formation of porous structure containing nano size particles of Cu, Co and their oxides have been observed. Al65Cu15Co20 exhibits high porosity in comparison to Al65Cu20Co15 alloy, however the size of the precipitated nano-particles i.e. Cu, Co, Cu2O and CuO were smaller in the case of Al65Cu20Co15 alloy. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis mapping suggests homogeneous distribution of Cu and Co found on the leached surface and the presence of oxygen was also detected.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frédéric Paquin-Lefebvre, Alejandro Barea Moreno, David Holcman</p>
            <p>Characterizing the local voltage distribution within nanophysiological domains, driven by ionic currents through membrane channels, is crucial for studying cellular activity in modern biophysics, yet it presents significant experimental and theoretical challenges. Theoretically, the complexity arises from the difficulty of solving electro-diffusion equations in three-dimensional domains. Currently, there are no methods available for obtaining asymptotic computations or approximated solutions of nonlinear equations, and numerically, it is challenging to explore solutions across both small and large spatial scales. In this work, we develop a method to solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with ionic currents entering and exiting through two narrow, circular window channels located on the boundary. The inflow through the first window is composed of a single cation, while the outflow maintains a constant ionic density satisfying local electro-neutrality conditions. Employing regular expansions and Green's function representations, we derive the ionic profiles and voltage drops in both small and large charge regimes. We explore how local surface curvature and window channels size influence voltage dynamics and validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations, assessing the accuracy of our asymptotic computations. These novel relationships between current, voltage, concentrations and geometry can enhance the characterization of physiological behaviors of nanodomains.</p>

            <h2>Crossover of Critical Behavior in Dynamic Phase Transitions of Ferromagnetic Thin Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erol Vatansever, Mikel Quintana, Andreas Berger</p>
            <p>We investigate the crossover of critical behavior for the dynamic phase transition (DPT) in ferromagnetic thin films using Monte Carlo simulations of the kinetic Ising model, focusing on the scaling behavior of the dynamic order parameter under a time-dependent external magnetic field. Specifically, we study the transition of the critical behavior of such film systems from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as a function of the film thickness and the distance to the critical point, which enables dimensional crossover observations. Our results indicate that the effective critical exponents exhibit a clear transition in their scaling behavior, with thinner films showing 2D-like characteristics and thicker films displaying 3D-like behavior, for both the DPT and the thermodynamic phase transitions (TPT). Quantitatively, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior occurs at larger film thicknesses for the DPT compared to the TPT, suggesting that DPT and TPT are governed by distinctly different length scales and underlying surface effects. These findings are in agreement with experimental observations in ultrathin Co films, where dynamic and thermodynamic critical exponents were found to differ. Therefore, our study provides an in-depth explanation for critical phenomena in thin-film ferromagnets driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. By comparing the dimensional crossover properties of both TPT and DPT, we present a comprehensive understanding of how thin-film geometry and surface effects influence the scaling laws and critical behavior in nonequilibrium systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beomjoon Goh, Junwon Kim, Hongchul Choi, Ji Hoon Shim</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a non-equilibrium steady-state non-crossing approximation (NESS-NCA) impurity solver applicable to general impurity problems. The choice of the NCA as the impurity solver enables both a more accurate description of correlation effects with larger Coulomb interaction and scalability to multi-orbital systems. Based on this development, we investigate strongly correlated non-equilibrium states of a dissipative lattice system under constant electric fields. Both the electronic Coulomb interaction and the electric field are treated non-perturbatively using dynamical mean-field theory in its non-equilibrium steady-state form (NESS-DMFT) with the NESS-NCA impurity solver. We validate our implementation using a half-filled single-band Hubbard model attached to a fictitious free Fermion reservoir, which prevents temperature divergence. As a result, we identify metallic and insulating phases as functions of the electric field and the Coulomb interaction along with a phase coexistence region amid the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT). We find that the MIT driven by the electric field is qualitatively similar to the equilibrium MIT as a function of temperature, differing from results in previous studies using the iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver. Finally, we highlight the importance of the morphology of a correlated system under the influence of an electric field.</p>

The phonon coupling induces dephasing and broadens the absorption and emission line shapes, while the weakly coupled cavity mode leads to effective driving of the QD. To capture non-Markovian effects, we use non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion and its hierarchical extension the Hierarchy of Pure States to compute multitime correlation functions underlying absorption and resonance fluorescence spectra. We present numerical results for the absorption spectra at strong phonon coupling and finite temperature, as well as for resonance fluorescence spectra at varying phonon coupling strengths and temperatures, and analyse the visibility of the resonance fluorescence spectra to provide insights into how phonon coupling and thermal effects influence the spectral features.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Markus Kantner</p>
            <p>Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by the empirical pseudopotential method to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature and compare our results with previous work. This framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</p>

Our approach provides a precise, analytically tractable pathway for understanding the spontaneous formation of PDWs in higher dimensions and offers a natural mechanism for PDW formation in the absence of a Zeeman field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Liang, Zhenhua Yu</p>
            <p>How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In the relentless pursuit of advancing semiconductor technologies, the demand for atomic layer processes has given rise to innovative processes, which have already played a significant role in the continued miniaturization features. Among these, atomic layer etching (ALE) is gaining increasing attention, offering precise control over material removal at the atomic level. Despite some thermal ALE achieved sub-nm etching controllability, the currently practical ALE processes that involve plasmas steps often suffer from high etch rates due to the scarcity of highly synergistic ALE half-reactions. To overcome this limitation, we developed an ALE process of silicon dioxide (SiO2) on a silicon wafer using sequential pure sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas exposure and argon (Ar) plasma etching near room temperature, achieving a stable and consistent etching rate of approximately 1.4 Å/cycle. In this process, neither of the two half-cycle reactions alone produces etching effects, and etching only occurs when the two are repeated in sequence, which means a 100% synergy. The identification of temperature and plasma power windows further substantiates the high synergy of our ALE process. Moreover, detailed morphology characterization over multiple cycles reveals a directional etching effect. This study provides a reliable, reproducible, and highly controllable ALE process for SiO2 etching, which is promising for nanofabrication processes.</p>

            <p>When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning ratchet imbued with odd transport properties. In the adiabatic limit of a massive object, we derive the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body in a chiral active bath, with odd diffusion and odd mobility connected by an Einstein relation, and numerically explore the breakdown of these predictions beyond the adiabatic limit. We show that the irreversibility of a massive object increases as its symmetry decreases: a disk exhibits an effective equilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational temperatures, and a wedge is fully out of equilibrium. Conversely, this departure from equilibrium can be read in the universal far-field currents and density modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive analytically.</p>

The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force.

            <p>We explore, through a combination of x-ray diffraction and elastoresistivity measurements, the effect of disorder on the strain-tuned charge density wave and associated multicriticality in Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.026). We focus particularly on the behavior near the strain-tuned bicritical point that occurs in pristine ErTe$_3$ (x=0). Our study reveals that while Pd intercalation somewhat broadens the signatures of the CDW phase transitions, the line of first-order transitions at which the CDW reorients as a function of applied strain persists in the presence of disorder and still seemingly terminates at a critical point. The critical point occurs at a lower temperature and a lower strain compared to pristine ErTe$_3$. Similarly, the nematic elastoresistance of Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$, though suppressed in magnitude and broadened relative to that of ErTe$_3$, has a markedly more symmetric response around the critical point. These observations point to disorder driving a reduction in the system's electronic orthorhombicity even while the material remains irrevocably orthorhombic due to the presence of a glide plane in the crystal structure. Disorder, it would appear, reinforces the emergence of a "pseudo-tetragonal" electronic response in this fundamentally orthorhombic material.</p>

We use Luttinger-Tisza, classical mean-field, and random-phase approximation techniques to model the dispersive crystal field excitons. We find extended-ranged and sign-changing interactions, suggesting a coupling between conduction electrons and the local moments. We demonstrate that low-symmetry anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in contrast with higher-symmetry interactions enabled by Weyl fermions, play an important role in stabilizing the complex spin spiral ground state of NdAlSi.

            <p>Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been observed in an epitaxial L1$_1$-ordered CoPt/CuPt bilayer and attributed to spin-orbit torque (SOT) arising from the crystallographic $3m$ point group of the interface. Using a first-principles nonequilibrium Green's function formalism combined with the Anderson disorder model, we calculate the angular dependence of the SOT in a CoPt/CuPt bilayer and find that the magnitude of the $3m$ SOT is about 20% of the conventional dampinglike SOT. We further study the magnetization dynamics in perpendicularly magnetized films in the presence of $3m$ SOT and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, using the equations of motion for domain wall dynamics and micromagnetic simulations. We find that for systems with strong interfacial DMI characterized by the Néel character of domain walls, a very large current density is required to achieve deterministic switching because reorientation of the magnetization inside the domain wall is necessary to induce the switching asymmetry. For thicker films with relatively weak interfacial DMI and the Bloch character of domain walls the deterministic switching with much smaller currents is possible, which agrees with recent experimental findings.</p>

            <p>A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</p>

            <p>The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.</p>

While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Lorentz Transformation of the Energy Spectrum of the Equilibrium State of Massive Free Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruohan Xu, Tingzhang Shi, H. T. Quan</p>
            <p>In previous studies of relativistic thermodynamics, the temperature of a static system, as perceived by a moving observer, has traditionally been treated as a scalar. This assumption has also been extended to the research on the cosmic microwave background. However, the validity of this assumption is a consequence of the massless nature of photons. More generally, when an observer is in relative motion to a system, the thermal equilibrium state is characterized by a four-vector temperature. In this paper, we study the non-interacting massive Bosonic and Fermionic field systems. We derive the Lorentz transformation of the energy spectral density in the equilibrium state of these fields. In the massless limit for bosonic field, our results recover the transformation of black body radiation [G. W. Ford and R. F. O' Connell., Phys. Rev. E, 88, 044101(2013)], which corresponds to a scalar temperature with dipole anisotropy. For the massive fields, the moving equilibrium state cannot be characterized by a corresponding scalar temperature. This result shows the necessity of introducing four-vector temperature in relativistic thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Universality of Top Rank Statistics for Brownian Reshuffling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zdzislaw Burda, Mario Kieburg</p>
            <p>We study the dynamical aspects of the top rank statistics of particles, performing Brownian motions on a half-line, which are ranked by their distance from the origin. For this purpose, we introduce an observable that we call the overlap ratio $\Omega(t)$, whose average is the probability that a particle that is on the top-$n$ list at some time will also be on the top-$n$ list after time $t$. The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the top of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It is simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the average overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state that undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a reflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we show that for $N\rightarrow \infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple form $\langle \Omega(t)\rangle = {\rm erfc}(a \sqrt{t})$ for $n\gg 1$ with some scaling parameter $a>0$. This result is a very good approximation even for moderate sizes of the top-$n$ list such as $n=10$. Moreover, as we show, the overlap ratio exhibits universal behavior observed in many dynamical systems including geometric Brownian motion, Brownian motion with a position-dependent drift and a soft barrier on one side, the Bouchaud-Mézard wealth distribution model, and Kesten processes.</p>

            <h2>High-pressure growth effects on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide superconductors</h2>

            <p>High-pressure synthesis can be an effective method for improving the sample quality of materials as well as their superconducting properties. In this paper, the synthesis process of F- doped SmFeAsO has been optimized by preparing a series of bulk SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111) using the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method, considering various growth parameters like growth pressures (0-1 GPa) and heating time (0.5-2 h). Structural, microstructural, Raman spectroscopic, transport, and magnetic measurements are employed to comprehensively analyze these bulks and derive the conclusive findings. The parent SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 prepared by the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) has a transition temperature (Tc) of around 53-54 K, and the critical current density (Jc) of 103 A/cm2 at 5 K with a small amount of the impurity phases (SmOF and SmAs), consistent with previous reports. Interestingly, all bulks synthesized by HP-HTS have almost the same Tc and Jc as the parent sample. The optimal growth conditions are obtained as 900C, 1 hour, and 0.5 GPa with the sealed Ta-tube, which slightly improved the sample quality and the superconducting properties compared to other bulks grown by HP-HTS. Our study confirms that the existence of the impurity phases in the 1111 family is very robust and cannot be reduced by HP-HTS, leading to only a small variation in the observed superconducting properties of Sm1111 whether prepared by CSP or HP-HTS. This is the first comprehensive investigation of the high-pressure development of Sm1111, which shows distinct behaviour from other families of iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuotao Xie, Yu-Feng Song, Yuan-Yao He</p>
            <p>We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half-filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations, and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half-filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.J. Calderón, A. Camjayi, A. Datta, E. Bascones</p>
            <p>Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</p>

The connection of the trimeron arrangement with site-selective doping of magnetite is discussed. Calculations of the polaron hopping energy allow us to make one step forward toward understanding the complex interplay of polaronic and bandgap contributions to electronic properties of the magnetite.</p>

            <h2>Unsupervised Classification of Non-Hermitian Topological Phases under Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Long, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</p>
            <p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into fundamental science has opened new possibilities to address long-standing scientific challenges rooted in mathematical limitations. For example, topological invariants are used to characterize topology, but there is no universally applicable one. This limitation explains why, in the past decades-long classification of topological phases of matter -- mainly focused on Hermitian systems -- many phases initially classified ``trivial" were later identified as topological. Recently, the discovery of non-Hermitian band topology has spurred substantial efforts in non-Hermitian topological classification, including the development of new topological invariants. However, such classifications similarly risk overlooking key topological features. Here, without relying on any topological invariant, we develop an AI-based unsupervised classification of symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases. This algorithm distinguishes topological differences among non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with symmetries, and constructs, in an unsupervised manner, a topological periodic table for non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, it can account for the boundary effects, enabling the exploration of open-boundary effects on the topological phase diagram. These results introduce an unsupervised approach for classifying symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases without omission and provide valuable guidance for the development of theories and experiments.</p>

            <p>Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.</p>

            <p>Weinvestigate the topological phase transition of Kitaev spin liquid in an external magnetic field by calculating the Berry curvature and the Fubini-Study metric. Employing Jordan-Wigner transformation and effective perturbative theory to transform the Hamiltonian into fermionic quadratic form, the Berry curvature is calculated by choosing the effective magnetic field as the parameter, and we find that the xy-component of the Berry curvature has the same behavior around the critical lines with the phase diagram and the behavior of Berry curvature around the critical line will not be influenced by local perturbation, i.e. it has the robustness against the local perturbation. Especially, we relate the Berry curvature with the derivative of effective magnetic susceptibility which can be regarded as the signature of topological phase transition besides, we related the second nonlinear susceptibility with the non-Abelian Berry connection. Then we analytically calculate the generalized Berry curvature in the mixed state called mean Uhlmann curvature which can be related with the spectral function, the curves that mean Uhlmanncurvaturechangingtemperaturewithdifferentcouplingconstant reveal that it will have an extrema when adjust $J_x$ from $A$ phase to $B$ phase. At last we analytically calculate the quantum geometric tensor in the effective magnetic field space whose imaginary part is the Berry curvature and real part is the Fubini-Study metric, and we find that the zz-component of Fubini-Study metric and the phase diagram are highly correlated which will peak at the cross point of three phases, then the Fubini-Study metric is extended to the finite temperature with arising an additional term called Fisher-Rao metric caused by mixed state.</p>

            <h2>The global critical current effect of superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heng Wu, Yaojia Wang, Mazhar N. Ali</p>
            <p>Superconductivity has been investigated for over a century, but there are still open questions about what determines the critical current; the maximum current a superconductor can carry before switching to its normal state. For a given superconductor, the zero-field critical current is widely believed to be determined by its inherent properties and be related to its critical magnetic field. Here, by studying superconducting polycrystalline films, single crystal flakes, and layered heterostructures, we find that the critical current of a superconductor can vary with measurement configuration. It can be influenced, or even determined, by adjacent superconducting segments along the applied current trajectory, whereas the critical magnetic field and critical temperature remain unaffected. This global critical current effect both reveals the need to revisit fundamental theory describing superconductivity, as well as implies that superconductors can transfer critical current related properties to each other. We demonstrate this by designing and fabricating a simple superconducting structure that transferred a superconducting diode effect from one segment to another segment which could not manifest the effect on its own. This observation merits a reconsideration of contemporary superconducting circuit design, and developing a full understanding will lead to a new paradigm of superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>The spin-12 three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder is studied under open boundary condition (OBC) and cylinder boundary condition (CBC), using the density matrix renormalization group and matrix product state methods, respectively. Specifically, we calculate the energy density, entanglement entropy, and concurrence while discussing the effects of interleg interaction J2 and the alternating coupling parameter gamma on these quantities. It is found that the introduction of gamma can completely reverse the concurrence distribution between odd and even bonds. Under CBC, the generation of the interleg concurrence is inhibited when gamma=0, and the introduction of gamma can cause interleg concurrence between chains 1 and 3, in which the behavior is more complicated due to the competition between CBC and gamma. Additionally, we find that gamma induces two types of long-distance entanglement (LDE) in the system under OBC: intraleg LDE and inter-leg one. When the system size is sufficiently large, both types of LDE reach similar strength and stabilize at a constant value. The study indicates that the three-leg ladder makes it easier to generate LDE compared with the two-leg system. However, the generation of LDE is inhibited under CBC which the spin frustration exists. In addition, the calculated results of energy, entanglement entropy and concurrence all show that there are essential relations between these quantities and phase transitions of the system. Further, we predict a phase transition point near gamma=0.54 under OBC. The present study provides valuable insights into understanding the phase diagram of this class of systems.</p>

We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.</p>

            <p>The long sought cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen (cg-N) consisting of N-N single bonds has been synthesized by a simple route using sodium azide as a precursor at ambient conditions. The recrystallization process was designed to expose crystal faces with low activation energy that facilitates initiating the polymeric reaction at ambient conditions. The azide was considered as a precursor due to the low energy barrier in transforming double bonded N=N to single bonded cg-N. Raman spectrum measurements detected the emerging vibron peaks at 635 cm-1 for the polymerized sodium azide samples, demonstrating the formation of cg-N with N-N single bonds. Different from traditional high pressure technique and recently developed plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method, the route achieves the quantitative synthesis of cg-N at ambient conditions. The simple method to synthesize cg-N offers potential for further scale up production as well as practical applications of polymeric nitrogen based materials as high energy density materials.</p>

Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range.

In this work, the Mg(OH)2 layer with a thickness about 25 microns was directly formed on AZ91magnesium alloy by oxidizing in superheated water vapor. SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate.

Si atoms segregate to the misfit dislocations, with segregation to full dislocations being stronger. The interface diffusion is dominated by short-circuit diffusion along the misfit dislocations, creating a significant diffusion anisotropy. Diffusion of Al and Si atoms along the full misfit dislocations is faster than along the partial misfit dislocations. Due to the presence of the misfit dislocations, diffusion at the Al(110)/Si(001) interface studied here is faster than diffusion at the Al(111)/Si(111) interfaces investigated in our previous work.</p>

Our measurements unveil highly anisotropic magnetic excitations in momentum space. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis of various models that incorporate diverse symmetry-allowed magnetic interactions, we find the observed excitations are well captured by a model with a large bond-dependent Kitaev interaction. These results not only help to understand the intriguing properties of VI3, such as the pronounced anomalous thermal Hall effects and strong pressure/structure dependence of magnetism, but also open a new avenue for exploring Kitaev physics.</p>

            <p>Magnetic materials phase reconstruction from Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements has traditionally been achieved using longstanding methods such as off-axis holography (OAH) and the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE). Amidst the increase in access to processing power and the development of advanced algorithms, phase retrieval of nanoscale magnetic materials with higher fidelity and resolution, potentially down to the few nanometer limit, becomes possible. Specifically, reverse-mode automatic differentiation (RMAD) and the extended electron ptychography iterative engine (ePIE) are two methods that have been utilized for high confidence phase reconstructions using LTEM through-focal series imaging and Lorentz scanning TEM (Ltz-4D-STEM), respectively. This work evaluates phase retrieval using TIE, RMAD, and ePIE in simulations consisting of an array of Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) nanoscale islands. Extending beyond simulations, we demonstrate total phase reconstructions of a NiFe nanowire using OAH and RMAD in LTEM and ePIE in Ltz-4D-STEM experiments and determine the magnetization saturation through corroborations with micromagnetic simulations. Finally, we show how the total phase shift gradient can be utilized to observe and characterize the proximity effects emanating from neighboring magnetic island interactions and an isolated NiFe nanowire.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the high temperature superconductivity observed in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the spectroscopic evidences of strong electron correlations in this compound, we address the role of its multiorbital electron correlations by proposing a global phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. We find a Mott transition developing at half filling, and identify strong orbital selectivity when the system is at the physical electron count. The orbital selectivity is manifested in the formation of interlayer spin singlets between electrons in the $z^2$ orbitals. These features lead to a strong renormalization of the electronic band structure while sustaining a sizable splitting between the bonding and antibonding $z^2$ bands. The proposed orbital-selective correlations naturally explain a series of features as observed in the angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and optical conductivity measurements in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results provide a basis to understand both the normal state and the high temperature superconductivity of multilayer nickelates and thereby elucidate correlated superconductivity in general.</p>

Focusing on discrete nonlinear maps, we analyze how key measures of chaos -- the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, which quantify sensitivity to initial perturbations and the ballistic spread of information, respectively -- are reduced by stochastic resetting. We identify a critical resetting rate that induces a dynamical phase transition, characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, effectively arresting the spread of information. These theoretical predictions are validated and illustrated with numerical simulations of the celebrated logistic map and its lattice extension. Beyond discrete maps, our findings offer insights applicable to a broad class of extended classical interacting systems.</p>

Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect.

            <p>The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect arises from strong electron correlations in a quantising magnetic field, and features exotic emergent phenomena such as electron fractionalisation. Using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach with the combinatorial summation algorithm, we obtain results with controlled accuracy for the microscopic model of interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level. As the temperature is lowered, we study the development and emergence of the incompressible 1/3-filled FQH state. By analysing the long-time decay of the Green's function, we find spectral properties consistent with an energy gap near 1/3-filling, while at half-filling an anomalous power law scaling is observed for short-range interaction screening, indicative of a non-Fermi liquid metal.

            <h2>Enhanced coarsening of charge density waves induced by electron correlation: Machine-learning enabled large-scale dynamical simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Yang, Chen Cheng, Yunhao Fan, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
            <p>The phase ordering kinetics of emergent orders in correlated electron systems is a fundamental topic in non-equilibrium physics, yet it remains largely unexplored. The intricate interplay between quasiparticles and emergent order-parameter fields could lead to unusual coarsening dynamics that is beyond the standard theories. However, accurate treatment of both quasiparticles and collective degrees of freedom is a multi-scale challenge in dynamical simulations of correlated electrons. Here we leverage modern machine learning (ML) methods to achieve a linear-scaling algorithm for simulating the coarsening of charge density waves (CDWs), one of the fundamental symmetry breaking phases in functional electron materials. We demonstrate our approach on the square-lattice Hubbard-Holstein model and uncover an intriguing enhancement of CDW coarsening which is related to the screening of on-site potential by electron-electron interactions. Our study provides fresh insights into the role of electron correlations in non-equilibrium dynamics and underscores the promise of ML force-field approaches for advancing multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.</p>

            <p>Oxyhydrides are gaining attention for their diverse functionality. However, evaluating electron, ion, and phonon transport properties and comprehending their mechanism remains challenging due to the difficulty in oxyhydride synthesis involving the trade-off between achieving density sintering and preventing hydrogen evolution. High-temperature treatments, often required to reduce intergranular resistance, typically cause hydrogen evolution before sufficient sintering. Instead of a post-annealing process aiming for strong chemical connections between oxyhydride particles, this research demonstrates a novel synthesis technique that converts pre-sintered bulk oxides into oxyhydrides while preserving the dense state. The process employs a high-pressure diffusion control method, facilitating the co-diffusion of hydride and oxide ions.</p>

            <p>Wurtzite LaN (wz-LaN) is a semiconducting nitride with favorable piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, making it promising for applications in electronics. We use first-principles density functional theory with a hybrid functional to investigate several features that are key for its use in heterostructures. First, for the purposes of growing wz-LaN on a substrate or designing a heterostructure, we show that it can be lattice-matched with a number of cubic materials along their [111] axes. We also evaluate the bound charge at such interfaces, taking into account both the polarization discontinuity and the piezoelectric polarization due to pseudomorphic strain. Second, we investigate band alignments and assess the results for interfaces with zincblende-, rocksalt-, and perovskite-structure compounds, and with chemically similar wurtzite and rocksalt nitrides. Our results provide guidance for the development of electronic devices based on wz-LaN.</p>

            <p>Sr-doped nickelate, Nd1-xSrxNiO3 (NSNO), perovskite thin films and Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases are actively investigated because of their physical properties, such as the metal-insulator transition and superconductivity. However, achieving epitaxial growth of NSNO perovskite and RP phase films in a sputtering system is challenging compared to pulsed laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, due to the difficulty in stabilizing nickel oxidation states and minimizing structural defects. Here, we used an off-axis radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering to fabricate epitaxial NSNO perovskite and RP phase thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates, systematically controlling the growth temperatures. We investigated the thermal stability of the perovskite phase and the structural and electronic characteristics of the RP phase films. These findings provide valuable insights into the synthesis of nickelate RP phase films using RF magnetron sputtering, paving the way for scalable thin films fabrication technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengwei Zhao, Gang v. Chen</p>
            <p>The mutual feedback between quantum condensed matter and cold atom physics has been quite fruitful throughout history and continues to inspire ongoing research. Motivated by the recent activities on the quantum simulation of topological orders among the ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, we consider the possibility of searching for topological orders among the dipolar quantum magnets and polar molecules with a kagomé lattice geometry. Together with other quantum interactions such as the transverse field, the dipolar interaction endows the kagomé system with a similar structure as the Balents-Fisher-Girvin model and thus fosters the emergence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory to access the topological ordered phase and describe the spinon and vison excitations for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We explain the spectroscopic consequences for various quantum phases as well as the experimental detection. We further discuss the rare-earth kagomé magnets, ultracold polar molecules, and cluster Mott insulators for the physical realization.</p>

            <h2>Positional information trade-offs in boundary-driven reaction-diffusion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Berx, Prashant Singh, Karel Proesmans</p>
            <p>Individual components such as cells, particles, or agents within a larger system often require detailed understanding of their relative position to act accordingly, enabling the system as a whole to function in an organised and efficient manner. Through the concept of positional information, such components are able to specify their position in order to, e.g., create robust spatial patterns or coordinate specific functionality. Such complex behaviour generally occurs far from thermodynamic equilibrium and thus requires the dissipation of free energy to sustain functionality. We show that in boundary-driven simple exclusion systems with position-dependent Langmuir kinetics, non-trivial Pareto-optimal trade-offs exist between the positional information, rescaled entropy production rate and global reaction current. Phase transitions in the optimal protocols that tune the densities of the system boundaries emerge as a result, showing that distinct protocols are able to exchange global optimality similar to phase coexistence in liquid-gas phase transitions, and that increasing the positional information can lead to diminishing returns when considering increased dissipation.</p>

            <p>At the mesoscale, the avalanche-like plastic bursts are associated with statistical signatures, whose parameters are not always well defined. In this work, we performed large scale and realistic Dislocation Dynamics simulations of the deformation of fcc Cu in bulk systems under fixed strain rate. Our results show that the power law exponent is not impacted by the dislocation density nor the loading direction. However, dislocation density controls the scaling of the power law truncation in avalanche statistics and triggering stress at the origin of plastic events. The correlation between the activities of slip systems is highlighted. Our quantitative data can provide explanations for some experimental observations and help link the mesoscopic plasticity picture to larger-scale models.</p>

            <h2>Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Matrix Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arya Bangun, Oleh Melnyk, Benjamin März</p>
            <p>We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes in materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Considering dynamical scattering is fundamental in describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. In TEM, both the Bloch wave formulation and the multislice method are commonly employed to model the scattering process, but comparing these models directly is challenging. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which represents the transmission function in terms of the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method does not have a pure transmission function due to the entanglement between electron waves and the propagation function within the crystal. To address this, we propose a reformulation of the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as transmission matrix. This enables a direct comparison to the well-known scattering matrix, derived from the Bloch wave formulation, and analysis of their eigenstructures. We show theoretically that both matrices are equal, under the condition that the angles of the eigenvalues differ no more than modulo $2\pi n$ for integer $n$, and the eigenvectors of the transmission and scattering matrix are related in terms of a two-dimensional Fourier matrix. The characterization of both matrices in terms of physical parameters, such as total projected potentials, is also discussed, and we perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we show that the determinant of the transmission matrix can be used to estimate the mean inner potential.</p>

            <p>Anyons are low-dimensional quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics, hence interpolating between bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states and they are believed to enable topological quantum computing. One-dimensional (1D) anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here, we observe anyonic correlations, which emerge through the phenomenon of spin-charge separation, in a 1D strongly-interacting quantum gas. The required spin degree of freedom is provided by a mobile impurity, whose effective anyonic correlations are associated with an experimentally tunable statistical angle. These anyonic correlations are measured by monitoring the impurity momentum distribution, whose asymmetric feature demonstrates the transmutation of bosons via anyons to fermions. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we study the dynamical properties of the anyonic correlations via dynamical fermionization of the anyons. Our work opens up the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting.</p>

            <p>Quasi-one-dimensional magnets can host an ordered longitudinal spin-density wave state (LSDW) in magnetic field at low temperature, when longitudinal correlations are strengthened by Ising anisotropies. In the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet YbAlO3 this happens via Ising-like interchain interactions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of magnetization plateaux at 1/5 and 1/3 of the saturation value via thermal transport and magnetostriction measurements in YbAlO3. We present a phenomenological theory of the plateau states that describes them as islands of commensurability within an otherwise incommensurate LSDW phase and explains their relative positions within the LSDW phase and their relative extent in a magnetic field. Notably, the plateaux are stabilised by ferromagnetic interchain interactions in YbAlO3 and consistently are absent in other quasi-1D magnets such as BaCo2V2O8 with antiferromagnetic interchain interactions. We also report a sharp, step-like increase of the magnetostriction coefficient, indicating a phase transition of unknown origin in the high-field phase just below the saturation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alaska Subedi</p>
            <p>Layered nickelates are believed to exhibit superconductivity similar to that found in the cuprates. However, the precise crystal structure of the superconducting phase of the layered nickelates has not been fully clarified. Here, I use first principles calculations to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in the single-layer-trilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which is one member of the layered nickelates family that also shows signatures of superconductivity. I find a nearly dispersionless nondegenerate phonon branch in the parent $P4/mmm$ phase that is unstable along the Brillouin zone edge $M$ $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ $\rightarrow$ $A$ $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ at all investigated pressures up to 30 GPa. Calculations show additional doubly-degenerate instabilities along the edge $MA$ at lower pressures. I used group-theoretical analysis to identify the distinct low-symmetry distortions possible due to these instabilities and generated them using the eigenvectors of the unstable modes. Structural relaxations show that the lowest energy structures at 0 and 10 GPa involve condensation of both the nondegenerate and doubly-degenerate instabilities, which is in contrast to the experimental refinements that involve condensation of only the doubly-degenerate branch. I also find that structural distortions are energetically favorable at 20 GPa, contrary to the experiments that do not observe any distortions of the parent $P4/mmm$ structure at high pressures.</p>

            <p>The bulk phase of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) has long been a subject of extensive investigation due to their utility as coating materials, electrocatalysts, and diffusion barriers, attributed to their high conductivity and refractory properties. Downscaling TMNs into two-dimensional (2D) forms would provide valuable members to the existing 2D materials repertoire, with potential enhancements across various applications. Moreover, calculations have anticipated the emergence of uncommon physical phenomena in TMNs at the 2D limit. In this study, we use the atomic substitution approach to synthesize 2D W5N6 with tunable thicknesses from tens of nanometers down to 2.9 nm. The obtained flakes exhibit high crystallinity and smooth surfaces. Electrical measurements on 15 samples show an average electrical conductivity of 161.1 S/cm, which persists while thickness decreases from 45.6 nm to 2.9 nm. The observed weak gate tuning effect suggests the semimetallic nature of the synthesized 2D W5N6. Further investigation into the conversion mechanism elucidates the crucial role of chalcogen vacancies in the precursor for initiating the reaction and strain in propagating the conversion. Our work introduces a desired semimetallic crystal to the 2D material library with mechanistic insights for future design of the synthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Audrey A. Watkins, Osama R. Bilal</p>
            <p>Simple local interactions can cause primitive building blocks to self-assemble into complex and functional patterns. However, even for a small number of blocks, there exist a vast number of possible configurations that are plausible, stable, and with varying degree of order. The ability to dynamically shift between multi-stable patterns (i.e., reprogram the self-assembly) entails navigating an intractable search space, which remains a challenge. In this paper, we engineer the self-assembly of macroscopic magnetic particles to create metamaterials with dynamically reversible emergent phases. We utilize a boundary composed of magnetic hinges to confine free-floating magnetic disks into different stable assemblies. We exploit the non-destructive nature of the magnetic boundaries to create re-programmable two-dimensional metamaterials that morphs from crystalline to quasi-crystalline to disordered assembly using the same number of disks and boundary. Furthermore, we explore their utility to control the propagation of sound waves in an effectively undamped media with rich nonlinearities. Our findings can expand the metamaterials horizon into functional and tunable devices.</p>

            <p>Dynamic magnetic response in a trilayered structure with non-equivalent layers (ABA type) has been studied with Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis algorithm. In each layer, ferromagnetic (FM) nearest neighbour Ising interactions are present along with antiferromagnetic (AFM) nearest neighbour coupling across different layers. The system is studied under a harmonically oscillating external magnetic field. It is revealed that along with dynamic phase transition (DPT), compensation phenomenon emerges in this system under dynamic scenario too. This feature in dynamic case is unique for such trilayered systems only, in contrast to the bulk system reported earlier. The temporal behaviour of the magnetisation of each individual layer shows that different magnetic response of the non-equivalent layers results into such dynamic compensation phenomenon. The difference in response also results into warping of the dynamic hysteresis loops, under various external parameter values, such as amplitude of the oscillating field and temperature.</p>

            <h2>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haifeng Tang, Shreya Vardhan, Jinzhao Wang</p>
            <p>We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times. Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Soto Garcia, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are characterised by the universal scaling laws in the critical region surrounding the transitions. This universality is also manifested in the critical real-time dynamics through the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In recent experiments on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism has been used to probe the nature of quantum phase transitions. In this paper we analyze the caveats associated with this method and develop strategies to improve its accuracy. Focusing on two minimal models -- transverse-field Ising and three-state Potts -- we study the effect of boundary conditions, the location of the endpoints and some subtleties in the definition of the kink operators. In particular, we show that the critical scaling of the most intuitive types of kinks is extremely sensitive to the correct choice of endpoint, while more advanced types of kinks exhibit remarkably robust universal scaling. Furthermore, we show that when kinks are tracked over the entire chain, fixed boundary conditions improve the accuracy of the scaling. Surprisingly, the Kibble-Zurek critical scaling appears to be equally accurate whether the fixed boundary conditions are chosen to be symmetric or anti-symmetric. Finally, we show that the density of kinks extracted in the central part of long chains obeys the predicted universal scaling for all types of boundary conditions.</p>

We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</p>

            <p>We obtain the first analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-based diffusion models can generate highly creative images that lie far from their training data. But optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in a fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, equivariant local score (ELS) machine that, (3) without any training can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.90, 0.91, 0.94$ on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST). Our ELS machine reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic model of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches in different image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.75$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.</p>

            <p>Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-Ångström probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.</p>

We train a deep learning model to predict emittance growth from experimentally accessible Ronchigrams. Both simulation and experimental results show the model can capture the emittance variation with aberration coefficients accurately. We further demonstrate the model can act as a fast-executing function for the global optimization of the lens parameters. Our approach enables new ways to quickly quantify and automate aberration correction that takes advantage of the rapid measurements possible with high-speed electron cameras. In part II of the paper, we demonstrate how the emittance metric enables rapid online tuning of the aberration corrector using Bayesian optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ghader Najarbashi, Hassan Bahmani, Babak Tarighi</p>
            <p>We investigate thermal and nonthermal quantum correlations in the one dimensional spin 1 bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model. Using tools from quantum information theory such as generalized concurrence, negativity, and various measures of quantum, classical, and total correlations in bipartite states we demonstrate that these measures effectively identify quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at critical points. Our negativity analysis reveals nearly identical results at zero or very low temperatures. Importantly, we find that partial concurrence, defined with the reduced density matrix, detects more quantum critical points than total concurrence. Additionally, we argue that spin chains with an odd number of spins are more effective than those with an even number in identifying QPTs.</p>

            <h2>Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianing Li, Weiyao Ke</p>
            <p>Transport properties of cold and dense nucleon matter are important for both nuclear and astrophysics but are relatively less studied than those at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta>0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</p>

            <p>Investigating the dynamics of learning in machine learning algorithms is of paramount importance for understanding how and why an approach may be successful. The tools of physics and statistics provide a robust setting for such investigations. Here we apply concepts from random matrix theory to describe stochastic weight matrix dynamics, using the framework of Dyson Brownian motion. We derive the linear scaling rule between the learning rate (step size) and the batch size, and identify universal and non-universal aspects of weight matrix dynamics. We test our findings in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine and in a linear one-hidden-layer neural network.</p>

            <h2>Cascading from $\mathscr{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory to Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Adjoint QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric D'Hoker, Thomas T. Dumitrescu, Efrat Gerchkovitz, Emily Nardoni</p>
            <p>We argue that adjoint QCD in 3+1 dimensions, with any $SU(N)$ gauge group and two Weyl fermion flavors (i.e. one adjoint Dirac fermion), confines and spontaneously breaks its chiral symmetries via the condensation of a fermion bilinear. We flow to this theory from pure $\mathscr{N}=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with the same gauge group, by giving a SUSY-breaking mass $M$ to the scalars in the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ vector multiplet. This flow can be analyzed rigorously at small $M$, where it leads to a deconfined vacuum at the origin of the $\mathscr{N}=2$ Coulomb branch. The analysis can be extended to all $M$ using an Abelian dual description that arises from the $N$ multi-monopole points of the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ theory. At each such point, there are $N-1$ hypermultiplet Higgs fields $h_m^{i = 1, 2}$, which are $SU(2)_R$ doublets. We provide a detailed study of the phase diagram as a function of $M$, by analyzing the semi-classical phases of the dual using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. The result is a cascade of first-order phase transitions, along which the Higgs fields $h_m^i$ successively turn on, and which interpolates between the Coulomb branch at small $M$, where all $h_m^i = 0$, and a maximal Higgs branch, where all $h_m^i \neq 0$, at sufficiently large $M$. We show that this maximal Higgs branch precisely matches the confining and chiral symmetry breaking phase of two-flavor adjoint QCD, including its broken and unbroken symmetries, its massless spectrum, and the expected large-$N$ scaling of various observables. The spontaneous breaking pattern $SU(2)_R \to U(1)_R$, consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem, is ensured by an intricate alignment mechanism for the $h_m^i$ in the dual, and leads to a $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ sigma model of increasing radius along the cascade.</p>

            <h2>Universal hyper-scaling relations, power-law tails, and data analysis for strong anomalous diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Vollmer, Claudio Giberti, Jordan Orchard, Hannes Reinhard, Carlos Mejía-Monasterio, Lamberto Rondoni</p>
            <p>Strong anomalous diffusion is {often} characterized by a piecewise-linear spectrum of the moments of displacement. The spectrum is characterized by slopes $\xi$ and $\zeta$ for small and large moments, respectively, and by the critical moment $\alpha$ of the crossover. The exponents $\xi$ and $\zeta$ characterize the asymptotic scaling of the bulk and the tails of the probability distribution function of displacements, respectively. Here, we adopt asymptotic theory to match the behaviors at intermediate scales. The resulting constraint explains how distributions with algebraic tails imply strong anomalous diffusion, and it relates $\alpha$ to the corresponding power law. Our theory provides novel relations between exponents characterizing strong anomalous diffusion, and it yields explicit expressions for the leading-order corrections to the asymptotic power-law behavior of the moments of displacement. They provide the time scale that must be surpassed to clearly discriminate the leading-order power law from its sub-leading corrections. This insight allows us to point out sources of systematic errors in their numerical estimates. Rather than separately fitting an exponent for each moment we devise a robust scheme to determine $\xi$, $\zeta$ and $\alpha$. The findings are supported by numerical and analytical results on five different models exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Envelope presentation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Bin Chen</p>
            <p>Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</p>

This analysis provides insight into how SPPs are formed in time and how they interfere at a temporal boundary.</p>

            <h2>The Casimir Effect in (3+1)-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: the unexpected universality of quarkiton and glueton boundary states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim N. Chernodub, Vladimir A. Goy, Alexander V. Molochkov, Konstantin R. Pak, Alexey S. Tanashkin</p>
            <p>In our earlier work on the Casimir effect in (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we identified two novel nonperturbative states arising in QCD with boundaries: the glueton and the quarkiton. The glueton, or "gluon exciton", is a colorless bound state formed by gluons interacting with their negatively colored images in a chromometallic mirror. The quarkiton, or "quark exciton", is a meson-like state comprising a heavy quark attracted to its image through the mirror. In this study, we extend our analysis to finite temperatures near the deconfinement phase transition $(T \approx 0.78 T_c)$, where we observe a linear potential between a color-neutral chromometallic mirror and a heavy test quark. Our result suggests that the quarkiton state can have a physical relevance since mirrors for photons and, presumably, gluons can be realized in field theories as domain-wall solutions. Furthermore, we find a striking universality: the ratio of the glueton mass to the bulk $0^{++}$ glueball mass - defining the bulk mass gap - matches the ratio of the quarkiton string tension to the string tension between quark and anti-quark in the absence of the mirror, with a value $\mathcal{R} = 0.294(11)$.</p>

            <h2>Aging behavior of the scale-free network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuho Sekikawa, Hiroshi Watanabe</p>
            <p>The number of users on social media continues to increase during the growth phase. Still, eventually, the number of new users balances out the number of departing users, and the number of users becomes almost constant. To investigate how network properties change under these conditions, we study the aging behavior of the network. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab'asi model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We defined $\alpha$ as the node deletion parameter and $\beta$ as the node addition parameter. The larger $\alpha$ yields, the higher the probability of deleting a node with a larger degree, and the larger $\beta$ yields, the higher the probability of connecting to a node with a larger degree and fitness. We found that the network cannot reach a steady state in some parameter regions. We investigated the degree distribution of the network that reached a steady state. The scale-free nature of the network broke down in regions where $\alpha$ is large and $\beta$ is small, and the degree distribution became exponential. We also performed percolation analyses. While the phase transition point was zero in the scale-free network, the phase transition point changed finitely in regions with large $\alpha$ and small $\beta$. The phase diagram of whether the degree distribution is power-law or exponential and whether the phase transition point of percolation is zero or finite exhibits a good agreement between the phase boundaries. This study is expected to help control network structure in mature networks.</p>

            <h2>Parametrized topological phases in 1d and T-duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Geiko</p>
            <p>There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space, even if each system in the family belongs to the trivial phase. The obstruction is measured by higher Berry class. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We use the generalized matrix-product states to describe RG fixed points of all translation invariant pure splits states on spin chains. Families of such fixed points correspond to bundles of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. There exists a global MPS parametrization of the family if and only if the latter bundle is trivial. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes. Mathematically, the T-duality is realized by gauging the circle action on the continuous trace algebra generated by parametrized matrix-product tensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>We study the surface code under the most general single-qubit $X$-error channel, encompassing both coherent and incoherent errors. We develop a statistical mechanics mapping for the decoding problem and represent the partition function as a transfer-matrix, i.e., a (1+1)$D$ hybrid quantum circuit. The relevant circuit evolution, as we show, has an efficient matrix product state approximation, using which we develop an algorithm for large-scale syndrome sampling, thus enabling the simulation of these non-Pauli errors away from the limits captured by previous methods. Using these results, we compute maximum-likelihood thresholds and show that error coherence has negligible influence away from the fully coherent limit. We also study how coherence impacts information-theoretic measures like the coherent information, which we show to require, for accurate threshold estimates, increasingly large codes upon increasing error coherence and to eventually break down in the fully coherent limit. To interpret the dominant effect of incoherent errors in large codes, we develop a phenomenological errorfield double field theory, which indicates the instability of coherent errors' above-threshold quasi-long-range order to the above-threshold disorder characteristic of bit-flip errors and the suppression of coherence in the logical noise channel.</p>

            <p>Any local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) has a corresponding "universal" relevant deformation that takes it to a gapped phase. This deformation preserves all continuous internal symmetries, $\mathcal{S}$, and therefore also preserves any 't Hooft anomalies supported purely in $\mathcal{S}$. We describe the resulting phase diagram in the case of SCFTs that arise as the endpoints of renormalization group flows from 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Abelian gauge theories with any number of $U(1)$ gauge group factors and arbitrary integer charges for the matter fields. We argue that the universal deformations take these QFTs to Abelian fractional quantum Hall states in the infrared (IR), and we explain how to match 't Hooft anomalies between the non-topological ultraviolet theories and the IR topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). Along the way, we give a proof that 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror symmetry of our Abelian gauge theories descends to a duality of these TQFTs. Finally, using our anomaly matching discussion, we describe how to connect, via the renormalization group, abstract local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs with certain 't Hooft anomalies for their internal symmetries to IR phases (partially) described by Abelian spin Chern-Simons theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Aldo Venturelli, Sreetama Das, Filippo Caruso</p>
            <p>Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) ideal for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, and is highly successful for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). It has been observed that the optimal variational parameters obtained from one instance of a COP can be transferred to another instance, producing sufficiently satisfactory solutions for the latter. In this context, a suitable method for further improving the solution is to fine-tune a subset of the transferred parameters. We numerically explore the role of optimizing individual QAOA layers in improving the approximate solution of the Max-Cut problem after parameter transfer. We also investigate the trade-off between a good approximation and the required optimization time when optimizing transferred QAOA parameters. These studies show that optimizing a subset of layers can be more effective at a lower time-cost compared to optimizing all layers.</p>

            <p>To make efficient use of limited physical resources, the brain must match its coding and computational strategies to the statistical structure of input signals. An attractive testing ground for these principles is the problem of motion estimation in the fly visual system: we understand the optics of the compound eye, have a quantitative description of input signals and noise from the retina, and can record from output neurons that encode estimates of different velocity components. Furthermore, recent work provides a nearly complete wiring diagram of the intervening circuitry. What is missing is a characterization of the visual signals and motions that flies encounter in a natural context. We attack this directly with the development of a specialized camera that matches the high temporal resolution, optical properties, and spectral sensitivity of the fly's eye; inertial motion sensors provide ground truth about rotations and translations through the world. We describe the design, construction, and performance characteristics of this FlEye camera. To illustrate the opportunities created by this instrument we use data on movies and motion to construct optimal local motion estimators that can be compared with the responses of the fly's motion sensitive neurons.</p>

By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</p>

            <p>We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity, in light of recent developments on the EFT of dissipative hydrodynamics (HydroEFT). Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. A key aspect of dynamical gravity is that gravity couples to all degrees of freedom universally, hence the EFT has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the environment to which the energy escapes from the dissipative system of interest. We incorporate this effect by modeling the environment based on HydroEFT, assuming validity of the derivative expansion of the environment sector. For illustration, we apply our EFT recipe to a dissipative scalar field coupled to dynamical gravity that can be used, e.g., for dissipative inflation. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions admits a finite non-invertible symmetry described mathematically by a fusion category. This symmetry is spontaneously broken at long distances, leading to distinct vacua. When the theory has a mass gap, the spectrum is therefore characterized by particle excitations above a single vacuum and soliton sectors interpolating between vacua. We use anyon condensation and the representation theory of fusion categories to obtain exact results about this spectrum, exhibiting the allowed multiplets. Often, particles and solitons are in the same representation and therefore must have equal masses. Furthermore, the fusion category symmetry frequently implies the existence of certain stable states in the spectrum. The resulting degeneracies are encoded in quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are excited states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rainer Engelken, Michael Monteforte, Fred Wolf</p>
            <p>Nerve impulses, the currency of information flow in the brain, are generated by an instability of the neuronal membrane potential dynamics. Neuronal circuits exhibit collective chaos that appears essential for learning, memory, sensory processing, and motor control. However, the factors controlling the nature and intensity of collective chaos in neuronal circuits are not well understood. Here we use computational ergodic theory to demonstrate that basic features of nerve impulse generation profoundly affect collective chaos in neuronal circuits. Numerically exact calculations of Lyapunov spectra, Kolmogorov-Sinai-entropy, and upper and lower bounds on attractor dimension show that changes in nerve impulse generation in individual neurons moderately impact information encoding rates but qualitatively transform phase space structure. Specifically, we find a drastic reduction in the number of unstable manifolds, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, and attractor dimension. Beyond a critical point, marked by the simultaneous breakdown of the diffusion approximation, a peak in the largest Lyapunov exponent, and a localization transition of the leading covariant Lyapunov vector, networks exhibit sparse chaos: prolonged periods of near stable dynamics interrupted by short bursts of intense chaos. Analysis of large, more realistically structured networks supports the generality of these findings. In cortical circuits, biophysical properties appear tuned to this regime of sparse chaos. Our results reveal a close link between fundamental aspects of single-neuron biophysics and the collective dynamics of cortical circuits, suggesting that nerve impulse generation mechanisms are adapted to enhance circuit controllability and information flow.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pinaki Banerjee, Bidisha Chakrabarty, Swapnamay Mondal</p>
            <p>When a system consists of a large subsystem (bath) and a small one (probe), thermalization implies induction of temperature of the bath onto the probe. If both the bath and the probe are described by same microscopic Hamiltonian, thermalization further entails that the probe imbibes the phase of the bath. We refer to this phenomenon as {\it phase thermalization}. However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is realizable when the probe and the bath are described by different microscopic Hamiltonians. We show {\it phase thermalization} is possible even when the microscopic Hamiltonians differ significantly. We provide an explicit example, where the probe is a Fermi liquid realized by a Majorana chain with $n \gg 1$ fermions per site interacting through random hopping and the bath is an incoherent metal described by another Majorana chain with $N > n$ fermions per site interacting through arbitrarily long range random four-fermion interaction. In deep infrared (\emph{i.e.} at very low energies), the probe turns into an incoherent metal, with Lyapunov spectrum and diffusion coefficient identical to the bath.</p>

            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.</p>

For decades, a myriad of polymer network models have been developed with differing numbers of chains, arranged in different ways, and with differing symmetries. To complicate matters further, there are also competing assumptions for how macroscopic variables (e.g. deformation) are related to individual chains within the network model. In this work, we propose a simple, intuitive assumption for how the network locally rotates relative to applied loading (e.g. stresses, external fields) and show that this assumption unifies many of the disparate polymer network models--while also recovering one of the most successful models for rubber elasticity, the Arruda-Boyce $8$-chain model. The new assumption is then shown to make more intuitive predictions (than prior models) for stimuli-responsive networks with orientational energies (e.g. electroactive polymers), which is significant for shape morphing and designing high degree of freedom actuators (e.g. for soft robotics). Lastly, we unveil some surprising consequences of the new model for the phases of multistable biopolymer and semi-crystalline networks.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Wigner-Mott transition at $\nu=1/5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas G. Kiely, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Electrons can organize themselves into charge-ordered states to minimize the effects of long-ranged Coulomb interactions. In the presence of a lattice, commensurability constraints lead to the emergence of incompressible Wigner-Mott insulators at various rational electron fillings, $\nu~=p/q$. The mechanism for quantum fluctuation-mediated melting of the Mott insulators with increasing electron kinetic energy remains an outstanding problem. Here, using matrix product state techniques, we analyze the bandwidth-tuned transition out of the Wigner-Mott insulator at $\nu=1/5$ in an extended Hubbard model on infinite cylinders of varying circumference. For the two-leg ladder, the transition from the Mott insulator to the Luttinger liquid proceeds via a distinct intermediate phase with gapless Cooper-pairs and gapped electronic excitations. The resulting Luther-Emery liquid is the analog of a strongly fluctuating superconductor. We place these results in the context of a low-energy bosonization based theory for the transition. On the five-leg cylinder, we provide numerical evidence for a direct continuous transition between the Wigner-Mott insulator and a metallic phase across which the spin and charge-gaps vanish simultaneously. We comment on the connections to ongoing experiments in dual-gated bilayer moiré transition metal dichalcogenide materials.</p>

            <h2>Collective epithelial migration mediated by the unbinding of hexatic defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Krommydas, Livio Nicola Carenza, Luca Giomi</p>
            <p>Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: a local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to swap their positions. Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity in single-layer graphene has attracted considerable interest. Here, using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study transitions of superconductivity and magnetism in a monolayer graphene with a special periodic strain. Consistent with experiments, the deformation accumulates a series of flat bands, whose robustness under interaction is verified through electron localization in real space. During the reconstruction of the band structure, the superconductivity appears in flat band range with next-nearest neighbor $d+id$ pairing symmetry dominating other modes and is accompanied by ferromagnetism caused by symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate that the strain-induced symmetry breaking would accumulate an energy-gap antiferromagnetic insulating phase at half filling even under the limitation of not strong enough interaction, which shows its potential as a platform that exhibits strongly correlated phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Wen Yu, Bang-Gui Liu</p>
            <p>2D materials can host interesting physics and have important applications in various fields. Recent experiment shows that monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoflakes with neutral zigzag edges are stable. Here, we study semiconducting stoichiometric PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons with the stable neutral zigzag edges (with $N$ describing different nanoribbon width) through combining detailed first-principles investigation with low-energy model analysis. Our careful analysis of first-principles conduction and valence bands (with the spin-orbits coupling taken into account) indicates that the low-energy bands assume relativistic energy dispersion in an energy window of [-0.2 eV, 0.2eV] (at least) and have large unconventional Rashba spin splitting (for even $N$). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the low-energy bands can be well described by an effective one-dimensional electron model and the semiconductor gap will remain finite even for large $N$. Most importantly, it is shown that there exists SU(2) spin symmetry in both of the conduction and valence bands for each edge, which implies persistent spin helices (in the spin xy plane) and spin-conserving carrier transport. When the inter-edge interaction becomes weak ($N$ is large enough), a nearly-perfect Dirac fermion system can be achieved through combining the valence and conduction bands. Thus we realize unconventional Rashba splitting, double SU(2) spin symmetry, persistent spin helices/textures, and pure Dirac fermion systems in stable monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Lovarelli, Fabrizio Mazziotti, Demetrio Logoteta, Giuseppe Iannaccone</p>
            <p>Reducing the contact resistance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional materials is one of the key improvements required to enable the integration of such transistors in an advanced semiconductor manufacturing process. Suitably designed lateral heterojunctions provide an opportunity to independently tailor the contact and channel properties in order to optimize contact resistance. Inspired by the recent experimental demonstration of a two-dimensional $p$-type Schottky barrier, here we use quantum transport simulations to estimate the performance of $p$-type transistors in which the channel consists of a lateral heterostructure of NbS$_2$/MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ (semimetal-semiconductor-semimetal). We find that the gate alignment with the channel is a critical design parameter, strongly influencing the capability of the gate to modulate the Schottky barrier at the MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ interface. This effect is also found to significantly affect the scaling behavior of the device.</p>

            <h2>Phase Switch Driven by the Hidden Half-Ice, Half-Fire State in a Ferrimagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiguo Yin, A. M. Tsvelik</p>
            <p>The notion of "half fire, half ice" was recently introduced to describe an exotic macroscopic ground-state degeneracy emerging in a ferrimagnet under the critical magnetic field, in which the "hot" spins are fully disordered on the sublattice with smaller magnetic moments and the "cold" spins are fully ordered on the sublattice with larger magnetic moments. Here we further point out that this state has a twin named "half ice, half fire" in which the hot and cold spins switch positions. The new state is an excited state -- thus hidden in the ground-state phase diagram -- and is robust with respect to the interactions that destroy the half fire, half ice state. We demonstrate with exact results how this hidden state can drive phase switching at desirable finite temperature, even for the one-dimensional Ising model where phase transition at finite temperature is forbidden. We suggest that our findings may open a new door to the understanding and controlling of phase competition and transition in unconventional frustrated systems.</p>

            <p>The kinetics of dislocation reactions, such as dislocation multiplication, controls the plastic deformation in crystals beyond their elastic limit, therefore critical mechanisms in a number of applications in materials science. We present a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that shows that one such type of reactions, the nucleation of dislocation at free surfaces, exhibit extremely unconventional kinetics, including unexpectedly large nucleation rates under compression, very strong entropic stabilization under tension, as well as strong non-Arrhenius behavior. These unusual kinetics are quantitatively rationalized using a variational transition state theory approach coupled with an efficient numerical scheme for the estimation of vibrational entropy changes. These results highlight the need for a variational treatment of the kinetics to quantitatively capture dislocation reaction kinetics, especially at low-to-moderate strains where large deformations are required to activate reactions. These observations suggest possible explanations to previously observed unconventional deformation kinetics in both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atri Goswami, Rohn Chatterjee, Sudip Mukherjee</p>
            <p>Totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) sets the paradigm for one-dimensional driven single file motion. We study a periodic TASEP with two ``road blocks'' or defects of different kinds, one point and another extended, across which particle flows are inhibited. We show how the interplay between particle number conservation and competition between the defects lead to inhomogeneous steady states with localised domain walls (LDW). The LDW locations jump discontinuously, indicating a discontinuous transition between these LDW states, as the system passes from being controlled by one defect to the other. When the defects are ``competing'', instead of an LDW a pair of delocalised domain walls appear, none of which can penetrate the extended defect. A minimum current principle can be used to identify the dominant defect that controls the domain wall formations. Our results should be important in diverse systems, ranging from protein synthesis by ribosomes in biological cells to urban traffic networks.</p>

            <h2>Universal energy-speed-accuracy trade-offs in driven nonequilibrium systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jérémie Klinger, Grant M. Rotskoff</p>
            <p>Physical systems driven away from equilibrium by an external controller dissipate heat to the environment; the excess entropy production in the thermal reservoir can be interpreted as a "cost" to transform the system in a finite time. The connection between measure theoretic optimal transport and dissipative nonequilibrium dynamics provides a language for quantifying this cost and has resulted in a collection of "thermodynamic speed limits", which argue that the minimum dissipation of a transformation between two probability distributions is directly proportional to the rate of driving. Thermodynamic speed limits rely on the assumption that the target probability distribution is perfectly realized, which is almost never the case in experiments or numerical simulations. Here, we address the ubiquitous situation in which the external controller is imperfect. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for the dissipated work in generic nonequilibrium control problems that 1) is asymptotically tight and 2) matches the thermodynamic speed limit in the case of optimal driving. We illustrate these bounds on analytically solvable examples and also develop a strategy for optimizing minimally dissipative protocols based on optimal transport flow matching, a generative machine learning technique. This latter approach ensures the scalability of both the theoretical and computational framework we put forth. Crucially, we demonstrate that we can compute the terms in our bound numerically using efficient algorithms from the computational optimal transport literature and that the protocols that we learn saturate the bound.</p>

            <h2>Numerical study of neutral and charged microgel suspensions: from single-particle to collective behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Del Monte, Emanuela Zaccarelli</p>
            <p>We perform extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of an ensemble of realistic microgel particles in swollen conditions in a wide range of packing fractions $\zeta$. We compare neutral and charged microgels, where we consider charges distribution adherent to experimental conditions. Through a detailed analysis of single-particle behavior, we are able to identify the different regimes occurring upon increasing concentration: from shrinking to deformation and interpenetration, always connecting our findings to available experimental observations. We then link these single-particle features to the collective behavior of the suspension, finding evidence of a structural reentrance, that has no counterpart in the dynamics. Hence, while the maximum of the radial distribution function displays a non-monotonic behavior with increasing $\zeta$, the dynamics, quantified by the microgels' mean-squared displacement, always slows down. This behavior, at odds with simple Hertzian model, can be described by a phenomenological multi-Hertzian, which takes into account the enhanced internal stiffness of the core. However, also this model fails when deformation enters into play, whereby more realistic many-body models are required. We are able to unveil the key physical mechanisms, shrinking and deformation, giving rise to the structural reentrance that holds up to very large packing fractions. We further identify key similarities and differences between neutral and charged microgels, for which we detect at high enough $\zeta$ the fusion of charged shells, previously invoked to explain key experimental findings, and responsible for the structural reentrance. Overall, our study establishes a powerful framework to uncover the physics of microgel suspensions, paving the way to tackle different regimes and internal structural architectures, where experimental evidence is still limited.</p>

In particular, the magnon spin current is dominated by electric field component which perpendicular to the magnetization direction. We apply our theory to 1D ferromagnetic SSH model and show that the generated magnon spin current is closely related to the band geometry. Our findings expands the horizons of magnonics and electric-control-magnon mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The anharmonic phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction to be approached, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p>Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</p>

            <p>The discovery of a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and its novel mechanism holds significant promise for advancing both fundamental research and practical applications. Magnetic kagome lattice materials are uniquely suited for studying the AHE due to their interplay between electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. However, the geometric frustration inherent in kagome lattices often limits the configuration and tunability of magnetic order. Here, we present a new design strategy for kagome-lattice materials with emergent magnetism, exemplified by the magnetic kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which features interwoven magnetic Tb zigzag chains and non-magnetic Ti kagome bilayers. This material exhibits a record-high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 10$^5$ $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$. Spectroscopy measurements reveal a large band folding gap observed via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, coexisting spin-density-wave (SDW) order detected through spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and a spiral magnetic order with large magnetic moments identified by neutron diffraction. These findings highlight a strong electron-magnetic coupling between itinerant charges and ordered magnetic moments, offering a spectroscopic explanation for the giant AHC in TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$. This work establishes a pathway for innovative material design strategies, unlocking new possibilities for future exploration and applications in quantum and spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>$\beta$-Tungsten ($\beta$-W), an A15 cubic phase of tungsten, exhibits a giant spin Hall angle compared to its bcc-phase $\alpha$-Tungsten ($\alpha$-W), making high-quality $\beta$-W films desirable for spintronic applications. We report the controlled growth of $\beta$-W films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates via DC sputtering, where substrate bias serves as a critical factor in stabilizing the $\beta$ phase by regulating the energy of deposited atoms. This approach enables the formation of $\beta$-W films over a wide thickness range. Additionally, we studied the spin pumping phenomena in different tungsten phases achieved through substrate bias. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements reveal an enhancement in the magnetic damping (\( \alpha_{\text{eff}} \)) for $\beta$-W/Py compared to $\alpha$-W/Py dominated film. The effective spin mixing conductance (\( g_{\text{eff}}^{\uparrow\downarrow} \)) is found to be higher in $\beta$-W/Py than in $\alpha$-W/Py, which is attributed to variations in the interface structures between these phases. Importantly, the use of substrate bias does not deteriorate the interface quality, underscoring its effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of substrate bias in thin-film engineering, paving the way for its advanced utilization in spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>The Holstein model on a square lattice at half-filling has a well-established finite temperature phase transition to an insulating state with long range charge density wave (CDW) order. Because this CDW formation suppresses pairing, a superconducting (SC) phase emerges only with doping. In this work, we study the effects of dilution of the local phonon degrees of freedom in the Holstein model while keeping the system at half filling. We find not only that the CDW remains present up to a dilution fraction $f \sim 0.15$, but also that long range pairing is stabilized with increasing $f$, resulting in a {\it supersolid} regime centered at $f \approx 0.10$, where long range diagonal and off-diagonal correlations coexist. Further dilution results in a purely SC phase, and ultimately in a normal metal. Our results provide a new route to the supersolid phase via the introduction of impurities at fixed positions which both increase quantum fluctuations and also are immune to the competing tendency to phase separation often observed in the doped case.</p>

            <p>The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations can induce rich phenomena at finite temperatures in strongly correlated fermion systems. Here we report a {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) study for the finite-temperature properties of three-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model at half filling. We concentrate on the complete temperature-interaction strength phase diagram of the model, which contains the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phase and metal-insulator crossover (MIC) in the paramagnetic phase. Enabling access to unprecedented system sizes up to $20^3$, we achieve highly accurate results of the Néel transition temperature for representative values of on-site interaction $U$ via finite-size analysis of AFM structure factor. To quantitatively characterize the MIC above the Néel transition, we have developed fully new techniques allowing to compute the thermal entropy versus $U$ at fixed temperature and to directly calculate the $U$-derivative of double occupancy in AFQMC simulations. Then combining variously thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish an efficient scheme to precisely determine the boundaries for the MIC by cross-checking different observables. We also demonstrate the temperature dependence of many commonly used observables. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and AFM spin correlation versus hole doping, and demonstrate the persistance of Néel AFM ordered phase to finite doping with limited results.</p>

            <p>In this work, it is shown that improvements can be introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas to take into account the quantum nature of phase space, which is related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particle number, the internal energy, the Von Neumann entropy, and the pressure, as well as the thermodynamic state equations corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperatures and for confined volumes. They allow for the highlighting of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamic functions and variables are directly related to the quantum statistical variances of the momenta. Well-known relations corresponding to the classical ideal gas model can be recovered from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperatures and for large volumes.</p>

For $n \to \infty$, $1/v_n(\vec{r}) = u_{n-1}(\vec{r})/u_{n}(\vec{r})$ converges to the lowest eigenenergy $E_1$ of ${\hat H}$ whereas $u_{\infty}(\vec{r})$ yields the corresponding wave function $\psi_1(\vec{r})$. For large but finite $n$, $v_n(\vec{r})$ can be approximated by a piecewise constant function $v_n(\vec{r}) \simeq v_n^{(m)}$ for $\vec{r} \in \Omega_m$ and yields progressively improving estimations of eigenenergies $E_m = 1/v_n^{(m)}$ of locally fundamental eigenstates $\psi_m(\vec{r}) \propto u_{n}(\vec{r})$ in spatial domains $\Omega_m$. These general results are illustrated by a number of examples in one dimension: box potential, sequence of randomly placed infinite potential barriers, smooth and spatially uncorrelated random potentials, quasiperiodic potential, as well as for the uncorrelated random potential in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. First, by exciting the sample with an intense THz pulse and probing the magnetization dynamics using magneto-optical Faraday effect, we find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via the THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects and paves the way towards novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Shape-controlled Bose-Einstein Condensation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cem Kurt, Altug Sisman, Alhun Aydin</p>
            <p>Size-invariant shape transformation is a geometric technique that allows for a clear separation between quantum size and shape effects by modifying the shape of the confinement domain without altering its size. The impact of shape on the behavior of confined systems is significantly different from that of size, making it an emerging area of research. The recent realization of flat-bottomed optical box traps has further contributed to the study of quantum gases in complex confinement geometries. Here, we propose shape-induced Bose-Einstein condensation at a fixed size, temperature, and density. We investigate the impact of pure quantum shape effects on a non-interacting Bose gas confined within nested square domains, where the shape parameter is defined and controlled by the rotation angle between the inner and outer squares. Our findings reveal that specific heat exhibits an additional low-temperature peak at certain shapes. This work opens new avenues for controlling quantum systems through geometric manipulation and provides insights into the thermodynamic properties of Bose gases under shape-induced quantum effects.</p>

            <p>We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by multiple superconductors and discover the emergence of exceptional points entirely determined by the interplay of the distinct superconducting phases and non-Hermiticity due to normal reservoirs. In particular, in Josephson junctions with three and four superconductors, we find stable lines and surfaces of exceptional points protected by non-Hermitian topology and highly tuneable by the superconducting phases. We also discover that, in Josephson junctions formed by laterally coupled superconductors, exceptional points can result from hybridized Andreev bound states and lead to the enhancement of supercurrents controlled by dissipation. Our work unveils the potential of multi-terminal Josephson junctions for realizing higher dimensional topological non-Hermitian superconducting phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Polarizability and Tunable Diamagnetic Shifts from Charged Localized Emitters in WSe2 on a Relaxor Ferroelectric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiaohui Zhou, Fei Wang, Ali Soleymani, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jiang Wei, Xin Lu</p>
            <p>Strain modulation is a crucial way in engineering nanoscale materials. It is even more important for single photon emitters in layered materials, where strain can create quantum emitters and control their energies. Here we report the localized, charge-enhanced coupling between the charged localized emitters in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) to the piezoelectric relaxor ferroelectric substrate. In addition to the strain effect, we observe a gigantic polarizability volume with the enhancement factor up to 1010. The enormous polarizability leads to a large Quantum-confined Stark shift under a small variation of electric field, indicating the potential of integrating layered materials with functional substrates for quantum sensing. We further demonstrate the tunable diamagnetic shift and g-factor with strain varying by ~0.05%, which confirms the existence of enhanced interaction between the localized oscillating dipoles and the ferroelectric domains. Our results signify the prospect of charged quantum emitters in layered materials for quantum sciences and technology.</p>

            <h2>Josephson diodes induced by the loop current states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Kai Shen, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid-Order Topological Phase And Transition in 1H Transition Metal Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning-Jing Yang, Zhigao Huang, Jian-Min Zhang</p>
            <p>Inspired by recent experimental observations of hybrid topological states [Hossain et al. Nature 628, 527 (2024)], we predict hybrid-order topological insulators in 1H transition metal compounds (TMCs), where both second-order and first-order topological (FOT) states coexist near the Fermi level. Initially, 1H-TMCs exhibit a second-order topological phase due to the d orbital bandgap. Upon coupling of p and d orbitals through the crystal field effect, first-order topological characteristics emerge. This hybrid-order topological phase transition can be tuned via crystal field effects. Combined with first-principles calculations, we illustrate the phase transition with WTe2 and NbSe2. The WTe2 exhibits hybrid-order under ambient conditions, while NbSe2 transitions to hybrid-order under pressure. Additionally, the first-order topological bandgap in the HyOTI demonstrates a strong spin Hall effect. Our findings reveal a hybrid-order topological phase in two-dimensional electron materials and underscore spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Damiano De Angelis, Jacopo De Nardis, Stefano Scopa</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of density-density correlations in a 1D gas of hard-core particles initially prepared at equilibrium (either at zero or finite temperature) on a semi-infinite line and subsequently let to expand into the other (initially empty) half of the system. Using a combination of analytical techniques based on exact methods and asymptotic hydrodynamic approaches, we discuss the behavior of the gas as its initial temperature varies, and back up our derivations with numerical exact diagonalization of the model. Our findings reveal that, irrespective of the initial temperature, the non-equilibrium behavior of density-density correlations at sufficiently large times is characterized by algebraic decay. Furthermore, we provide analytical results based on quantum generalized hydrodynamics that match with the numerical data both at zero and finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Coupled spin and valley Hall effects driven by coherent tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Zeng</p>
            <p>We predict the coexistence of tunneling spin and valley Hall effects when electrons in graphene coherently transmit through a barrier with the broken inversion symmetry and proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. Due to the rotation of the pseudospin in the tunneling process, the transmitted electrons acquire a finite spin- and valley-dependent backreflection geometric phase when the two interfaces of the barrier are asymmetric. This results in a spin- and valley-dependent skew coherent tunneling, which is responsible for the transverse spin and valley Hall currents. We further demonstrate that the coherent-tunneling assisted charge-spin and charge-valley conversions are highly efficient with large Hall angles. Our work provides a new route for the generation of efficient spin and valley Hall effects, suggesting potential applications for spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.</p>

            <p>Acoustic modulation of quantum dots allows one to control the scattering of photons. Here we theoretically characterize the degree of this acoustic control in the frequency domain. We formulate the theory of low-intensity resonance fluorescence in the presence of white noise and show that a high level of control is achievable with a two-tone acoustic field for appropriate settings of modulation amplitudes as long as the noise-induced phase diffusion coefficient remains one order of magnitude smaller than the acoustic frequency. In addition, using a quantitative model of optical signal collection, we determine that the acoustic phase must be stable over $\mathbf{10^4}$ to $\mathbf{10^5}$ acoustic periods for efficient control.</p>

            <p>Collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on user-item similarities through rating data, which may involve numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), are often employed to predict scores for unrated items. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. Previous studies have employed NBMF for image analysis where the data were dense. In this paper, we propose a modified NBMF algorithm that can be applied to collaborative filtering where data are sparse. In the modified method, unrated elements in a rating matrix are masked, which improves the collaborative filtering performance. Utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</p>

            <h2>Backbone Mediated Electrical Transport in a Double-Stranded DNA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Kundu, Siddhartha Lal</p>
            <p>In the field of DNA nanotechnology, it is common wisdom that charge transport occurs through the {\pi} stacked bases of double-stranded DNA. However, recent experimental findings by Zhuravel et. al. [Nat. Nanotech. 15, 836 (2020)] suggest that electronic transport happens through the backbone channels instead of {\pi}-{\pi} interaction of the nitrogen bases. These new experimental insights call for a detail investigation. In keeping with this, we examine charge transport properties of three characteristic double-stranded DNA sequences (periodic GC, periodic AT and random ATGC sequences) within a tight-binding framework where backbones form the main conduction channels. Using techniques based on the Green function method, we inspect the single-particle density of states and localization properties of DNA in the presence of discontinuities (nicks) along the backbone channels. We also investigate the effect of these nicks on current-voltage response using the Landauer - Buttiker formalism for a two-terminal geometry where the source electrode is attached to one backbone strand and the drain to the other. We observe that the periodic DNA sequence of GC bases is metallic in nature, while the periodic AT sequence and the random ATGC sequence are insulating. Further, the effects of nicks on the transport properties of the periodic GC sequence is interesting: while a single nick on the upper backbone does not affect electronic transport, the addition of a second nick on the lower backbone causes the current to vanish altogether. This is found to be robust against changes in the positions of the nicks, as well as the alternation of the source and drain electrodes.</p>

            <p>Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG residing on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium monoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly spin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\,\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular distribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how the induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the overlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that the EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO overlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers. Additional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus the spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the magnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects indicate that the EuO/STO (001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional spin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semianalytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As a demonstration of their capabilities, we show that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.</p>

            <p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle moving on a half-line with a periodic force field and an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two fixed values at Poisson-distributed times. The particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics. The periodic force field is assumed to be such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation. The Laplace transform of this equation yields systems of equations satisfied by the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle reaches the origin in finite time almost surely. We calculate the exit probability of the particle, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the exit probability is less than one. If the force field is a constant drift, the condition is satisfied by positive values of the drift. The mean first-passage time of the particle (averaged over trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form in both regimes.</p>

            <p>We analyze the aggregation of locally amphiphilic copolymers with blocky architecture and uniformly distributed amphiphilic moieties in terms of a mean-field theory. Locally amphiphilic structure is characteristic of many thermoresponsive polymers, both linear and grafted, which endows them with local surface activity. Self-assembly of such copolymers exhibits a rich diversity of morphologies, which are analyzed in the present work in the limit of high surface activity of amphiphilic dimers with solvophilic/polar pendants. Depending on the composition and architecture of the copolymer and sizes and interaction parameters of the solvophilic/polar pendants, we build morphological diagrams of copolymer solutions. Copolymers with small volume pendants form precipitates or large aggregates with internal voids containing these pendants. For moderate volume pendants, a lamellar structure (or large vesicles) is observed at smaller fractions of amphiphilic monomer units in the chain and micelles are formed at larger fractions of these units. The sizes and shapes of micelles depend on the monomer distribution along the chain, and the blocky architecture favors the existence of single spherical micelles or spherical particles that constitute compound micelles. For sufficiently large polar pendants, copolymers of both types mainly form granular branched compound micelles. The distance at which adjacent hydrophobic and polar groups are located in a chain determines the size of domains and particles formed by locally amphiphilic blocks or chains. Our predictions explain the existence of dense multicore complex micelles consisting of beads of several tens of nanometers size and other structures such as disc-shaped micelles.</p>

            <p>Second-order topological superconductors host Majorana corner modes (MCMs), which are confined to specific corners of the system. This spatial restriction presents challenges for manipulating and relocating MCMs. We propose a novel protocol for dynamically controlling the movement of time-reversal symmetric MCMs in a heterostructure consisting of a 2D Weyl semimetal and a $d$-wave superconductor. By leveraging the energy asymmetry of topological edge states in the 2D Weyl semimetal, the position of MCMs can be effectively tuned via chemical potential adjustments. We further introduce a device architecture that integrates multiple heterostructure blocks, each controlled by independent gate voltages, to enable the adiabatic movement and exchange of MCMs. This approach demonstrates a robust mechanism for Majorana manipulation and provides a scalable framework for future experimental studies of topological quantum computation.</p>

Spin-valley-dependent electronic states with distinct spin textures offer potential applications in spintronic devices. Our calculations reveal helical and chiral spin texture for spin-up, and spin-down respectively, by opposing electron and hole orientation in the conduction and valence bands. The Berry curvature behavior in the vicinity of the Dirac points for different values of $\alpha$, reveals a sign change and topological phase transitions in 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$. When $\alpha<1$, the system exhibits the Quantum Spin Hall Insulator (QSHI) phase ($C_s=1$), characterized by a non-trivial gap and helical edge mode. $\alpha>1$ is responsible for a topological phase transition to the band insulator (BI) ($C_v=1$) and killing the edge modes. Also when $\alpha=1$ the Fermi energy falls within the bands, consequently, the Chern number is not defined. Calculations of spin Nernst (SNC), valley Nernst (VNC), and total Nernst coefficients (TNC) further confirm the QSHI-to-BI phase transition under varying $\alpha$ and doping. These results provide comprehensive insights into the tunable topological properties of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ and their implications for spintronic and valleytronic applications.</p>

            <p>We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower. Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., Phys. Rev. B 103, 155102 (2021), arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 011037 (2022), arXiv:2106.05959).

Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting can emerge in the AB-stacking configurations. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP2S6, MnPX3 can show switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on its band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field.

            <p>A model of the non-concentric spherical core-shell quantum dot under the influence of an externally applied electric field was proposed. It was established that the energy spectrum of both the electron and the hole depends on the intensity of the electric field as well as on the specific location of the core within the quantum dot. The phenomenon of energy level splitting and degeneration was analyzed in detail. Additionally, the variations in the optical gap were determined and expressed as a function of the applied electric field strength and the position of the core in the quantum dot.</p>

            <p>The exact recursion relations are used to study the mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2) Blume-Capel Ising ferrimagnetic system on the Bethe lattice. Ground-state phase diagrams are computed in the $({D_{A}}/{q|J|}, {D_{B}}/{q|J|})$ plane to reveal different possible ground states of the model. Using the thermal changes of the order-parameters, interesting temperature dependent phase diagrams are constructed in the ($D_{A}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$), ($D_{B}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) planes as well as in the ($D/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) plane where $D=D_A=D_B$. It is revealed that the system exhibits first- and second-order phase transitions and compensation temperatures for specific model parameter values. Under the constraint of an external magnetic field, the model also produces multi-hysteresis behaviors as single, double and triple hysteresis cycles. Particularly, the impacts of the ferrimagnetic coupling $J$ on the remanent magnetization and the coercitive fields for selected values of the other physical parameters of the system are pointed out. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with those reported in the literature.</p>

We have also studied the temperature dependence of the internal energy $U(T_{\rm ph})$ at constant $q$ and an influence of the size related effects on the system thermodynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Bradji, M. L. Benkhedir</p>
            <p>In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Si-Qi Yu, Wei Cheng, Chuang Li, Xiao-Hong Pan, Gang Xu, Fu-Chun Zhang, Xin Liu</p>
            <p>Building on the multiband nature of iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), we have uncovered pronounced anisotropy in Majorana vortex topology arising from the interaction between vortex orientation and multiple electronic topologies. This anisotropy manifests in two distinct vortex configurations: the z-vortex and x-vortex, oriented perpendicular and parallel to the Dirac axis (z-axis for FeSCs), respectively. The x-vortex exhibits a unique duality, displaying two distinct topological phase diagrams. One is strikingly simple, comprising only trivial and topological superconducting phases, and remains resilient to multiband entanglement. The other mirrors the z-vortex's complex diagram, featuring alternating trivial, topological crystalline and topological superconducting phases. Crucially, the former is exclusive to the x-vortex and supports unpaired Majorana vortices across a wide parameter range, even with Dirac nodes in electronic bands. Notably, uniaxial strain can modulate these x-vortex phases, enabling the x-vortex to support both stable Majorana vortices and rich exotic physics in a controllable manner. Moreover, we propose that the x-vortex offers promising advantages for developing iron-based superconducting quantum devices. Our findings introduce a novel paradigm in vortex topology within multiband superconducting systems, highlighting the x-vortex as a promising platform for exploring Majorana physics and advancing iron-based superconducting quantum technology.</p>

            <h2>The effect of grain boundary misorientation on hydrogen flux using a phase-field based diffusion and trapping model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abdelrahman Hussein, Byungki Kim, Kim Verbeken, Tom Depover</p>
            <p>Understanding hydrogen-grain boundary (GB) interactions is critical to the analysis of hydrogen embrittlement in metals. This work presents a mesoscale fully kinetic model to investigate the effect of GB misorientation on hydrogen diffusion and trapping using phase-field based representative volume elements (RVEs). The flux equation consists of three terms: a diffusive term and two terms for high and low angle grain boundary (H/LAGB) trapping. Uptake simulations showed that decreasing the grain size resulted in higher hydrogen content due to increasing the GB density. Permeation simulations showed that GBs are high flux paths due to their higher enrichment with hydrogen. Since HAGBs have higher enrichment than LAGBs, due to their higher trap-binding energy, they generally have the highest hydrogen flux. Nevertheless, the flux shows a convoluted behavior as it depends on the local concentration, alignment of GB with external concentration gradient as well as the GB network connectivity. Finally, decreasing the grain size resulted in a larger break-through time and a larger steady-state exit flux.</p>

            <p>Following the concept of creating individual centers, we investigate local electronic states and magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO) induced by substituting oxygen (O) with nitrogen (N). Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seán R. Kavanagh</p>
            <p>Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</p>

            <p>We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</p>

            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We present a non-perturbative framework for incorporating gauge field fluctuations into effective actions of QED3 in the infrared using fermionic particle-vortex duality. This approach is demonstrated through the applications to models containing N species of 2-component Dirac fermions in solvable and interpretable electromagnetic backgrounds, focusing on N = 1 or 2. For the N = 1 model, we establish a correspondence between fermion Casimir energy at finite density and the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, and further evaluate the corrections to their amplitudes. This predicts amplification of charge susceptibility and reduction of magnetic permeability. We additionally provide physical interpretations for each component of our calculation and offer alternative derivations based on energy density measurements in different characteristic lengths. For N = 2, we show that magnetic catalysis is erased in a U(1)xU(1) QED3, indicating no breakdown of chiral symmetry. Reasoning is offered based on the properties of the lowest Landau level wave functions.</p>

            <p>We calculate the typical bipartite entanglement entropy $\langle S_A\rangle_N$ in systems containing indistinguishable particles of any kind as a function of the total particle number $N$, the volume $V$, and the subsystem fraction $f=V_A/V$, where $V_A$ is the volume of the subsystem.

We illustrate the generality of our findings by studying a wide range of different systems, e.g., bosons, fermions, spins, and mixtures thereof. We provide evidence that our analytical results describe the entanglement entropy of highly excited eigenstates of quantum-chaotic spin and boson systems, which is distinct from that of integrable counterparts.</p>

            <p>This work investigates adversarial training in the context of margin-based linear classifiers in the high-dimensional regime where the dimension $d$ and the number of data points $n$ diverge with a fixed ratio $\alpha = n / d$. We introduce a tractable mathematical model where the interplay between the data and adversarial attacker geometries can be studied, while capturing the core phenomenology observed in the adversarial robustness literature. Our main theoretical contribution is an exact asymptotic description of the sufficient statistics for the adversarial empirical risk minimiser, under generic convex and non-increasing losses for a Block Feature Model. Our result allow us to precisely characterise which directions in the data are associated with a higher generalisation/robustness trade-off, as defined by a robustness and a usefulness metric. We show that the the presence of multiple different feature types is crucial to the high sample complexity performances of adversarial training. In particular, we unveil the existence of directions which can be defended without penalising accuracy. Finally, we show the advantage of defending non-robust features during training, identifying a uniform protection as an inherently effective defence mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Bai, Akihiro Miyata, Masahiro Nozaki</p>
            <p>We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.</p>

            <h2>Gravity from entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime {to a quantum operator, playing the role of an renormalizable effective density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-Kähler formalism, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the {\em G-field}, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remain second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergent three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. We also demonstrate that this effective asymmetry generated by the rapid yawing can cause chaotic behaviour in the emergent dynamics, in stark contrast to the emergent dynamics generated by rapidly rotating spheroids, which are equivalent to those of effective passive spheroids. In general, we find that the shape of the equivalent effective particle under rapid yawing is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. In these scenarios, we calculate analytically the equivalent aspect ratio of the effective spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</p>

            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <p>Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influence the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully adjustable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show a quantum simulator system that consists of a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity that can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout, based on a tunnel Josephson junction circuit, of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work is a first step for the development of analog molecule simulators of proton transfer reactions based on quantum superconducting circuits.</p>

The many-body state dynamics entails to ergotropy evolving in a controlled fashion. The implementation we suggest is based on a Rydberg-atom platform.

            <p>Integrating robotically driven contact-based material characterization techniques into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality, reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high-throughputs. Firstly, we design a vision-based, self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses differentiable image priors to optimize domain-specific objectives, refining the pixel precision of predicted robot contact poses by 20.0% relative to existing approaches. Secondly, we design a reliable graph-based planner for generating distance-minimizing paths to accelerate the robot measurement throughput and decrease planning variance by 6x. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3,025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing process defects. With this self-supervised CNN-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.</p>

            <p>Cement production, exceeding 4.1 billion tonnes and contributing 2.4 tonnes of CO2 annually, faces critical challenges in quality control and process optimization. While traditional process models for cement manufacturing are confined to steady-state conditions with limited predictive capability for mineralogical phases, modern plants operate under dynamic conditions that demand real-time quality assessment. Here, exploiting a comprehensive two-year operational dataset from an industrial cement plant, we present a machine learning framework that accurately predicts clinker mineralogy from process data. Our model achieves unprecedented prediction accuracy for major clinker phases while requiring minimal input parameters, demonstrating robust performance under varying operating conditions. Through post-hoc explainable algorithms, we interpret the hierarchical relationships between clinker oxides and phase formation, providing insights into the functioning of an otherwise black-box model. This digital twin framework can potentially enable real-time optimization of cement production, thereby providing a route toward reducing material waste and ensuring quality while reducing the associated emissions under real plant conditions. Our approach represents a significant advancement in industrial process control, offering a scalable solution for sustainable cement manufacturing.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

            <h2>Aharonov-Bohm Interference in Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States</h2>

            <p>Position exchange of non-Abelian anyons affects the quantum state of their system in a topologically-protected way. Their expected manifestations in even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems offer the opportunity to directly study their unique statistical properties in interference experiments. In this work, we present the observation of coherent Aharonov-Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures by employing the Fabry-Pérot interferometry (FPI) technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, $\Delta\Phi=2\Phi_0$, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of $\Delta\Phi=4\Phi_0$ may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge $e^* = \frac{1}{2}e$ or that interference of $e^* = \frac{1}{4}e$ quasiparticles is thermally smeared. Interestingly, at two hole-conjugate states, we also observe oscillation periods of half the expected value, indicating interference of $e^* = \frac{2}{3}e$ quasiparticles instead of $e^* = \frac{1}{3}e$. To probe statistical phase contributions, we operated the FPI with controlled deviations of the filling factor, thereby introducing fractional quasiparticles inside the interference loop. The resulting changes to the interference patterns at both half-filled states indicate that the additional bulk quasiparticles carry the fundamental charge $e^*=\frac{1}{4}e$, as expected for non-Abelian anyons.</p>

            <h2>Chirality-induced pseudo-magnetic fields, flat bands and enhancement of superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyu Dong, Leonid Levitov, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Systems in which exchange interactions couple carrier spins to a spin texture with a net chirality exhibit a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, where the geometric gauge field and pseudo-magnetic field have opposite signs for carriers with opposite spins. As a result, Cooper pairs see a net zero vector potential and superconducting pairing is not hindered by pair-breaking effects. This allows superconductivity to occur even when the geometric field induces quantized Landau levels. We identify the dominant pairing order as an s-wave pair density wave of an FFLO type. Flat Landau levels can significantly enhance superconducting $T_c$, favoring superconductivity over competing orders. This exotic paired state features tell-tale signatures such as flat bands of Bogoliubov-deGennes quasiparticles, manifest through Landau level-like resonances in the quasiparticle density of states.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Diode Effect in Double Quantum Dot Device</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Go Takeuchi, Mikio Eto</p>
            <p>Superconducting diode effect (SDE) is theoretically examined in double quantum dot coupled to three superconducting leads, $L$, $R1$ and $R2$. Lead $L$ is commonly connected to two quantum dots (QD1, QD2) while lead $R1$ ($R2$) is connected to QD1 (QD2) only. The phase differences $\varphi_{1}$ between leads $L$ and $R1$ and $\varphi_{2}$ between leads $L$ and $R2$ are tuned independently. The critical current into lead $R1$ depends on its direction unless $\varphi_{2} = 0$, $\pi$, which is ascribable to the formation of Andreev molecule between the QDs. In the absence of electron-electron interaction $U$ in the QDs, the spectrum of the Andreev bound states forms Dirac cones in the $\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}$ plane if the energy levels in the QDs are tuned to the Fermi level in the leads. The SDE is enhanced to almost 30\% when $\varphi_{2}$ is set to the value at the Dirac points. In the presence of $U$, the SDE is still observed when $U$ is smaller than the superconducting energy gap in the leads. Our device should be one of the minimal models for the SDE since a similar device with a single QD does not show the SDE.</p>

            <h2>Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajesh O. Sharma, Tanmoy Das</p>
            <p>Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for understanding many-body effects and interactions between systems and measurements. A key challenge is identifying appropriate states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating phase space as a manifold, we embed real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equation in the phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence in momentum space, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We then apply the model to a square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT) to unravel a coexistence of nodeless $s_{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.</p>

            <h2>An Addressable and Tunable Module for Donor-based Scalable Silicon Quantum Computing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihang Zhang, Yu He, Peihao Huang</p>
            <p>Donor-based spin qubit offers a promising silicon quantum computing route for building large-scale qubit arrays, attributed to its long coherence time and advancements in nanoscale donor placement. However, the state-of-the-art device designs face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit coupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a surface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable two-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single extra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the requirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is necessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly tunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit operation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning on and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design. Additionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations, allowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our proposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant, donor-based spin quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Spintronic Terahertz emitters, based on optically triggered spin-to-charge interconversion processes, have recently emerged as novel route towards compact and efficient THz sources. Yet, the next challenge for further technologically-relevant devices remains to modulate the emission, with low-energy consumption operation. To this aim, ferroelectric materials coupled to active spin-orbit layers such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are suitable candidates. In this work, we present the realization of a large area heterostructure of CoFeB/PtSe2/MoSe2 on a bi-domain LiNbO3 substrate. Using THz time-domain spectroscopy, we show that the ferroelectric polarization direction induces a sizeable modulation of the THz emission. We rationalise these experimental results by using band structure and spin accumulation calculations that are consistent with an interfacial spin-to-charge conversion mediated by inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect at the MoSe2/PtSe2 interface and being tuned by ferroelectricity in the adjacent LiNbO3 surface. This work points out the relevance of field effect spin-orbit architectures for novel THz technologies.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism Induced Topological Phase Transitions in Kane-Mele Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengtian Li, Zeyu Li, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>We theoretically demonstrate that Chern number tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and second-order topological insulators can be induced in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator (TI), i.e., Kane-Mele model, by applying $d$-wave altermagnetism. When the Néel vector of altermagentism lies in the $x-y$ plane, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TI is broken and driven into a second-order topological insulator phase, exhibiting the representative corner states at nanoflakes. When the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is further included, the second-order TI is further driven into the QAHE phase with various Chern numbers (e.g., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$ or $\pm3$). When the Néel vector is along $z$ direction, the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is necessary to break the mirror symmetry to allow a sequential emergence of second-order TI and QAHE along with the increase of altermagentism strength. We also observe the QAHE with mixed-chirality, i.e., there exist counter-propagating edge modes but net chiral current at the ribbon boundary. Our work shows that altermagnetism can play a crucial role in exploring a rich variety of topological phases, just like its counterparts of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.</p>

            <h2>An ab-initio study on engineering quantum anomalous Hall effect in compensated antiferromagnet MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Li, Yulei Han, Zhenhua Qiao</p>
            <p>Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has been theoretically proposed in compensated antiferromagnetic systems by using the magnetic topological insulator model [see arXiv:2404.13305 (2024)]. However, the related and systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As the only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator, MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological states. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator model, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the physical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external hydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the dramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological nontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of pressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$ heterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations with QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable strategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Transport in Interacting Spin Chains: Exact Derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto</p>
            <p>We theoretically study quantum spin transport in a one-dimensional folded XXZ model with an alternating domain-wall initial state via the Bethe ansatz technique, exactly demonstrating that a probability distribution of finding a left-most up-spin with an appropriate scaling variable converges to the Tracy-Widom distribution for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which is a universal distribution for the largest eigenvalue of GUE under a soft-edge scaling limit. Our finding presented here offers a first exact derivation of the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution in the dynamics of the interacting quantum model not being mapped to a noninteracting fermion Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. On the basis of the exact solution of the folded XXZ model and our numerical analysis of the XXZ model, we discuss a universal behavior for the probability of finding the left-most up-spin in the XXZ model.</p>

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenide moiré homobilayers have emerged as a platform in which magnetism, strong correlations, and topology are intertwined. In a large magnetic field, the energetic alignment of states with different spin in these systems is dictated by both strong Zeeman splitting and the structure of the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum, yet the latter has been difficult to probe experimentally. Here we conduct local thermodynamic measurements of twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers that reveal a cascade of magnetic phase transitions. We understand these transitions as the filling of individual Hofstadter subbands, allowing us to extract the structure and connectivity of the Hofstadter spectrum of a single spin. The onset of magnetic transitions is independent of twist angle, indicating that the exchange interactions of the component layers are only weakly modified by the moiré potential. In contrast, the magnetic transitions are associated with stark changes in the insulating states at commensurate filling. Our work achieves a spin-resolved measurement of Hofstadter's butterfly despite overlapping states, and it disentangles the role of material and moiré effects on the nature of the correlated ground states.</p>

            <h2>Designing Spin-driven Multiferroics in Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ranquan Cao, Ruizhi Dong, Ruixiang Fei, Yugui Yao</p>
            <p>Spin-driven multiferroics exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling, with notable polarization changes under a magnetic field, but these effects are usually limited to high-Z magnetic insulators with low electronic polarization. In this work, we introduce altermagnets as a promising platform for achieving strong magnetoelectric coupling in low-Z systems with substantial polarization. This large polarization arises from a design principle that utilizes the Heisenberg-like exchange striction mechanism, eliminating the reliance on spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This approach enables the Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic phase derived from altermagnetic insulators to achieve substantial polarization without spin splitting, providing a flexible platform for regulating spin-splitting phenomena. Through first-principles simulations and an effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that materials in the LiMnO2 family and strained RuF4 family can achieve polarization values exceeding 1.0 {\mu}C/cm2, an order of magnitude larger than those found in SOC-driven multiferroics. Moreover, their magnetoelectric coupling is one to two orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in conventional multiferroics and those driven by SOC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vitaly V. Chaban, Nadezhda A. Andreeva</p>
            <p>Electrical breakdown in a dielectric capacitor occurs when the electric field strength across the dielectric material exceeds its breakdown strength. A conductive channel through the dielectric emerges, resulting in a sudden surge of current. Self-healing represents a phenomenon of restoration of a capacitor's performance. The efficiency of self-healing depends on the products of high-temperature decomposition of the electrode and dielectric. We report atomistic simulations of the soot's chemical composition in the case of gold electrodes and four popular dielectric polymers: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC), and polyimide (PI). We unravel that gold atoms form clusters within the carbon-rich soot, limiting their interactions with non-metal elements. The oxygen atoms of PET, PC, and PI act as stabilizers of gold thanks to electrostatic attraction. Compared to zinc, gold equalizes the soot conductivity in all samples but does not impact polymer gasification. The suitability of dielectrics for self-healing must be rated based on the volatile by-products: PP > PC > PET > PI. Mind that PP issues three times more gases than PI. Therefore, the size of semiconducting soot is substantially smaller in the case of PP than in the case of PI. The obtained numerical results provide unprecedented physical insights into the phenomenon of self-healing and clearly drive the efforts to extend the lifespans of the metalized film capacitors.</p>

            <h2>A Universal Method to Transform Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules into Confined Carbyne inside Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes</h2>

            <p>Carbyne, a sp1-hybridized allotrope of carbon, is a linear carbon chain with exceptional theoretically predicted properties that surpass those of sp2-hybridized graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). However, the existence of carbyne has been debated due to its instability caused by Peierls distortion, which limits its practical development. The only successful synthesis of carbyne has been achieved inside CNTs, resulting in a form known as confined carbyne (CC). However, CC can only be synthesized inside multi-walled CNTs, limiting its property-tuning capabilities to the inner tubes of the CNTs. Here, we present a universal method for synthesizing CC inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm. Aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are filled inside SWCNTs and subsequently transformed into CC under low-temperature annealing. A variety of aromatic hydrocarbon molecules are confirmed as effective precursors for formation of CC, with Raman frequencies centered around 1861 cm-1. Enriched (6,5) and (7,6) SWCNTs with diameters less than 0.8 nm are less effective than the SWCNTs with diameter of 0.9-1.3 nm for CC formation. Furthermore, resonance Raman spectroscopy reveals that optical band gap of the CC at 1861 cm-1 is 2.353 eV, which is consistent with the result obtained using a linear relationship between the Raman signal and optical band gap. This newly developed approach provides a versatile route for synthesizing CC from various precursor molecules inside diverse templates, which is not limited to SWCNTs but could extend to any templates with appropriate size, including molecular sieves, zeolites, boron nitride nanotubes, and metal-organic frameworks.</p>

            <p>Capacitor self-healing is a generalized term to describe physical and chemical processes restoring the functionalities of a dielectric capacitor after an electrical breakdown. The efficacy of self-healing depends on the elemental composition of a metalized-film capacitor. We report atomistic simulations of self-healing from a chemical perspective proving the impossibility of tuning the electrical conductivity of the soot by finding an interplay of various polymers and electrodes. All investigated soot samples turn out to possess carbon-rich semiconducting skeletons with numerous unsaturated C-C covalent bonds. They exhibit electrical conductivities of the same order of magnitude, irrespective of initial chemical compositions and properties of the chosen insulating polymers. Upon reporting the new results, we discuss less evident approaches to diminish the soot conductivity. We conclude that the quality of capacitor self-healing can be assessed by counting gaseous by-products of electrical breakdown or evaluating the volume of the solid-state semiconducting counterpart.</p>

            <p>Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: one is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.</p>

In the literature, the breathing kagome lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping is often mentioned as an example of a two-dimensional second-order topological insulator.

Furthermore, we topologically classify all three-band lattice models with the same crystalline symmetries as the breathing kagome lattice and show that though none of the phases have protected zero-energy corner states, some of the phases are obstructed atomic limits which exhibit a filling anomaly.</p>

            <p>Determining the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an essential step towards uncovering their superconducting mechanism. It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Under external stimuli, lead halide perovskites exhibit large atomic fluctuations, impacting optical and electron transport properties that affect device performance in operational settings. However, a thorough understanding of the atomic basis for the underlying structural instability is still absent. Focusing on the model material CsPbBr$_3$, the inherent lattice softness of halide perovskites is elucidated at the atomic level through in-situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements under pressure complemented by atomic level simulations. We identify and explore the nature of the first-order phase transition to a distorted P21/c phase at 1.3 GPa, induced by the sudden Cs-Br bonds breaking. Unlike classical transition metal oxide perovskites, where the internal energy term dominates, we show explicitly that pressure primarily influences the Gibbs free energy for halide perovskites through the pressure-volume term. As such, strategically mitigating bond strains from volume shrinkage is the key to suppressing the first-order behavior for maintaining the coordinates of PbX$_6$ polyhedral upon external perturbation. Our thermodynamic calculation reveals the demand for high entropy in the -T*del-S term, which can be achieved by exploring a broader spectrum of doped A site and B sites in ABX$_3$ systems, enabling continuous structural changes that facilitate recovery from mechanical damage in practical applications.</p>

In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marina Sanino, Isaac Carvalho, Vivian França</p>
            <p>We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</p>

            <p>An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</p>

            <h2>Mott and Wiedemann Franz Law for Monolayer Graphene for Different Scattering Mechanisms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Purnendu Ray, Kingshuk Sarkar</p>
            <p>In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of the thermoelectric responses exhibited by monolayer pristine graphene in response to temperature variations. Employing the Boltzmann transport theory, we rigorously examined and evaluated various thermoelectric coefficients, with particular emphasis on elucidating their behavior under different scattering mechanisms. We derived the analytical expressions for electrical conductivity, thermopower, and thermal conductivity at low temperatures by Sommerfeld expansion of the Fermi integral. We demonstrated that our numerically obtained values are consistent with the analytical calculations at low temperatures and hence obeying Mott and Wiedeman Franz law. However, the deviation was observed at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we performed theoretical calculations of chemical potential at both low and high temperatures and compared them with our numerically evaluated results at all temperatures. Through extensive calculations and meticulous evaluation, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate thermoelectric properties inherent in monolayer pristine graphene.</p>

            <p>We use Brownian dynamics simulations and theory to study the over-damped spatiotemporal dynamics and pattern formation in a fluid-permeated array of equally spaced, active, elastic filaments that are pinned at one end and free at the other. The filaments are modeled as connected colloidal chains with activity incorporated via compressive follower forces acting along the filament backbone. The length of the chains is smaller than the thermal persistence length. For a range of filament separation and activity values, we find that the filament array eventually self-assembles into a series of regularly spaced, kinetically arrested, compact clusters. Filament activity, geometry, elasticity, and grafting density are each seen to crucially influence the size, shape, and spacing of emergent clusters. Furthermore, cluster shapes for different grafting densities can be rescaled into self-similar forms with activity-dependent scaling exponents. We derive theoretical expressions that relate the number of filaments in a cluster and the spacing between clusters, to filament activity, filament elasticity, and grafting density. Our results provide insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the initiation of clustering and suggest that steric contact forces and friction balance active forces and filament elasticity to stabilize the clusters. Our simulations suggest design principles to realize filament-based clusters and similar self-assembling biomimetic materials using active colloids or synthetic microtubule-motor systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenqi Meng, Xinping Yang, Tian Lan, Zhengcheng Gu</p>
            <p>We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</p>

            <p>In the present investigation, the chemical leaching of the poly-grain Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloy have been studied. The polished surfaces of as-cast alloys were leached with 10 mole NaOH solution for 0.5- 8 hours. The x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques have been used for structural and microstructural characterization. Energy dispersive x-ray analysis has been carried out for chemical composition analysis. Chemical leaching exclusively removes the Al from the surfaces of the Al65Cu15Co20 and Al65Cu20Co15 decagonal quasicrystalline alloys, consequently by the formation of porous structure containing nano size particles of Cu, Co and their oxides have been observed. Al65Cu15Co20 exhibits high porosity in comparison to Al65Cu20Co15 alloy, however the size of the precipitated nano-particles i.e. Cu, Co, Cu2O and CuO were smaller in the case of Al65Cu20Co15 alloy. The energy dispersive X-ray analysis mapping suggests homogeneous distribution of Cu and Co found on the leached surface and the presence of oxygen was also detected.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frédéric Paquin-Lefebvre, Alejandro Barea Moreno, David Holcman</p>
            <p>Characterizing the local voltage distribution within nanophysiological domains, driven by ionic currents through membrane channels, is crucial for studying cellular activity in modern biophysics, yet it presents significant experimental and theoretical challenges. Theoretically, the complexity arises from the difficulty of solving electro-diffusion equations in three-dimensional domains. Currently, there are no methods available for obtaining asymptotic computations or approximated solutions of nonlinear equations, and numerically, it is challenging to explore solutions across both small and large spatial scales. In this work, we develop a method to solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with ionic currents entering and exiting through two narrow, circular window channels located on the boundary. The inflow through the first window is composed of a single cation, while the outflow maintains a constant ionic density satisfying local electro-neutrality conditions. Employing regular expansions and Green's function representations, we derive the ionic profiles and voltage drops in both small and large charge regimes. We explore how local surface curvature and window channels size influence voltage dynamics and validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations, assessing the accuracy of our asymptotic computations. These novel relationships between current, voltage, concentrations and geometry can enhance the characterization of physiological behaviors of nanodomains.</p>

            <h2>Crossover of Critical Behavior in Dynamic Phase Transitions of Ferromagnetic Thin Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erol Vatansever, Mikel Quintana, Andreas Berger</p>
            <p>We investigate the crossover of critical behavior for the dynamic phase transition (DPT) in ferromagnetic thin films using Monte Carlo simulations of the kinetic Ising model, focusing on the scaling behavior of the dynamic order parameter under a time-dependent external magnetic field. Specifically, we study the transition of the critical behavior of such film systems from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as a function of the film thickness and the distance to the critical point, which enables dimensional crossover observations. Our results indicate that the effective critical exponents exhibit a clear transition in their scaling behavior, with thinner films showing 2D-like characteristics and thicker films displaying 3D-like behavior, for both the DPT and the thermodynamic phase transitions (TPT). Quantitatively, the crossover from 2D to 3D behavior occurs at larger film thicknesses for the DPT compared to the TPT, suggesting that DPT and TPT are governed by distinctly different length scales and underlying surface effects. These findings are in agreement with experimental observations in ultrathin Co films, where dynamic and thermodynamic critical exponents were found to differ. Therefore, our study provides an in-depth explanation for critical phenomena in thin-film ferromagnets driven by a time-dependent magnetic field. By comparing the dimensional crossover properties of both TPT and DPT, we present a comprehensive understanding of how thin-film geometry and surface effects influence the scaling laws and critical behavior in nonequilibrium systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Beomjoon Goh, Junwon Kim, Hongchul Choi, Ji Hoon Shim</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a non-equilibrium steady-state non-crossing approximation (NESS-NCA) impurity solver applicable to general impurity problems. The choice of the NCA as the impurity solver enables both a more accurate description of correlation effects with larger Coulomb interaction and scalability to multi-orbital systems. Based on this development, we investigate strongly correlated non-equilibrium states of a dissipative lattice system under constant electric fields. Both the electronic Coulomb interaction and the electric field are treated non-perturbatively using dynamical mean-field theory in its non-equilibrium steady-state form (NESS-DMFT) with the NESS-NCA impurity solver. We validate our implementation using a half-filled single-band Hubbard model attached to a fictitious free Fermion reservoir, which prevents temperature divergence. As a result, we identify metallic and insulating phases as functions of the electric field and the Coulomb interaction along with a phase coexistence region amid the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT). We find that the MIT driven by the electric field is qualitatively similar to the equilibrium MIT as a function of temperature, differing from results in previous studies using the iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver. Finally, we highlight the importance of the morphology of a correlated system under the influence of an electric field.</p>

The phonon coupling induces dephasing and broadens the absorption and emission line shapes, while the weakly coupled cavity mode leads to effective driving of the QD. To capture non-Markovian effects, we use non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion and its hierarchical extension the Hierarchy of Pure States to compute multitime correlation functions underlying absorption and resonance fluorescence spectra. We present numerical results for the absorption spectra at strong phonon coupling and finite temperature, as well as for resonance fluorescence spectra at varying phonon coupling strengths and temperatures, and analyse the visibility of the resonance fluorescence spectra to provide insights into how phonon coupling and thermal effects influence the spectral features.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abel Thayil, Lasse Ermoneit, Markus Kantner</p>
            <p>Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by the empirical pseudopotential method to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature and compare our results with previous work. This framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen Liang, Zhenhua Yu</p>
            <p>How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In the relentless pursuit of advancing semiconductor technologies, the demand for atomic layer processes has given rise to innovative processes, which have already played a significant role in the continued miniaturization features. Among these, atomic layer etching (ALE) is gaining increasing attention, offering precise control over material removal at the atomic level. Despite some thermal ALE achieved sub-nm etching controllability, the currently practical ALE processes that involve plasmas steps often suffer from high etch rates due to the scarcity of highly synergistic ALE half-reactions. To overcome this limitation, we developed an ALE process of silicon dioxide (SiO2) on a silicon wafer using sequential pure sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas exposure and argon (Ar) plasma etching near room temperature, achieving a stable and consistent etching rate of approximately 1.4 Å/cycle. In this process, neither of the two half-cycle reactions alone produces etching effects, and etching only occurs when the two are repeated in sequence, which means a 100% synergy. The identification of temperature and plasma power windows further substantiates the high synergy of our ALE process. Moreover, detailed morphology characterization over multiple cycles reveals a directional etching effect. This study provides a reliable, reproducible, and highly controllable ALE process for SiO2 etching, which is promising for nanofabrication processes.</p>

            <p>When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning ratchet imbued with odd transport properties. In the adiabatic limit of a massive object, we derive the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body in a chiral active bath, with odd diffusion and odd mobility connected by an Einstein relation, and numerically explore the breakdown of these predictions beyond the adiabatic limit. We show that the irreversibility of a massive object increases as its symmetry decreases: a disk exhibits an effective equilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational temperatures, and a wedge is fully out of equilibrium. Conversely, this departure from equilibrium can be read in the universal far-field currents and density modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive analytically.</p>

The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force.

            <p>We explore, through a combination of x-ray diffraction and elastoresistivity measurements, the effect of disorder on the strain-tuned charge density wave and associated multicriticality in Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$ (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.026). We focus particularly on the behavior near the strain-tuned bicritical point that occurs in pristine ErTe$_3$ (x=0). Our study reveals that while Pd intercalation somewhat broadens the signatures of the CDW phase transitions, the line of first-order transitions at which the CDW reorients as a function of applied strain persists in the presence of disorder and still seemingly terminates at a critical point. The critical point occurs at a lower temperature and a lower strain compared to pristine ErTe$_3$. Similarly, the nematic elastoresistance of Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$, though suppressed in magnitude and broadened relative to that of ErTe$_3$, has a markedly more symmetric response around the critical point. These observations point to disorder driving a reduction in the system's electronic orthorhombicity even while the material remains irrevocably orthorhombic due to the presence of a glide plane in the crystal structure. Disorder, it would appear, reinforces the emergence of a "pseudo-tetragonal" electronic response in this fundamentally orthorhombic material.</p>

We use Luttinger-Tisza, classical mean-field, and random-phase approximation techniques to model the dispersive crystal field excitons. We find extended-ranged and sign-changing interactions, suggesting a coupling between conduction electrons and the local moments. We demonstrate that low-symmetry anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in contrast with higher-symmetry interactions enabled by Weyl fermions, play an important role in stabilizing the complex spin spiral ground state of NdAlSi.

            <p>Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been observed in an epitaxial L1$_1$-ordered CoPt/CuPt bilayer and attributed to spin-orbit torque (SOT) arising from the crystallographic $3m$ point group of the interface. Using a first-principles nonequilibrium Green's function formalism combined with the Anderson disorder model, we calculate the angular dependence of the SOT in a CoPt/CuPt bilayer and find that the magnitude of the $3m$ SOT is about 20% of the conventional dampinglike SOT. We further study the magnetization dynamics in perpendicularly magnetized films in the presence of $3m$ SOT and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, using the equations of motion for domain wall dynamics and micromagnetic simulations. We find that for systems with strong interfacial DMI characterized by the Néel character of domain walls, a very large current density is required to achieve deterministic switching because reorientation of the magnetization inside the domain wall is necessary to induce the switching asymmetry. For thicker films with relatively weak interfacial DMI and the Bloch character of domain walls the deterministic switching with much smaller currents is possible, which agrees with recent experimental findings.</p>

            <p>A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kangle Li, Liujun Zou</p>
            <p>The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal Rényi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jagannath Sutradhar, Jonathan Ruhman, Avraham Klein, Dimitri Gutman, Richard Berkovits</p>
            <p>The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</p>

            <h2>Lorentz Transformation of the Energy Spectrum of the Equilibrium State of Massive Free Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruohan Xu, Tingzhang Shi, H. T. Quan</p>
            <p>In previous studies of relativistic thermodynamics, the temperature of a static system, as perceived by a moving observer, has traditionally been treated as a scalar. This assumption has also been extended to the research on the cosmic microwave background. However, the validity of this assumption is a consequence of the massless nature of photons. More generally, when an observer is in relative motion to a system, the thermal equilibrium state is characterized by a four-vector temperature. In this paper, we study the non-interacting massive Bosonic and Fermionic field systems. We derive the Lorentz transformation of the energy spectral density in the equilibrium state of these fields. In the massless limit for bosonic field, our results recover the transformation of black body radiation [G. W. Ford and R. F. O' Connell., Phys. Rev. E, 88, 044101(2013)], which corresponds to a scalar temperature with dipole anisotropy. For the massive fields, the moving equilibrium state cannot be characterized by a corresponding scalar temperature. This result shows the necessity of introducing four-vector temperature in relativistic thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Universality of Top Rank Statistics for Brownian Reshuffling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zdzislaw Burda, Mario Kieburg</p>
            <p>We study the dynamical aspects of the top rank statistics of particles, performing Brownian motions on a half-line, which are ranked by their distance from the origin. For this purpose, we introduce an observable that we call the overlap ratio $\Omega(t)$, whose average is the probability that a particle that is on the top-$n$ list at some time will also be on the top-$n$ list after time $t$. The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the top of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It is simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the average overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state that undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a reflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we show that for $N\rightarrow \infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple form $\langle \Omega(t)\rangle = {\rm erfc}(a \sqrt{t})$ for $n\gg 1$ with some scaling parameter $a>0$. This result is a very good approximation even for moderate sizes of the top-$n$ list such as $n=10$. Moreover, as we show, the overlap ratio exhibits universal behavior observed in many dynamical systems including geometric Brownian motion, Brownian motion with a position-dependent drift and a soft barrier on one side, the Bouchaud-Mézard wealth distribution model, and Kesten processes.</p>

            <h2>High-pressure growth effects on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide superconductors</h2>

            <p>High-pressure synthesis can be an effective method for improving the sample quality of materials as well as their superconducting properties. In this paper, the synthesis process of F- doped SmFeAsO has been optimized by preparing a series of bulk SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 (Sm1111) using the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method, considering various growth parameters like growth pressures (0-1 GPa) and heating time (0.5-2 h). Structural, microstructural, Raman spectroscopic, transport, and magnetic measurements are employed to comprehensively analyze these bulks and derive the conclusive findings. The parent SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 prepared by the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) has a transition temperature (Tc) of around 53-54 K, and the critical current density (Jc) of 103 A/cm2 at 5 K with a small amount of the impurity phases (SmOF and SmAs), consistent with previous reports. Interestingly, all bulks synthesized by HP-HTS have almost the same Tc and Jc as the parent sample. The optimal growth conditions are obtained as 900C, 1 hour, and 0.5 GPa with the sealed Ta-tube, which slightly improved the sample quality and the superconducting properties compared to other bulks grown by HP-HTS. Our study confirms that the existence of the impurity phases in the 1111 family is very robust and cannot be reduced by HP-HTS, leading to only a small variation in the observed superconducting properties of Sm1111 whether prepared by CSP or HP-HTS. This is the first comprehensive investigation of the high-pressure development of Sm1111, which shows distinct behaviour from other families of iron-based superconductors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuotao Xie, Yu-Feng Song, Yuan-Yao He</p>
            <p>We present a {\it numerically exact} study of the Hubbard model with spin-dependent anisotropic hopping on the square lattice using auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. At half-filling, the system undergoes Ising phase transitions upon cooling, leading to the formation of Ising-type antiferromagnetic order for repulsive interactions and charge density wave order for attractive interactions at finite temperatures. By elegantly implementing the sign-problem-free condition and Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations, we achieve significant improvements in precision control of the numerical calculations, and obtain highly accurate results of the transition temperatures from weak to strong interactions across representative anisotropies. We further characterize the system by examining the temperature dependence of various thermodynamic properties, including the energy, double occupancy, specific heat and charge susceptibility. Specifically, we provide unbiased numerical results of the entropy map on temperature-interaction plane, the critical entropy, and the spin, singlon and doublon correlations, all of which are directly measurable in optical lattice experiments. Away from half-filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and investigate the possible emergence of stripe spin-density wave order in the system with repulsive interaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.J. Calderón, A. Camjayi, A. Datta, E. Bascones</p>
            <p>Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</p>

The connection of the trimeron arrangement with site-selective doping of magnetite is discussed.

            <h2>Unsupervised Classification of Non-Hermitian Topological Phases under Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Long, Haoran Xue, Baile Zhang</p>
            <p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into fundamental science has opened new possibilities to address long-standing scientific challenges rooted in mathematical limitations. For example, topological invariants are used to characterize topology, but there is no universally applicable one. This limitation explains why, in the past decades-long classification of topological phases of matter -- mainly focused on Hermitian systems -- many phases initially classified ``trivial" were later identified as topological. Recently, the discovery of non-Hermitian band topology has spurred substantial efforts in non-Hermitian topological classification, including the development of new topological invariants. However, such classifications similarly risk overlooking key topological features. Here, without relying on any topological invariant, we develop an AI-based unsupervised classification of symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases. This algorithm distinguishes topological differences among non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with symmetries, and constructs, in an unsupervised manner, a topological periodic table for non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, it can account for the boundary effects, enabling the exploration of open-boundary effects on the topological phase diagram. These results introduce an unsupervised approach for classifying symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases without omission and provide valuable guidance for the development of theories and experiments.</p>

            <p>Coherent manipulation of lattice vibrations using ultrafast light pulses enables access to nonequilibrium 'hidden' phases with designed functionalities in quantum materials. However, expanding the understanding of nonlinear light-phonon interaction mechanisms remains crucial for developing new strategies. Here, we report re-entrant ultrafast phase transitions in SrTiO3 driven by intense terahertz excitation. As the terahertz field increases, the system transitions from the quantum paraelectric (QPE) ground state to an intermediate ferroelectric phase, and then unexpectedly reverts to a QPE state above ~500 kV/cm. The latter hidden QPE phase exhibits distinct lattice dynamics compared to the initial phases, highlighting activated antiferrodistortive phonon modes. Aided by first-principles dynamical calculations, we identify the mechanism for these complex behaviors as a superposition of multiple coherently excited eigenstates of the polar soft mode. Our results reveal a previously uncharted quantum facet of SrTiO3 and open pathways for harnessing high-order excitations to engineer quantum materials in the ultrafast regime.</p>

            <p>Weinvestigate the topological phase transition of Kitaev spin liquid in an external magnetic field by calculating the Berry curvature and the Fubini-Study metric. Employing Jordan-Wigner transformation and effective perturbative theory to transform the Hamiltonian into fermionic quadratic form, the Berry curvature is calculated by choosing the effective magnetic field as the parameter, and we find that the xy-component of the Berry curvature has the same behavior around the critical lines with the phase diagram and the behavior of Berry curvature around the critical line will not be influenced by local perturbation, i.e. it has the robustness against the local perturbation. Especially, we relate the Berry curvature with the derivative of effective magnetic susceptibility which can be regarded as the signature of topological phase transition besides, we related the second nonlinear susceptibility with the non-Abelian Berry connection. Then we analytically calculate the generalized Berry curvature in the mixed state called mean Uhlmann curvature which can be related with the spectral function, the curves that mean Uhlmanncurvaturechangingtemperaturewithdifferentcouplingconstant reveal that it will have an extrema when adjust $J_x$ from $A$ phase to $B$ phase. At last we analytically calculate the quantum geometric tensor in the effective magnetic field space whose imaginary part is the Berry curvature and real part is the Fubini-Study metric, and we find that the zz-component of Fubini-Study metric and the phase diagram are highly correlated which will peak at the cross point of three phases, then the Fubini-Study metric is extended to the finite temperature with arising an additional term called Fisher-Rao metric caused by mixed state.</p>

            <h2>The global critical current effect of superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heng Wu, Yaojia Wang, Mazhar N. Ali</p>
            <p>Superconductivity has been investigated for over a century, but there are still open questions about what determines the critical current; the maximum current a superconductor can carry before switching to its normal state. For a given superconductor, the zero-field critical current is widely believed to be determined by its inherent properties and be related to its critical magnetic field. Here, by studying superconducting polycrystalline films, single crystal flakes, and layered heterostructures, we find that the critical current of a superconductor can vary with measurement configuration. It can be influenced, or even determined, by adjacent superconducting segments along the applied current trajectory, whereas the critical magnetic field and critical temperature remain unaffected. This global critical current effect both reveals the need to revisit fundamental theory describing superconductivity, as well as implies that superconductors can transfer critical current related properties to each other. We demonstrate this by designing and fabricating a simple superconducting structure that transferred a superconducting diode effect from one segment to another segment which could not manifest the effect on its own. This observation merits a reconsideration of contemporary superconducting circuit design, and developing a full understanding will lead to a new paradigm of superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>The spin-12 three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder is studied under open boundary condition (OBC) and cylinder boundary condition (CBC), using the density matrix renormalization group and matrix product state methods, respectively. Specifically, we calculate the energy density, entanglement entropy, and concurrence while discussing the effects of interleg interaction J2 and the alternating coupling parameter gamma on these quantities. It is found that the introduction of gamma can completely reverse the concurrence distribution between odd and even bonds. Under CBC, the generation of the interleg concurrence is inhibited when gamma=0, and the introduction of gamma can cause interleg concurrence between chains 1 and 3, in which the behavior is more complicated due to the competition between CBC and gamma. Additionally, we find that gamma induces two types of long-distance entanglement (LDE) in the system under OBC: intraleg LDE and inter-leg one. When the system size is sufficiently large, both types of LDE reach similar strength and stabilize at a constant value. The study indicates that the three-leg ladder makes it easier to generate LDE compared with the two-leg system. However, the generation of LDE is inhibited under CBC which the spin frustration exists. In addition, the calculated results of energy, entanglement entropy and concurrence all show that there are essential relations between these quantities and phase transitions of the system. Further, we predict a phase transition point near gamma=0.54 under OBC. The present study provides valuable insights into understanding the phase diagram of this class of systems.</p>

We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.</p>

            <p>The long sought cubic gauche polymeric nitrogen (cg-N) consisting of N-N single bonds has been synthesized by a simple route using sodium azide as a precursor at ambient conditions. The recrystallization process was designed to expose crystal faces with low activation energy that facilitates initiating the polymeric reaction at ambient conditions. The azide was considered as a precursor due to the low energy barrier in transforming double bonded N=N to single bonded cg-N. Raman spectrum measurements detected the emerging vibron peaks at 635 cm-1 for the polymerized sodium azide samples, demonstrating the formation of cg-N with N-N single bonds. Different from traditional high pressure technique and recently developed plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method, the route achieves the quantitative synthesis of cg-N at ambient conditions. The simple method to synthesize cg-N offers potential for further scale up production as well as practical applications of polymeric nitrogen based materials as high energy density materials.</p>

Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range.

SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate.

Si atoms segregate to the misfit dislocations, with segregation to full dislocations being stronger. The interface diffusion is dominated by short-circuit diffusion along the misfit dislocations, creating a significant diffusion anisotropy. Diffusion of Al and Si atoms along the full misfit dislocations is faster than along the partial misfit dislocations. Due to the presence of the misfit dislocations, diffusion at the Al(110)/Si(001) interface studied here is faster than diffusion at the Al(111)/Si(111) interfaces investigated in our previous work.</p>

These results not only help to understand the intriguing properties of VI3, such as the pronounced anomalous thermal Hall effects and strong pressure/structure dependence of magnetism, but also open a new avenue for exploring Kitaev physics.</p>

            <p>Magnetic materials phase reconstruction from Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) measurements has traditionally been achieved using longstanding methods such as off-axis holography (OAH) and the transport-of-intensity equation (TIE). Amidst the increase in access to processing power and the development of advanced algorithms, phase retrieval of nanoscale magnetic materials with higher fidelity and resolution, potentially down to the few nanometer limit, becomes possible. Specifically, reverse-mode automatic differentiation (RMAD) and the extended electron ptychography iterative engine (ePIE) are two methods that have been utilized for high confidence phase reconstructions using LTEM through-focal series imaging and Lorentz scanning TEM (Ltz-4D-STEM), respectively. This work evaluates phase retrieval using TIE, RMAD, and ePIE in simulations consisting of an array of Permalloy (Ni80Fe20) nanoscale islands. Extending beyond simulations, we demonstrate total phase reconstructions of a NiFe nanowire using OAH and RMAD in LTEM and ePIE in Ltz-4D-STEM experiments and determine the magnetization saturation through corroborations with micromagnetic simulations. Finally, we show how the total phase shift gradient can be utilized to observe and characterize the proximity effects emanating from neighboring magnetic island interactions and an isolated NiFe nanowire.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the high temperature superconductivity observed in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the spectroscopic evidences of strong electron correlations in this compound, we address the role of its multiorbital electron correlations by proposing a global phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model. We find a Mott transition developing at half filling, and identify strong orbital selectivity when the system is at the physical electron count. The orbital selectivity is manifested in the formation of interlayer spin singlets between electrons in the $z^2$ orbitals. These features lead to a strong renormalization of the electronic band structure while sustaining a sizable splitting between the bonding and antibonding $z^2$ bands. The proposed orbital-selective correlations naturally explain a series of features as observed in the angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and optical conductivity measurements in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our results provide a basis to understand both the normal state and the high temperature superconductivity of multilayer nickelates and thereby elucidate correlated superconductivity in general.</p>

            <p>We study how spatiotemporal chaos in dynamical systems can be controlled by stochastically returning them to their initial conditions. Focusing on discrete nonlinear maps, we analyze how key measures of chaos -- the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, which quantify sensitivity to initial perturbations and the ballistic spread of information, respectively -- are reduced by stochastic resetting. We identify a critical resetting rate that induces a dynamical phase transition, characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, effectively arresting the spread of information. These theoretical predictions are validated and illustrated with numerical simulations of the celebrated logistic map and its lattice extension. Beyond discrete maps, our findings offer insights applicable to a broad class of extended classical interacting systems.</p>

Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect.

            <p>The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect arises from strong electron correlations in a quantising magnetic field, and features exotic emergent phenomena such as electron fractionalisation. Using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach with the combinatorial summation algorithm, we obtain results with controlled accuracy for the microscopic model of interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level. As the temperature is lowered, we study the development and emergence of the incompressible 1/3-filled FQH state. By analysing the long-time decay of the Green's function, we find spectral properties consistent with an energy gap near 1/3-filling, while at half-filling an anomalous power law scaling is observed for short-range interaction screening, indicative of a non-Fermi liquid metal. Our work provides the first demonstration that fractionalised phases of matter can be reliably described with Feynman's diagrammatic technique in terms of the fundamental electronic degrees of freedom, while also showing applicability of expansions in the bare Coulomb potential for precision calculations.</p>

However, accurate treatment of both quasiparticles and collective degrees of freedom is a multi-scale challenge in dynamical simulations of correlated electrons. Here we leverage modern machine learning (ML) methods to achieve a linear-scaling algorithm for simulating the coarsening of charge density waves (CDWs), one of the fundamental symmetry breaking phases in functional electron materials. We demonstrate our approach on the square-lattice Hubbard-Holstein model and uncover an intriguing enhancement of CDW coarsening which is related to the screening of on-site potential by electron-electron interactions. Our study provides fresh insights into the role of electron correlations in non-equilibrium dynamics and underscores the promise of ML force-field approaches for advancing multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.</p>

            <p>Oxyhydrides are gaining attention for their diverse functionality. However, evaluating electron, ion, and phonon transport properties and comprehending their mechanism remains challenging due to the difficulty in oxyhydride synthesis involving the trade-off between achieving density sintering and preventing hydrogen evolution. High-temperature treatments, often required to reduce intergranular resistance, typically cause hydrogen evolution before sufficient sintering. Instead of a post-annealing process aiming for strong chemical connections between oxyhydride particles, this research demonstrates a novel synthesis technique that converts pre-sintered bulk oxides into oxyhydrides while preserving the dense state. The process employs a high-pressure diffusion control method, facilitating the co-diffusion of hydride and oxide ions.</p>

            <p>Wurtzite LaN (wz-LaN) is a semiconducting nitride with favorable piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, making it promising for applications in electronics. We use first-principles density functional theory with a hybrid functional to investigate several features that are key for its use in heterostructures. First, for the purposes of growing wz-LaN on a substrate or designing a heterostructure, we show that it can be lattice-matched with a number of cubic materials along their [111] axes. We also evaluate the bound charge at such interfaces, taking into account both the polarization discontinuity and the piezoelectric polarization due to pseudomorphic strain. Second, we investigate band alignments and assess the results for interfaces with zincblende-, rocksalt-, and perovskite-structure compounds, and with chemically similar wurtzite and rocksalt nitrides. Our results provide guidance for the development of electronic devices based on wz-LaN.</p>

            <p>Sr-doped nickelate, Nd1-xSrxNiO3 (NSNO), perovskite thin films and Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases are actively investigated because of their physical properties, such as the metal-insulator transition and superconductivity. However, achieving epitaxial growth of NSNO perovskite and RP phase films in a sputtering system is challenging compared to pulsed laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, due to the difficulty in stabilizing nickel oxidation states and minimizing structural defects. Here, we used an off-axis radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering to fabricate epitaxial NSNO perovskite and RP phase thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates, systematically controlling the growth temperatures. We investigated the thermal stability of the perovskite phase and the structural and electronic characteristics of the RP phase films. These findings provide valuable insights into the synthesis of nickelate RP phase films using RF magnetron sputtering, paving the way for scalable thin films fabrication technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengwei Zhao, Gang v. Chen</p>
            <p>The mutual feedback between quantum condensed matter and cold atom physics has been quite fruitful throughout history and continues to inspire ongoing research. Motivated by the recent activities on the quantum simulation of topological orders among the ultracold Rydberg atom arrays, we consider the possibility of searching for topological orders among the dipolar quantum magnets and polar molecules with a kagomé lattice geometry. Together with other quantum interactions such as the transverse field, the dipolar interaction endows the kagomé system with a similar structure as the Balents-Fisher-Girvin model and thus fosters the emergence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory to access the topological ordered phase and describe the spinon and vison excitations for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders. We explain the spectroscopic consequences for various quantum phases as well as the experimental detection. We further discuss the rare-earth kagomé magnets, ultracold polar molecules, and cluster Mott insulators for the physical realization.</p>

            <h2>Positional information trade-offs in boundary-driven reaction-diffusion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Berx, Prashant Singh, Karel Proesmans</p>
            <p>Individual components such as cells, particles, or agents within a larger system often require detailed understanding of their relative position to act accordingly, enabling the system as a whole to function in an organised and efficient manner. Through the concept of positional information, such components are able to specify their position in order to, e.g., create robust spatial patterns or coordinate specific functionality. Such complex behaviour generally occurs far from thermodynamic equilibrium and thus requires the dissipation of free energy to sustain functionality. We show that in boundary-driven simple exclusion systems with position-dependent Langmuir kinetics, non-trivial Pareto-optimal trade-offs exist between the positional information, rescaled entropy production rate and global reaction current. Phase transitions in the optimal protocols that tune the densities of the system boundaries emerge as a result, showing that distinct protocols are able to exchange global optimality similar to phase coexistence in liquid-gas phase transitions, and that increasing the positional information can lead to diminishing returns when considering increased dissipation.</p>

            <p>At the mesoscale, the avalanche-like plastic bursts are associated with statistical signatures, whose parameters are not always well defined. In this work, we performed large scale and realistic Dislocation Dynamics simulations of the deformation of fcc Cu in bulk systems under fixed strain rate. Our results show that the power law exponent is not impacted by the dislocation density nor the loading direction. However, dislocation density controls the scaling of the power law truncation in avalanche statistics and triggering stress at the origin of plastic events. The correlation between the activities of slip systems is highlighted. Our quantitative data can provide explanations for some experimental observations and help link the mesoscopic plasticity picture to larger-scale models.</p>

            <h2>Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Matrix Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arya Bangun, Oleh Melnyk, Benjamin März</p>
            <p>We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes in materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Considering dynamical scattering is fundamental in describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. In TEM, both the Bloch wave formulation and the multislice method are commonly employed to model the scattering process, but comparing these models directly is challenging. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which represents the transmission function in terms of the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method does not have a pure transmission function due to the entanglement between electron waves and the propagation function within the crystal. To address this, we propose a reformulation of the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as transmission matrix. This enables a direct comparison to the well-known scattering matrix, derived from the Bloch wave formulation, and analysis of their eigenstructures. We show theoretically that both matrices are equal, under the condition that the angles of the eigenvalues differ no more than modulo $2\pi n$ for integer $n$, and the eigenvectors of the transmission and scattering matrix are related in terms of a two-dimensional Fourier matrix. The characterization of both matrices in terms of physical parameters, such as total projected potentials, is also discussed, and we perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we show that the determinant of the transmission matrix can be used to estimate the mean inner potential.</p>

            <p>Anyons are low-dimensional quasiparticles that obey fractional statistics, hence interpolating between bosons and fermions. In two dimensions, they exist as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall states and they are believed to enable topological quantum computing. One-dimensional (1D) anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult. Here, we observe anyonic correlations, which emerge through the phenomenon of spin-charge separation, in a 1D strongly-interacting quantum gas. The required spin degree of freedom is provided by a mobile impurity, whose effective anyonic correlations are associated with an experimentally tunable statistical angle. These anyonic correlations are measured by monitoring the impurity momentum distribution, whose asymmetric feature demonstrates the transmutation of bosons via anyons to fermions. Going beyond equilibrium conditions, we study the dynamical properties of the anyonic correlations via dynamical fermionization of the anyons. Our work opens up the door to the exploration of non-equilibrium anyonic phenomena in a highly controllable setting.</p>

            <p>Quasi-one-dimensional magnets can host an ordered longitudinal spin-density wave state (LSDW) in magnetic field at low temperature, when longitudinal correlations are strengthened by Ising anisotropies. In the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet YbAlO3 this happens via Ising-like interchain interactions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of magnetization plateaux at 1/5 and 1/3 of the saturation value via thermal transport and magnetostriction measurements in YbAlO3. We present a phenomenological theory of the plateau states that describes them as islands of commensurability within an otherwise incommensurate LSDW phase and explains their relative positions within the LSDW phase and their relative extent in a magnetic field. Notably, the plateaux are stabilised by ferromagnetic interchain interactions in YbAlO3 and consistently are absent in other quasi-1D magnets such as BaCo2V2O8 with antiferromagnetic interchain interactions. We also report a sharp, step-like increase of the magnetostriction coefficient, indicating a phase transition of unknown origin in the high-field phase just below the saturation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alaska Subedi</p>
            <p>Layered nickelates are believed to exhibit superconductivity similar to that found in the cuprates. However, the precise crystal structure of the superconducting phase of the layered nickelates has not been fully clarified. Here, I use first principles calculations to study the pressure dependence of the structural instabilities in the single-layer-trilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which is one member of the layered nickelates family that also shows signatures of superconductivity. I find a nearly dispersionless nondegenerate phonon branch in the parent $P4/mmm$ phase that is unstable along the Brillouin zone edge $M$ $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$ $\rightarrow$ $A$ $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ at all investigated pressures up to 30 GPa. Calculations show additional doubly-degenerate instabilities along the edge $MA$ at lower pressures. I used group-theoretical analysis to identify the distinct low-symmetry distortions possible due to these instabilities and generated them using the eigenvectors of the unstable modes. Structural relaxations show that the lowest energy structures at 0 and 10 GPa involve condensation of both the nondegenerate and doubly-degenerate instabilities, which is in contrast to the experimental refinements that involve condensation of only the doubly-degenerate branch. I also find that structural distortions are energetically favorable at 20 GPa, contrary to the experiments that do not observe any distortions of the parent $P4/mmm$ structure at high pressures.</p>

            <p>The bulk phase of transition metal nitrides (TMNs) has long been a subject of extensive investigation due to their utility as coating materials, electrocatalysts, and diffusion barriers, attributed to their high conductivity and refractory properties. Downscaling TMNs into two-dimensional (2D) forms would provide valuable members to the existing 2D materials repertoire, with potential enhancements across various applications. Moreover, calculations have anticipated the emergence of uncommon physical phenomena in TMNs at the 2D limit. In this study, we use the atomic substitution approach to synthesize 2D W5N6 with tunable thicknesses from tens of nanometers down to 2.9 nm. The obtained flakes exhibit high crystallinity and smooth surfaces. Electrical measurements on 15 samples show an average electrical conductivity of 161.1 S/cm, which persists while thickness decreases from 45.6 nm to 2.9 nm. The observed weak gate tuning effect suggests the semimetallic nature of the synthesized 2D W5N6. Further investigation into the conversion mechanism elucidates the crucial role of chalcogen vacancies in the precursor for initiating the reaction and strain in propagating the conversion. Our work introduces a desired semimetallic crystal to the 2D material library with mechanistic insights for future design of the synthesis.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Audrey A. Watkins, Osama R. Bilal</p>
            <p>Simple local interactions can cause primitive building blocks to self-assemble into complex and functional patterns. However, even for a small number of blocks, there exist a vast number of possible configurations that are plausible, stable, and with varying degree of order. The ability to dynamically shift between multi-stable patterns (i.e., reprogram the self-assembly) entails navigating an intractable search space, which remains a challenge. In this paper, we engineer the self-assembly of macroscopic magnetic particles to create metamaterials with dynamically reversible emergent phases. We utilize a boundary composed of magnetic hinges to confine free-floating magnetic disks into different stable assemblies. We exploit the non-destructive nature of the magnetic boundaries to create re-programmable two-dimensional metamaterials that morphs from crystalline to quasi-crystalline to disordered assembly using the same number of disks and boundary. Furthermore, we explore their utility to control the propagation of sound waves in an effectively undamped media with rich nonlinearities. Our findings can expand the metamaterials horizon into functional and tunable devices.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic magnetic response in ABA type trilayered systems and compensation phenomenon</h2>

            <p>Dynamic magnetic response in a trilayered structure with non-equivalent layers (ABA type) has been studied with Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis algorithm. In each layer, ferromagnetic (FM) nearest neighbour Ising interactions are present along with antiferromagnetic (AFM) nearest neighbour coupling across different layers. The system is studied under a harmonically oscillating external magnetic field. It is revealed that along with dynamic phase transition (DPT), compensation phenomenon emerges in this system under dynamic scenario too. This feature in dynamic case is unique for such trilayered systems only, in contrast to the bulk system reported earlier. The temporal behaviour of the magnetisation of each individual layer shows that different magnetic response of the non-equivalent layers results into such dynamic compensation phenomenon. The difference in response also results into warping of the dynamic hysteresis loops, under various external parameter values, such as amplitude of the oscillating field and temperature.</p>

            <h2>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haifeng Tang, Shreya Vardhan, Jinzhao Wang</p>
            <p>We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times. Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jose Soto Garcia, Natalia Chepiga</p>
            <p>Quantum phase transitions are characterised by the universal scaling laws in the critical region surrounding the transitions. This universality is also manifested in the critical real-time dynamics through the quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In recent experiments on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism has been used to probe the nature of quantum phase transitions. In this paper we analyze the caveats associated with this method and develop strategies to improve its accuracy. Focusing on two minimal models -- transverse-field Ising and three-state Potts -- we study the effect of boundary conditions, the location of the endpoints and some subtleties in the definition of the kink operators. In particular, we show that the critical scaling of the most intuitive types of kinks is extremely sensitive to the correct choice of endpoint, while more advanced types of kinks exhibit remarkably robust universal scaling. Furthermore, we show that when kinks are tracked over the entire chain, fixed boundary conditions improve the accuracy of the scaling. Surprisingly, the Kibble-Zurek critical scaling appears to be equally accurate whether the fixed boundary conditions are chosen to be symmetric or anti-symmetric. Finally, we show that the density of kinks extracted in the central part of long chains obeys the predicted universal scaling for all types of boundary conditions.</p>

            <p>The finite time operation of a quantum Otto heat engine leads to a trade-off between efficiency and output power, which is due to the deviation of the system from the adiabatic path. This trade-off caveat can be bypassed by using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol.

We investigated its performance using the shortcut-to-adiabaticity technique via counter-adiabatic driving with the inclusion of the cost to perform the shortcut. We use two different metrics that incorporate the cost of shortcut-to-adiabaticity to define engine efficiency and experimentally analyze which one is more appropriate for the NMR platform. We found a significant improvement in the performance of the quantum Otto heat engine driven by shortcut-to-adiabaticity, as compared to the non-adiabatic heat engine.</p>

            <p>Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</p>

            <p>We obtain the first analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-based diffusion models can generate highly creative images that lie far from their training data. But optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in a fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, equivariant local score (ELS) machine that, (3) without any training can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like ResNets and UNets) with high accuracy (median $r^2$ of $0.90, 0.91, 0.94$ on CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST). Our ELS machine reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic model of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches in different image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled UNets (median $r^2 \sim 0.75$ on CIFAR10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.</p>

            <p>Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-Ångström probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.</p>

We train a deep learning model to predict emittance growth from experimentally accessible Ronchigrams. Both simulation and experimental results show the model can capture the emittance variation with aberration coefficients accurately. We further demonstrate the model can act as a fast-executing function for the global optimization of the lens parameters. Our approach enables new ways to quickly quantify and automate aberration correction that takes advantage of the rapid measurements possible with high-speed electron cameras.

            <p>We investigate thermal and nonthermal quantum correlations in the one dimensional spin 1 bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model. Using tools from quantum information theory such as generalized concurrence, negativity, and various measures of quantum, classical, and total correlations in bipartite states we demonstrate that these measures effectively identify quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at critical points. Our negativity analysis reveals nearly identical results at zero or very low temperatures. Importantly, we find that partial concurrence, defined with the reduced density matrix, detects more quantum critical points than total concurrence. Additionally, we argue that spin chains with an odd number of spins are more effective than those with an even number in identifying QPTs.</p>

            <h2>Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jianing Li, Weiyao Ke</p>
            <p>Transport properties of cold and dense nucleon matter are important for both nuclear and astrophysics but are relatively less studied than those at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta>0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</p>

            <p>Investigating the dynamics of learning in machine learning algorithms is of paramount importance for understanding how and why an approach may be successful. The tools of physics and statistics provide a robust setting for such investigations. Here we apply concepts from random matrix theory to describe stochastic weight matrix dynamics, using the framework of Dyson Brownian motion. We derive the linear scaling rule between the learning rate (step size) and the batch size, and identify universal and non-universal aspects of weight matrix dynamics. We test our findings in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian Restricted Boltzmann Machine and in a linear one-hidden-layer neural network.</p>

            <h2>Cascading from $\mathscr{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory to Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Adjoint QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric D'Hoker, Thomas T. Dumitrescu, Efrat Gerchkovitz, Emily Nardoni</p>
            <p>We argue that adjoint QCD in 3+1 dimensions, with any $SU(N)$ gauge group and two Weyl fermion flavors (i.e. one adjoint Dirac fermion), confines and spontaneously breaks its chiral symmetries via the condensation of a fermion bilinear. We flow to this theory from pure $\mathscr{N}=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with the same gauge group, by giving a SUSY-breaking mass $M$ to the scalars in the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ vector multiplet. This flow can be analyzed rigorously at small $M$, where it leads to a deconfined vacuum at the origin of the $\mathscr{N}=2$ Coulomb branch. The analysis can be extended to all $M$ using an Abelian dual description that arises from the $N$ multi-monopole points of the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ theory. At each such point, there are $N-1$ hypermultiplet Higgs fields $h_m^{i = 1, 2}$, which are $SU(2)_R$ doublets. We provide a detailed study of the phase diagram as a function of $M$, by analyzing the semi-classical phases of the dual using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. The result is a cascade of first-order phase transitions, along which the Higgs fields $h_m^i$ successively turn on, and which interpolates between the Coulomb branch at small $M$, where all $h_m^i = 0$, and a maximal Higgs branch, where all $h_m^i \neq 0$, at sufficiently large $M$. We show that this maximal Higgs branch precisely matches the confining and chiral symmetry breaking phase of two-flavor adjoint QCD, including its broken and unbroken symmetries, its massless spectrum, and the expected large-$N$ scaling of various observables. The spontaneous breaking pattern $SU(2)_R \to U(1)_R$, consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem, is ensured by an intricate alignment mechanism for the $h_m^i$ in the dual, and leads to a $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ sigma model of increasing radius along the cascade.</p>

            <h2>Universal hyper-scaling relations, power-law tails, and data analysis for strong anomalous diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jürgen Vollmer, Claudio Giberti, Jordan Orchard, Hannes Reinhard, Carlos Mejía-Monasterio, Lamberto Rondoni</p>
            <p>Strong anomalous diffusion is {often} characterized by a piecewise-linear spectrum of the moments of displacement. The spectrum is characterized by slopes $\xi$ and $\zeta$ for small and large moments, respectively, and by the critical moment $\alpha$ of the crossover. The exponents $\xi$ and $\zeta$ characterize the asymptotic scaling of the bulk and the tails of the probability distribution function of displacements, respectively. Here, we adopt asymptotic theory to match the behaviors at intermediate scales. The resulting constraint explains how distributions with algebraic tails imply strong anomalous diffusion, and it relates $\alpha$ to the corresponding power law. Our theory provides novel relations between exponents characterizing strong anomalous diffusion, and it yields explicit expressions for the leading-order corrections to the asymptotic power-law behavior of the moments of displacement. They provide the time scale that must be surpassed to clearly discriminate the leading-order power law from its sub-leading corrections. This insight allows us to point out sources of systematic errors in their numerical estimates. Rather than separately fitting an exponent for each moment we devise a robust scheme to determine $\xi$, $\zeta$ and $\alpha$. The findings are supported by numerical and analytical results on five different models exhibiting strong anomalous diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Envelope presentation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Bin Chen</p>
            <p>Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</p>

            <h2>The Casimir Effect in (3+1)-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: the unexpected universality of quarkiton and glueton boundary states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim N. Chernodub, Vladimir A. Goy, Alexander V. Molochkov, Konstantin R. Pak, Alexey S. Tanashkin</p>
            <p>In our earlier work on the Casimir effect in (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we identified two novel nonperturbative states arising in QCD with boundaries: the glueton and the quarkiton. The glueton, or "gluon exciton", is a colorless bound state formed by gluons interacting with their negatively colored images in a chromometallic mirror. The quarkiton, or "quark exciton", is a meson-like state comprising a heavy quark attracted to its image through the mirror. In this study, we extend our analysis to finite temperatures near the deconfinement phase transition $(T \approx 0.78 T_c)$, where we observe a linear potential between a color-neutral chromometallic mirror and a heavy test quark. Our result suggests that the quarkiton state can have a physical relevance since mirrors for photons and, presumably, gluons can be realized in field theories as domain-wall solutions. Furthermore, we find a striking universality: the ratio of the glueton mass to the bulk $0^{++}$ glueball mass - defining the bulk mass gap - matches the ratio of the quarkiton string tension to the string tension between quark and anti-quark in the absence of the mirror, with a value $\mathcal{R} = 0.294(11)$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuho Sekikawa, Hiroshi Watanabe</p>
            <p>The number of users on social media continues to increase during the growth phase. Still, eventually, the number of new users balances out the number of departing users, and the number of users becomes almost constant. To investigate how network properties change under these conditions, we study the aging behavior of the network. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab'asi model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We defined $\alpha$ as the node deletion parameter and $\beta$ as the node addition parameter. The larger $\alpha$ yields, the higher the probability of deleting a node with a larger degree, and the larger $\beta$ yields, the higher the probability of connecting to a node with a larger degree and fitness. We found that the network cannot reach a steady state in some parameter regions. We investigated the degree distribution of the network that reached a steady state. The scale-free nature of the network broke down in regions where $\alpha$ is large and $\beta$ is small, and the degree distribution became exponential. We also performed percolation analyses. While the phase transition point was zero in the scale-free network, the phase transition point changed finitely in regions with large $\alpha$ and small $\beta$. The phase diagram of whether the degree distribution is power-law or exponential and whether the phase transition point of percolation is zero or finite exhibits a good agreement between the phase boundaries. This study is expected to help control network structure in mature networks.</p>

            <h2>Parametrized topological phases in 1d and T-duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roman Geiko</p>
            <p>There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space, even if each system in the family belongs to the trivial phase. The obstruction is measured by higher Berry class. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We use the generalized matrix-product states to describe RG fixed points of all translation invariant pure splits states on spin chains. Families of such fixed points correspond to bundles of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. There exists a global MPS parametrization of the family if and only if the latter bundle is trivial. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes. Mathematically, the T-duality is realized by gauging the circle action on the continuous trace algebra generated by parametrized matrix-product tensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>We study the surface code under the most general single-qubit $X$-error channel, encompassing both coherent and incoherent errors. We develop a statistical mechanics mapping for the decoding problem and represent the partition function as a transfer-matrix, i.e., a (1+1)$D$ hybrid quantum circuit. The relevant circuit evolution, as we show, has an efficient matrix product state approximation, using which we develop an algorithm for large-scale syndrome sampling, thus enabling the simulation of these non-Pauli errors away from the limits captured by previous methods. Using these results, we compute maximum-likelihood thresholds and show that error coherence has negligible influence away from the fully coherent limit. We also study how coherence impacts information-theoretic measures like the coherent information, which we show to require, for accurate threshold estimates, increasingly large codes upon increasing error coherence and to eventually break down in the fully coherent limit. To interpret the dominant effect of incoherent errors in large codes, we develop a phenomenological errorfield double field theory, which indicates the instability of coherent errors' above-threshold quasi-long-range order to the above-threshold disorder characteristic of bit-flip errors and the suppression of coherence in the logical noise channel.</p>

            <p>Any local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) has a corresponding "universal" relevant deformation that takes it to a gapped phase. This deformation preserves all continuous internal symmetries, $\mathcal{S}$, and therefore also preserves any 't Hooft anomalies supported purely in $\mathcal{S}$. We describe the resulting phase diagram in the case of SCFTs that arise as the endpoints of renormalization group flows from 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Abelian gauge theories with any number of $U(1)$ gauge group factors and arbitrary integer charges for the matter fields. We argue that the universal deformations take these QFTs to Abelian fractional quantum Hall states in the infrared (IR), and we explain how to match 't Hooft anomalies between the non-topological ultraviolet theories and the IR topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). Along the way, we give a proof that 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror symmetry of our Abelian gauge theories descends to a duality of these TQFTs. Finally, using our anomaly matching discussion, we describe how to connect, via the renormalization group, abstract local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs with certain 't Hooft anomalies for their internal symmetries to IR phases (partially) described by Abelian spin Chern-Simons theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco Aldo Venturelli, Sreetama Das, Filippo Caruso</p>
            <p>Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) ideal for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, and is highly successful for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). It has been observed that the optimal variational parameters obtained from one instance of a COP can be transferred to another instance, producing sufficiently satisfactory solutions for the latter. In this context, a suitable method for further improving the solution is to fine-tune a subset of the transferred parameters. We numerically explore the role of optimizing individual QAOA layers in improving the approximate solution of the Max-Cut problem after parameter transfer. We also investigate the trade-off between a good approximation and the required optimization time when optimizing transferred QAOA parameters. These studies show that optimizing a subset of layers can be more effective at a lower time-cost compared to optimizing all layers.</p>

            <p>To make efficient use of limited physical resources, the brain must match its coding and computational strategies to the statistical structure of input signals. An attractive testing ground for these principles is the problem of motion estimation in the fly visual system: we understand the optics of the compound eye, have a quantitative description of input signals and noise from the retina, and can record from output neurons that encode estimates of different velocity components. Furthermore, recent work provides a nearly complete wiring diagram of the intervening circuitry. What is missing is a characterization of the visual signals and motions that flies encounter in a natural context. We attack this directly with the development of a specialized camera that matches the high temporal resolution, optical properties, and spectral sensitivity of the fly's eye; inertial motion sensors provide ground truth about rotations and translations through the world. We describe the design, construction, and performance characteristics of this FlEye camera. To illustrate the opportunities created by this instrument we use data on movies and motion to construct optimal local motion estimators that can be compared with the responses of the fly's motion sensitive neurons.</p>

By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</p>

            <p>We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity, in light of recent developments on the EFT of dissipative hydrodynamics (HydroEFT). Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. A key aspect of dynamical gravity is that gravity couples to all degrees of freedom universally, hence the EFT has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the environment to which the energy escapes from the dissipative system of interest. We incorporate this effect by modeling the environment based on HydroEFT, assuming validity of the derivative expansion of the environment sector. For illustration, we apply our EFT recipe to a dissipative scalar field coupled to dynamical gravity that can be used, e.g., for dissipative inflation. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics.</p>

            <p>Quantum chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions admits a finite non-invertible symmetry described mathematically by a fusion category. This symmetry is spontaneously broken at long distances, leading to distinct vacua. When the theory has a mass gap, the spectrum is therefore characterized by particle excitations above a single vacuum and soliton sectors interpolating between vacua. We use anyon condensation and the representation theory of fusion categories to obtain exact results about this spectrum, exhibiting the allowed multiplets. Often, particles and solitons are in the same representation and therefore must have equal masses. Furthermore, the fusion category symmetry frequently implies the existence of certain stable states in the spectrum. The resulting degeneracies are encoded in quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are excited states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rainer Engelken, Michael Monteforte, Fred Wolf</p>
            <p>Nerve impulses, the currency of information flow in the brain, are generated by an instability of the neuronal membrane potential dynamics. Neuronal circuits exhibit collective chaos that appears essential for learning, memory, sensory processing, and motor control. However, the factors controlling the nature and intensity of collective chaos in neuronal circuits are not well understood. Here we use computational ergodic theory to demonstrate that basic features of nerve impulse generation profoundly affect collective chaos in neuronal circuits. Numerically exact calculations of Lyapunov spectra, Kolmogorov-Sinai-entropy, and upper and lower bounds on attractor dimension show that changes in nerve impulse generation in individual neurons moderately impact information encoding rates but qualitatively transform phase space structure. Specifically, we find a drastic reduction in the number of unstable manifolds, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, and attractor dimension. Beyond a critical point, marked by the simultaneous breakdown of the diffusion approximation, a peak in the largest Lyapunov exponent, and a localization transition of the leading covariant Lyapunov vector, networks exhibit sparse chaos: prolonged periods of near stable dynamics interrupted by short bursts of intense chaos. Analysis of large, more realistically structured networks supports the generality of these findings. In cortical circuits, biophysical properties appear tuned to this regime of sparse chaos. Our results reveal a close link between fundamental aspects of single-neuron biophysics and the collective dynamics of cortical circuits, suggesting that nerve impulse generation mechanisms are adapted to enhance circuit controllability and information flow.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pinaki Banerjee, Bidisha Chakrabarty, Swapnamay Mondal</p>
            <p>When a system consists of a large subsystem (bath) and a small one (probe), thermalization implies induction of temperature of the bath onto the probe. If both the bath and the probe are described by same microscopic Hamiltonian, thermalization further entails that the probe imbibes the phase of the bath. We refer to this phenomenon as {\it phase thermalization}. However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is realizable when the probe and the bath are described by different microscopic Hamiltonians. We show {\it phase thermalization} is possible even when the microscopic Hamiltonians differ significantly. We provide an explicit example, where the probe is a Fermi liquid realized by a Majorana chain with $n \gg 1$ fermions per site interacting through random hopping and the bath is an incoherent metal described by another Majorana chain with $N > n$ fermions per site interacting through arbitrarily long range random four-fermion interaction. In deep infrared (\emph{i.e.} at very low energies), the probe turns into an incoherent metal, with Lyapunov spectrum and diffusion coefficient identical to the bath.</p>

            <p>The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Polymer networks which locally rotate to accommodate stresses, torques, and deformation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Grasinger</p>
            <p>Polymer network models construct the constitutive relationships of a broader polymer network from the behavior of a single polymer chain (e.g. viscoelastic response to applied forces, applied electromagnetic fields, etc.). Network models have been used for multiscale phenomena in a variety of contexts such as rubber elasticity, soft multifunctional materials, biological materials, and even the curing of polymers. For decades, a myriad of polymer network models have been developed with differing numbers of chains, arranged in different ways, and with differing symmetries. To complicate matters further, there are also competing assumptions for how macroscopic variables (e.g. deformation) are related to individual chains within the network model. In this work, we propose a simple, intuitive assumption for how the network locally rotates relative to applied loading (e.g. stresses, external fields) and show that this assumption unifies many of the disparate polymer network models--while also recovering one of the most successful models for rubber elasticity, the Arruda-Boyce $8$-chain model. The new assumption is then shown to make more intuitive predictions (than prior models) for stimuli-responsive networks with orientational energies (e.g. electroactive polymers), which is significant for shape morphing and designing high degree of freedom actuators (e.g. for soft robotics). Lastly, we unveil some surprising consequences of the new model for the phases of multistable biopolymer and semi-crystalline networks.</p>

            <h2>Continuous Wigner-Mott transition at $\nu=1/5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas G. Kiely, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>Electrons can organize themselves into charge-ordered states to minimize the effects of long-ranged Coulomb interactions. In the presence of a lattice, commensurability constraints lead to the emergence of incompressible Wigner-Mott insulators at various rational electron fillings, $\nu~=p/q$. The mechanism for quantum fluctuation-mediated melting of the Mott insulators with increasing electron kinetic energy remains an outstanding problem. Here, using matrix product state techniques, we analyze the bandwidth-tuned transition out of the Wigner-Mott insulator at $\nu=1/5$ in an extended Hubbard model on infinite cylinders of varying circumference. For the two-leg ladder, the transition from the Mott insulator to the Luttinger liquid proceeds via a distinct intermediate phase with gapless Cooper-pairs and gapped electronic excitations. The resulting Luther-Emery liquid is the analog of a strongly fluctuating superconductor. We place these results in the context of a low-energy bosonization based theory for the transition. On the five-leg cylinder, we provide numerical evidence for a direct continuous transition between the Wigner-Mott insulator and a metallic phase across which the spin and charge-gaps vanish simultaneously. We comment on the connections to ongoing experiments in dual-gated bilayer moiré transition metal dichalcogenide materials.</p>

            <h2>Collective epithelial migration mediated by the unbinding of hexatic defects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Krommydas, Livio Nicola Carenza, Luca Giomi</p>
            <p>Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: a local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to swap their positions. Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingyao Meng, Runyu Ma, Tianxing Ma, Hai-Qing Lin</p>
            <p>Superconductivity in single-layer graphene has attracted considerable interest. Here, using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we study transitions of superconductivity and magnetism in a monolayer graphene with a special periodic strain. Consistent with experiments, the deformation accumulates a series of flat bands, whose robustness under interaction is verified through electron localization in real space. During the reconstruction of the band structure, the superconductivity appears in flat band range with next-nearest neighbor $d+id$ pairing symmetry dominating other modes and is accompanied by ferromagnetism caused by symmetry breaking. We also demonstrate that the strain-induced symmetry breaking would accumulate an energy-gap antiferromagnetic insulating phase at half filling even under the limitation of not strong enough interaction, which shows its potential as a platform that exhibits strongly correlated phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Wen Yu, Bang-Gui Liu</p>
            <p>2D materials can host interesting physics and have important applications in various fields. Recent experiment shows that monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoflakes with neutral zigzag edges are stable. Here, we study semiconducting stoichiometric PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons with the stable neutral zigzag edges (with $N$ describing different nanoribbon width) through combining detailed first-principles investigation with low-energy model analysis. Our careful analysis of first-principles conduction and valence bands (with the spin-orbits coupling taken into account) indicates that the low-energy bands assume relativistic energy dispersion in an energy window of [-0.2 eV, 0.2eV] (at least) and have large unconventional Rashba spin splitting (for even $N$). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the low-energy bands can be well described by an effective one-dimensional electron model and the semiconductor gap will remain finite even for large $N$. Most importantly, it is shown that there exists SU(2) spin symmetry in both of the conduction and valence bands for each edge, which implies persistent spin helices (in the spin xy plane) and spin-conserving carrier transport. When the inter-edge interaction becomes weak ($N$ is large enough), a nearly-perfect Dirac fermion system can be achieved through combining the valence and conduction bands. Thus we realize unconventional Rashba splitting, double SU(2) spin symmetry, persistent spin helices/textures, and pure Dirac fermion systems in stable monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giuseppe Lovarelli, Fabrizio Mazziotti, Demetrio Logoteta, Giuseppe Iannaccone</p>
            <p>Reducing the contact resistance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional materials is one of the key improvements required to enable the integration of such transistors in an advanced semiconductor manufacturing process. Suitably designed lateral heterojunctions provide an opportunity to independently tailor the contact and channel properties in order to optimize contact resistance. Inspired by the recent experimental demonstration of a two-dimensional $p$-type Schottky barrier, here we use quantum transport simulations to estimate the performance of $p$-type transistors in which the channel consists of a lateral heterostructure of NbS$_2$/MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ (semimetal-semiconductor-semimetal). We find that the gate alignment with the channel is a critical design parameter, strongly influencing the capability of the gate to modulate the Schottky barrier at the MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ interface. This effect is also found to significantly affect the scaling behavior of the device.</p>

            <h2>Phase Switch Driven by the Hidden Half-Ice, Half-Fire State in a Ferrimagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiguo Yin, A. M. Tsvelik</p>
            <p>The notion of "half fire, half ice" was recently introduced to describe an exotic macroscopic ground-state degeneracy emerging in a ferrimagnet under the critical magnetic field, in which the "hot" spins are fully disordered on the sublattice with smaller magnetic moments and the "cold" spins are fully ordered on the sublattice with larger magnetic moments. Here we further point out that this state has a twin named "half ice, half fire" in which the hot and cold spins switch positions. The new state is an excited state -- thus hidden in the ground-state phase diagram -- and is robust with respect to the interactions that destroy the half fire, half ice state. We demonstrate with exact results how this hidden state can drive phase switching at desirable finite temperature, even for the one-dimensional Ising model where phase transition at finite temperature is forbidden. We suggest that our findings may open a new door to the understanding and controlling of phase competition and transition in unconventional frustrated systems.</p>

            <p>The kinetics of dislocation reactions, such as dislocation multiplication, controls the plastic deformation in crystals beyond their elastic limit, therefore critical mechanisms in a number of applications in materials science. We present a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that shows that one such type of reactions, the nucleation of dislocation at free surfaces, exhibit extremely unconventional kinetics, including unexpectedly large nucleation rates under compression, very strong entropic stabilization under tension, as well as strong non-Arrhenius behavior. These unusual kinetics are quantitatively rationalized using a variational transition state theory approach coupled with an efficient numerical scheme for the estimation of vibrational entropy changes. These results highlight the need for a variational treatment of the kinetics to quantitatively capture dislocation reaction kinetics, especially at low-to-moderate strains where large deformations are required to activate reactions. These observations suggest possible explanations to previously observed unconventional deformation kinetics in both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atri Goswami, Rohn Chatterjee, Sudip Mukherjee</p>
            <p>Totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) sets the paradigm for one-dimensional driven single file motion. We study a periodic TASEP with two ``road blocks'' or defects of different kinds, one point and another extended, across which particle flows are inhibited. We show how the interplay between particle number conservation and competition between the defects lead to inhomogeneous steady states with localised domain walls (LDW). The LDW locations jump discontinuously, indicating a discontinuous transition between these LDW states, as the system passes from being controlled by one defect to the other. When the defects are ``competing'', instead of an LDW a pair of delocalised domain walls appear, none of which can penetrate the extended defect. A minimum current principle can be used to identify the dominant defect that controls the domain wall formations. Our results should be important in diverse systems, ranging from protein synthesis by ribosomes in biological cells to urban traffic networks.</p>

            <h2>Universal energy-speed-accuracy trade-offs in driven nonequilibrium systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jérémie Klinger, Grant M. Rotskoff</p>
            <p>Physical systems driven away from equilibrium by an external controller dissipate heat to the environment; the excess entropy production in the thermal reservoir can be interpreted as a "cost" to transform the system in a finite time. The connection between measure theoretic optimal transport and dissipative nonequilibrium dynamics provides a language for quantifying this cost and has resulted in a collection of "thermodynamic speed limits", which argue that the minimum dissipation of a transformation between two probability distributions is directly proportional to the rate of driving. Thermodynamic speed limits rely on the assumption that the target probability distribution is perfectly realized, which is almost never the case in experiments or numerical simulations. Here, we address the ubiquitous situation in which the external controller is imperfect. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for the dissipated work in generic nonequilibrium control problems that 1) is asymptotically tight and 2) matches the thermodynamic speed limit in the case of optimal driving. We illustrate these bounds on analytically solvable examples and also develop a strategy for optimizing minimally dissipative protocols based on optimal transport flow matching, a generative machine learning technique. This latter approach ensures the scalability of both the theoretical and computational framework we put forth. Crucially, we demonstrate that we can compute the terms in our bound numerically using efficient algorithms from the computational optimal transport literature and that the protocols that we learn saturate the bound.</p>

            <h2>Numerical study of neutral and charged microgel suspensions: from single-particle to collective behavior</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giovanni Del Monte, Emanuela Zaccarelli</p>
            <p>We perform extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of an ensemble of realistic microgel particles in swollen conditions in a wide range of packing fractions $\zeta$. We compare neutral and charged microgels, where we consider charges distribution adherent to experimental conditions. Through a detailed analysis of single-particle behavior, we are able to identify the different regimes occurring upon increasing concentration: from shrinking to deformation and interpenetration, always connecting our findings to available experimental observations. We then link these single-particle features to the collective behavior of the suspension, finding evidence of a structural reentrance, that has no counterpart in the dynamics. Hence, while the maximum of the radial distribution function displays a non-monotonic behavior with increasing $\zeta$, the dynamics, quantified by the microgels' mean-squared displacement, always slows down. This behavior, at odds with simple Hertzian model, can be described by a phenomenological multi-Hertzian, which takes into account the enhanced internal stiffness of the core. However, also this model fails when deformation enters into play, whereby more realistic many-body models are required. We are able to unveil the key physical mechanisms, shrinking and deformation, giving rise to the structural reentrance that holds up to very large packing fractions. We further identify key similarities and differences between neutral and charged microgels, for which we detect at high enough $\zeta$ the fusion of charged shells, previously invoked to explain key experimental findings, and responsible for the structural reentrance. Overall, our study establishes a powerful framework to uncover the physics of microgel suspensions, paving the way to tackle different regimes and internal structural architectures, where experimental evidence is still limited.</p>

In particular, the magnon spin current is dominated by electric field component which perpendicular to the magnetization direction. We apply our theory to 1D ferromagnetic SSH model and show that the generated magnon spin current is closely related to the band geometry. Our findings expands the horizons of magnonics and electric-control-magnon mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The anharmonic phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction to be approached, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p>Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</p>

            <p>The discovery of a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and its novel mechanism holds significant promise for advancing both fundamental research and practical applications. Magnetic kagome lattice materials are uniquely suited for studying the AHE due to their interplay between electronic structure, topology, and magnetism. However, the geometric frustration inherent in kagome lattices often limits the configuration and tunability of magnetic order. Here, we present a new design strategy for kagome-lattice materials with emergent magnetism, exemplified by the magnetic kagome metal TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which features interwoven magnetic Tb zigzag chains and non-magnetic Ti kagome bilayers. This material exhibits a record-high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 10$^5$ $\Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$. Spectroscopy measurements reveal a large band folding gap observed via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, coexisting spin-density-wave (SDW) order detected through spin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy, and a spiral magnetic order with large magnetic moments identified by neutron diffraction. These findings highlight a strong electron-magnetic coupling between itinerant charges and ordered magnetic moments, offering a spectroscopic explanation for the giant AHC in TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$. This work establishes a pathway for innovative material design strategies, unlocking new possibilities for future exploration and applications in quantum and spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>$\beta$-Tungsten ($\beta$-W), an A15 cubic phase of tungsten, exhibits a giant spin Hall angle compared to its bcc-phase $\alpha$-Tungsten ($\alpha$-W), making high-quality $\beta$-W films desirable for spintronic applications. We report the controlled growth of $\beta$-W films on SiO$_2$/Si substrates via DC sputtering, where substrate bias serves as a critical factor in stabilizing the $\beta$ phase by regulating the energy of deposited atoms. This approach enables the formation of $\beta$-W films over a wide thickness range. Additionally, we studied the spin pumping phenomena in different tungsten phases achieved through substrate bias. Ferromagnetic resonance measurements reveal an enhancement in the magnetic damping (\( \alpha_{\text{eff}} \)) for $\beta$-W/Py compared to $\alpha$-W/Py dominated film. The effective spin mixing conductance (\( g_{\text{eff}}^{\uparrow\downarrow} \)) is found to be higher in $\beta$-W/Py than in $\alpha$-W/Py, which is attributed to variations in the interface structures between these phases. Importantly, the use of substrate bias does not deteriorate the interface quality, underscoring its effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of substrate bias in thin-film engineering, paving the way for its advanced utilization in spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>The Holstein model on a square lattice at half-filling has a well-established finite temperature phase transition to an insulating state with long range charge density wave (CDW) order. Because this CDW formation suppresses pairing, a superconducting (SC) phase emerges only with doping. In this work, we study the effects of dilution of the local phonon degrees of freedom in the Holstein model while keeping the system at half filling. We find not only that the CDW remains present up to a dilution fraction $f \sim 0.15$, but also that long range pairing is stabilized with increasing $f$, resulting in a {\it supersolid} regime centered at $f \approx 0.10$, where long range diagonal and off-diagonal correlations coexist. Further dilution results in a purely SC phase, and ultimately in a normal metal. Our results provide a new route to the supersolid phase via the introduction of impurities at fixed positions which both increase quantum fluctuations and also are immune to the competing tendency to phase separation often observed in the doped case.</p>

            <p>The interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations can induce rich phenomena at finite temperatures in strongly correlated fermion systems. Here we report a {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) study for the finite-temperature properties of three-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model at half filling. We concentrate on the complete temperature-interaction strength phase diagram of the model, which contains the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range ordered phase and metal-insulator crossover (MIC) in the paramagnetic phase. Enabling access to unprecedented system sizes up to $20^3$, we achieve highly accurate results of the Néel transition temperature for representative values of on-site interaction $U$ via finite-size analysis of AFM structure factor. To quantitatively characterize the MIC above the Néel transition, we have developed fully new techniques allowing to compute the thermal entropy versus $U$ at fixed temperature and to directly calculate the $U$-derivative of double occupancy in AFQMC simulations. Then combining variously thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish an efficient scheme to precisely determine the boundaries for the MIC by cross-checking different observables. We also demonstrate the temperature dependence of many commonly used observables. Away from half filling, we explore the behavior of the sign problem and AFM spin correlation versus hole doping, and demonstrate the persistance of Néel AFM ordered phase to finite doping with limited results.</p>

            <p>In this work, it is shown that improvements can be introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas to take into account the quantum nature of phase space, which is related to the uncertainty principle. The construction of the improved models is based on the use of the concepts of phase space representation of quantum mechanics and quantum phase space that were introduced and developed recently. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and the use of quantum statistical mechanics leads to the deduction of the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas itself. The explicit expressions of thermodynamic quantities such as the grand canonical potential, the thermodynamic particle number, the internal energy, the Von Neumann entropy, and the pressure, as well as the thermodynamic state equations corresponding to the improved models, are established for both bosons and fermions. The corrections introduced by these expressions are expected to be particularly significant at low temperatures and for confined volumes. They allow for the highlighting of quantum shape and size effects. It is also shown that the thermodynamic functions and variables are directly related to the quantum statistical variances of the momenta. Well-known relations corresponding to the classical ideal gas model can be recovered from the improved models as asymptotic limits at high temperatures and for large volumes.</p>

For $n \to \infty$, $1/v_n(\vec{r}) = u_{n-1}(\vec{r})/u_{n}(\vec{r})$ converges to the lowest eigenenergy $E_1$ of ${\hat H}$ whereas $u_{\infty}(\vec{r})$ yields the corresponding wave function $\psi_1(\vec{r})$. For large but finite $n$, $v_n(\vec{r})$ can be approximated by a piecewise constant function $v_n(\vec{r}) \simeq v_n^{(m)}$ for $\vec{r} \in \Omega_m$ and yields progressively improving estimations of eigenenergies $E_m = 1/v_n^{(m)}$ of locally fundamental eigenstates $\psi_m(\vec{r}) \propto u_{n}(\vec{r})$ in spatial domains $\Omega_m$. These general results are illustrated by a number of examples in one dimension: box potential, sequence of randomly placed infinite potential barriers, smooth and spatially uncorrelated random potentials, quasiperiodic potential, as well as for the uncorrelated random potential in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>Understanding the complete light-spin interactions in magnetic systems is the key to manipulating the magnetization using optical means at ultrafast timescales. The selective addressing of spins by terahertz (THz) electromagnetic fields via Zeeman torque is one of the most successful ultrafast means of controlling magnetic excitations. Here we show that this traditional Zeeman torque on the spins is not sufficient, rather an additional relativistic field-derivative torque is essential to realize the observed magnetization dynamics. We accomplish this by exploring the ultrafast nonlinear magnetization dynamics of rare-earth, Bi-doped iron garnet when excited by two co-propagating THz pulses. First, by exciting the sample with an intense THz pulse and probing the magnetization dynamics using magneto-optical Faraday effect, we find the collective exchange resonance mode between rare-earth and transition metal sublattices at 0.48 THz. We further explore the magnetization dynamics via the THz time-domain spectroscopic means. We find that the observed nonlinear trace of the magnetic response cannot be mapped to the magnetization precession induced by the Zeeman torque, while the Zeeman torque supplemented by an additional field-derivative torque follows the experimental evidences. This breakthrough enhances our comprehension of ultra-relativistic effects and paves the way towards novel technologies harnessing light-induced control over magnetic systems.</p>

The impact of shape on the behavior of confined systems is significantly different from that of size, making it an emerging area of research. The recent realization of flat-bottomed optical box traps has further contributed to the study of quantum gases in complex confinement geometries. Here, we propose shape-induced Bose-Einstein condensation at a fixed size, temperature, and density. We investigate the impact of pure quantum shape effects on a non-interacting Bose gas confined within nested square domains, where the shape parameter is defined and controlled by the rotation angle between the inner and outer squares. Our findings reveal that specific heat exhibits an additional low-temperature peak at certain shapes. This work opens new avenues for controlling quantum systems through geometric manipulation and provides insights into the thermodynamic properties of Bose gases under shape-induced quantum effects.</p>

            <p>We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by multiple superconductors and discover the emergence of exceptional points entirely determined by the interplay of the distinct superconducting phases and non-Hermiticity due to normal reservoirs. In particular, in Josephson junctions with three and four superconductors, we find stable lines and surfaces of exceptional points protected by non-Hermitian topology and highly tuneable by the superconducting phases. We also discover that, in Josephson junctions formed by laterally coupled superconductors, exceptional points can result from hybridized Andreev bound states and lead to the enhancement of supercurrents controlled by dissipation. Our work unveils the potential of multi-terminal Josephson junctions for realizing higher dimensional topological non-Hermitian superconducting phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Polarizability and Tunable Diamagnetic Shifts from Charged Localized Emitters in WSe2 on a Relaxor Ferroelectric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiaohui Zhou, Fei Wang, Ali Soleymani, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jiang Wei, Xin Lu</p>
            <p>Strain modulation is a crucial way in engineering nanoscale materials. It is even more important for single photon emitters in layered materials, where strain can create quantum emitters and control their energies. Here we report the localized, charge-enhanced coupling between the charged localized emitters in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) to the piezoelectric relaxor ferroelectric substrate. In addition to the strain effect, we observe a gigantic polarizability volume with the enhancement factor up to 1010. The enormous polarizability leads to a large Quantum-confined Stark shift under a small variation of electric field, indicating the potential of integrating layered materials with functional substrates for quantum sensing. We further demonstrate the tunable diamagnetic shift and g-factor with strain varying by ~0.05%, which confirms the existence of enhanced interaction between the localized oscillating dipoles and the ferroelectric domains. Our results signify the prospect of charged quantum emitters in layered materials for quantum sciences and technology.</p>

            <h2>Josephson diodes induced by the loop current states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi-Kai Shen, Yi Zhang</p>
            <p>We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid-Order Topological Phase And Transition in 1H Transition Metal Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ning-Jing Yang, Zhigao Huang, Jian-Min Zhang</p>
            <p>Inspired by recent experimental observations of hybrid topological states [Hossain et al. Nature 628, 527 (2024)], we predict hybrid-order topological insulators in 1H transition metal compounds (TMCs), where both second-order and first-order topological (FOT) states coexist near the Fermi level. Initially, 1H-TMCs exhibit a second-order topological phase due to the d orbital bandgap. Upon coupling of p and d orbitals through the crystal field effect, first-order topological characteristics emerge. This hybrid-order topological phase transition can be tuned via crystal field effects. Combined with first-principles calculations, we illustrate the phase transition with WTe2 and NbSe2. The WTe2 exhibits hybrid-order under ambient conditions, while NbSe2 transitions to hybrid-order under pressure. Additionally, the first-order topological bandgap in the HyOTI demonstrates a strong spin Hall effect. Our findings reveal a hybrid-order topological phase in two-dimensional electron materials and underscore spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nature of density-density correlations in a 1D gas of hard-core particles initially prepared at equilibrium (either at zero or finite temperature) on a semi-infinite line and subsequently let to expand into the other (initially empty) half of the system. Using a combination of analytical techniques based on exact methods and asymptotic hydrodynamic approaches, we discuss the behavior of the gas as its initial temperature varies, and back up our derivations with numerical exact diagonalization of the model. Our findings reveal that, irrespective of the initial temperature, the non-equilibrium behavior of density-density correlations at sufficiently large times is characterized by algebraic decay. Furthermore, we provide analytical results based on quantum generalized hydrodynamics that match with the numerical data both at zero and finite temperature.</p>

            <h2>Coupled spin and valley Hall effects driven by coherent tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. Zeng</p>
            <p>We predict the coexistence of tunneling spin and valley Hall effects when electrons in graphene coherently transmit through a barrier with the broken inversion symmetry and proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. Due to the rotation of the pseudospin in the tunneling process, the transmitted electrons acquire a finite spin- and valley-dependent backreflection geometric phase when the two interfaces of the barrier are asymmetric. This results in a spin- and valley-dependent skew coherent tunneling, which is responsible for the transverse spin and valley Hall currents. We further demonstrate that the coherent-tunneling assisted charge-spin and charge-valley conversions are highly efficient with large Hall angles. Our work provides a new route for the generation of efficient spin and valley Hall effects, suggesting potential applications for spintronic and valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Among interesting applications of cold atoms, quantum simulations attract a lot of attention. In this context, rare-earth ultracold atoms are particularly appealing for such simulators due to their numerous Fano-Feshbach resonances and magnetic dipole moments in the ground state. Creating a quantum gas microscope requires a large optical access that may be achieved using transport of atoms between separate vacuum volumes. We demonstrate that in case of the transport of magnetic atoms the magnetic field can be directly measured and adjusted to reduce additional losses after the transport therefore increasing the efficiency of subsequent evaporation cooling. This approach allows to transfer over 85% of the atoms from the main chamber to the scientific chamber, located 38 cm away with moderate laser power of 26 W without atomic polarization decay.</p>

            <p>Acoustic modulation of quantum dots allows one to control the scattering of photons. Here we theoretically characterize the degree of this acoustic control in the frequency domain. We formulate the theory of low-intensity resonance fluorescence in the presence of white noise and show that a high level of control is achievable with a two-tone acoustic field for appropriate settings of modulation amplitudes as long as the noise-induced phase diffusion coefficient remains one order of magnitude smaller than the acoustic frequency. In addition, using a quantitative model of optical signal collection, we determine that the acoustic phase must be stable over $\mathbf{10^4}$ to $\mathbf{10^5}$ acoustic periods for efficient control.</p>

            <p>Collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on user-item similarities through rating data, which may involve numerous unrated items. To predict scores for unrated items, matrix factorization techniques, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), are often employed to predict scores for unrated items. Nonnegative/binary matrix factorization (NBMF), which is an extension of NMF, approximates a nonnegative matrix as the product of nonnegative and binary matrices. Previous studies have employed NBMF for image analysis where the data were dense. In this paper, we propose a modified NBMF algorithm that can be applied to collaborative filtering where data are sparse. In the modified method, unrated elements in a rating matrix are masked, which improves the collaborative filtering performance. Utilizing a low-latency Ising machine in NBMF is advantageous in terms of the computation time, making the proposed method beneficial.</p>

            <h2>Backbone Mediated Electrical Transport in a Double-Stranded DNA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Kundu, Siddhartha Lal</p>
            <p>In the field of DNA nanotechnology, it is common wisdom that charge transport occurs through the {\pi} stacked bases of double-stranded DNA. However, recent experimental findings by Zhuravel et. al. [Nat. Nanotech. 15, 836 (2020)] suggest that electronic transport happens through the backbone channels instead of {\pi}-{\pi} interaction of the nitrogen bases. These new experimental insights call for a detail investigation. In keeping with this, we examine charge transport properties of three characteristic double-stranded DNA sequences (periodic GC, periodic AT and random ATGC sequences) within a tight-binding framework where backbones form the main conduction channels. Using techniques based on the Green function method, we inspect the single-particle density of states and localization properties of DNA in the presence of discontinuities (nicks) along the backbone channels. We also investigate the effect of these nicks on current-voltage response using the Landauer - Buttiker formalism for a two-terminal geometry where the source electrode is attached to one backbone strand and the drain to the other. We observe that the periodic DNA sequence of GC bases is metallic in nature, while the periodic AT sequence and the random ATGC sequence are insulating. Further, the effects of nicks on the transport properties of the periodic GC sequence is interesting: while a single nick on the upper backbone does not affect electronic transport, the addition of a second nick on the lower backbone causes the current to vanish altogether. This is found to be robust against changes in the positions of the nicks, as well as the alternation of the source and drain electrodes.</p>

            <p>Spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are of particular interest for functional oxide electronics applications. The redox-created 2DEG residing on the strontium titanate, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), side of a europium monoxide (EuO)/SrTiO$_3$ (001) interface is expected to be significantly spin-polarized due to the proximity to the strong ($7\,\mu_B/f.u.$) Heisenberg ferromagnet EuO. We apply magnetic circular dichroism in the angular distribution (MCDAD) of photoemitted electrons to investigate whether and how the induced spin polarization of the 2DEG depends on the dimensionality of the overlaying EuO layer. The experimental data are complemented by density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term (DFT+$U$). We show that the EuO/STO interfacial 2DEG is spin-polarized even for ultrathin EuO overlayers, starting at an EuO threshold thickness of only two monolayers. Additional EuO monolayers even increase the induced magnetic Ti moment and thus the spin polarization of the 2DEG. Our results and the potential to enhance the magnetic order of EuO by other proximity effects indicate that the EuO/STO (001) interface is an ideal template for creating (multi-)functional spin-polarized 2DEGs for application in oxide electronics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semianalytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As a demonstration of their capabilities, we show that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.</p>

            <p>We consider a run-and-tumble particle moving on a half-line with a periodic force field and an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two fixed values at Poisson-distributed times. The particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics. The periodic force field is assumed to be such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation. The Laplace transform of this equation yields systems of equations satisfied by the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle reaches the origin in finite time almost surely. We calculate the exit probability of the particle, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the exit probability is less than one. If the force field is a constant drift, the condition is satisfied by positive values of the drift. The mean first-passage time of the particle (averaged over trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form in both regimes.</p>

            <p>We analyze the aggregation of locally amphiphilic copolymers with blocky architecture and uniformly distributed amphiphilic moieties in terms of a mean-field theory. Locally amphiphilic structure is characteristic of many thermoresponsive polymers, both linear and grafted, which endows them with local surface activity. Self-assembly of such copolymers exhibits a rich diversity of morphologies, which are analyzed in the present work in the limit of high surface activity of amphiphilic dimers with solvophilic/polar pendants. Depending on the composition and architecture of the copolymer and sizes and interaction parameters of the solvophilic/polar pendants, we build morphological diagrams of copolymer solutions. Copolymers with small volume pendants form precipitates or large aggregates with internal voids containing these pendants. For moderate volume pendants, a lamellar structure (or large vesicles) is observed at smaller fractions of amphiphilic monomer units in the chain and micelles are formed at larger fractions of these units. The sizes and shapes of micelles depend on the monomer distribution along the chain, and the blocky architecture favors the existence of single spherical micelles or spherical particles that constitute compound micelles. For sufficiently large polar pendants, copolymers of both types mainly form granular branched compound micelles. The distance at which adjacent hydrophobic and polar groups are located in a chain determines the size of domains and particles formed by locally amphiphilic blocks or chains. Our predictions explain the existence of dense multicore complex micelles consisting of beads of several tens of nanometers size and other structures such as disc-shaped micelles.</p>

            <p>Second-order topological superconductors host Majorana corner modes (MCMs), which are confined to specific corners of the system. This spatial restriction presents challenges for manipulating and relocating MCMs. We propose a novel protocol for dynamically controlling the movement of time-reversal symmetric MCMs in a heterostructure consisting of a 2D Weyl semimetal and a $d$-wave superconductor. By leveraging the energy asymmetry of topological edge states in the 2D Weyl semimetal, the position of MCMs can be effectively tuned via chemical potential adjustments. We further introduce a device architecture that integrates multiple heterostructure blocks, each controlled by independent gate voltages, to enable the adiabatic movement and exchange of MCMs. This approach demonstrates a robust mechanism for Majorana manipulation and provides a scalable framework for future experimental studies of topological quantum computation.</p>

Spin-valley-dependent electronic states with distinct spin textures offer potential applications in spintronic devices. Our calculations reveal helical and chiral spin texture for spin-up, and spin-down respectively, by opposing electron and hole orientation in the conduction and valence bands. The Berry curvature behavior in the vicinity of the Dirac points for different values of $\alpha$, reveals a sign change and topological phase transitions in 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$. When $\alpha<1$, the system exhibits the Quantum Spin Hall Insulator (QSHI) phase ($C_s=1$), characterized by a non-trivial gap and helical edge mode. $\alpha>1$ is responsible for a topological phase transition to the band insulator (BI) ($C_v=1$) and killing the edge modes. Also when $\alpha=1$ the Fermi energy falls within the bands, consequently, the Chern number is not defined. Calculations of spin Nernst (SNC), valley Nernst (VNC), and total Nernst coefficients (TNC) further confirm the QSHI-to-BI phase transition under varying $\alpha$ and doping. These results provide comprehensive insights into the tunable topological properties of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ and their implications for spintronic and valleytronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lunts, Aavishkar Patel, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower. Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., Phys. Rev. B 103, 155102 (2021), arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., Phys. Rev. X 12, 011037 (2022), arXiv:2106.05959).

Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting can emerge in the AB-stacking configurations. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP2S6, MnPX3 can show switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on its band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.</p>

The magnetization and heat capacity data show a lack of magnetic ordering down to 73 mK. We deploy a localized spin dimer model which can accurately reproduce the dynamic structure factor of the neutron data, magnetization and heat capacity data. Remarkably, the intra-dimer exchange interaction shows strong XY-type anisotropy and the ground state of BaCe$_2$ZnS$_5$ is in an entangled state $(|\uparrow\uparrow> - |\downarrow\downarrow>)/\sqrt{2}$. This is in contrast to the singlet dimer state that is obtained for Heisenberg interactions. These results confirm that BaCe$_2$ZnS$_5$ is in a quantum paramagnet state consisting of entangled spin dimer states.</p>

            <p>We measure the entropy change of charge transitions in an electrostatically defined quantum dot in bilayer graphene. Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a two-fold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a non-degenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a three-fold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele type spin-orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our work demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices build in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Fundamental research on two-dimensional (2D) magnetic systems based on van der Waals materials has been gaining traction rapidly since their recent discovery. With the increase of recent knowledge, it has become clear that such materials have also a strong potential for applications in devices that combine magnetism with electronics, optics, and nanomechanics. Nonetheless, many challenges still lay ahead. Several fundamental aspects of 2D magnetic materials are still unknown or poorly understood, such as their often-complicated electronic structure, optical properties, and magnetization dynamics, and their magnon spectrum. To elucidate their properties and facilitate integration in devices, advanced characterization techniques and theoretical frameworks need to be developed or adapted. Moreover, developing synthesis methods which increase critical temperatures and achieve large-scale, high-quality homogeneous thin films is crucial before these materials can be used for real-world applications. Therefore, the field of 2D magnetic materials provides many challenges and opportunities for the discovery and exploration of new phenomena, as well as the development of new applications. This Roadmap presents the background, challenges, and potential research directions for various relevant topics in the field on the fundamentals, synthesis, characterization, and applications.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huanhuan Wei, Jing Tang, Yuangang Deng</p>
            <p>High-spin quantum systems, endowed with rich internal degrees of freedom, constitute a promising platform for manipulating high-quality $n$-photon states. In this study, we explore $n$-photon bundles emission by constructing a high-spin Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) within a single-mode cavity interacting with a single spin-$3/2$ atom. Our analysis reveals that the $n$-photon dressed state splittings can be significantly enhanced by adjusting the linear Zeeman shift inherent to the internal degrees of freedom in high-spin systems, thereby yielding well-resolved $n$-photon resonance. The markedly enhanced energy-spectrum anharmonicity, stemming from strong nonlinearities, enables the realization of high-quality $n$-photon bundles emission with large steady-state photon numbers, in contrast to conventional spin-1/2 JCM setups. Of particular interest is the realization of an optical multimode transducer capable of transitioning among single-photon blockade, two- to four-photon bundles emission, and photon-induced tunneling by tuning the light-cavity detuning in the presence of both cavity and atomic pump fields. This work unveils significant opportunities for diverse applications in nonclassical all-optical switching and high-quality multiphoton sources, deepening our understanding of creating specialized nonclassical states and fundamental physics in high-spin atom-cavity systems.</p>

            <p>A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter that exhibits the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. \red{While theoretical studies have predicted that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can host a supersolid phase, experimental validation has remained elusive. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spins, we investigate the supersolid phase in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$.} Here, we present the magnetic phase diagram and neutron scattering results for K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, which features nearest-neighbor Ising-like interactions with $J_z = 2.96(2)$ meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$ meV. In zero field, neutron spectroscopy reveals the gradual development of a quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with Z$_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) below 15 K. \red{At temperatures below 0.3 K, the fully developed supersolid phase is evidenced by the coexistence of a gapless Goldstone mode arising from broken U$(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (superfluidity), and a gapped pseudo-Goldstone mode associated with lifted accidental XY degeneracy (solidity).} In $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields 1.1 T $<$ $B$ $<$ 21 T, a prominent 1/3 magnetization plateau phase emerges, accompanied by a \red{plausible} high-field supersolid phase (17 T $<$ $B$ $<$ 21 T).

            <p>This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</p>

            <p>To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space.

Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces.

            <h2>Uniquely identifying quantum Hall phases in charge neutral graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jincheng An, Ganpathy Murthy</p>
            <p>Charge-neutral graphene in the quantum Hall regime is an example of a quantum Hall ferromagnet in a complex spin-valley space. This system exhibits a plethora of phases, with the particular spin-valley order parameters chosen by the system depending sensitively on the short-range anisotropic couplings, the Zeeman field, and the sublattice symmetry breaking field. A subset of order parameters related to lattice symmetry-breaking have been observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, other order parameters, particularly those which superpose spin and valley, are more elusive, making it difficult to pin down the nature of the phase. We propose a solution this problem by examining two types of experimentally measurable quantities; transport gaps and collective mode dispersions. We find that the variation of the transport gap with the Zeeman and sublattice symmetry breaking fields, in conjunction with the number of Larmor and gapless modes, provides a unique signature for each theoretically possible phase.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Anharmonic Effects on the Superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S at High Pressures: a First-Principles Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pugeng Hou, Francesco Belli, Tiange Bi, Eva Zurek, Ion Errea</p>
            <p>Making use of first-principles calculations we analyze the effect of quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the crystal structure and superconductivity of I-43m CH4-H3S, one of the lowest enthalpy structures in the C-S-H system, in the 150-300 GPa pressure range within the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We predict a correction to the crystal structure, which is formed by an H3S lattice and CH4 molecules, the phonon spectra, and the pressure-dependent superconducting critical temperatures, which have been estimated in previous calculations without considering ionic fluctuations on the crystal structure and assuming the harmonic approximation for the lattice dynamics. Our results show that quantum ionic fluctuations have an impact on the distance between H atoms and S atoms in the H3S host lattice, pushing it towards more symmetric bonds, while the methane molecules are barely affected. According to our anharmonic phonon spectra, this structure is dynamically stable above 150 GPa, which is 30 GPa lower than the pressure at which the harmonic approximation predicts the emergence of an instability. As a consequence of the strong anharmonic enhancement of the phonon frequencies, the electron-phonon coupling constant is suppressed by 46% at 200 GPa, and even more at lower pressures. As a result, the superconducting critical temperature is overestimated by around 50 K at 200 GPa, such that it falls below 150 K in the whole pressure range studied. Our results underline that ternary hydrides are subject to strong anharmonic effects on their structural, vibrational, and superconducting properties.</p>

            <h2>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Wang, Kun Jiang, Fu-Chun Zhang</p>
            <p>The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit forming by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped from electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p>A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter that exhibits the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. \red{While theoretical studies have predicted that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can host a supersolid phase, experimental validation has remained elusive. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spins, we investigate the supersolid phase in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$.} Here, we present the magnetic phase diagram and neutron scattering results for K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, which features nearest-neighbor Ising-like interactions with $J_z = 2.96(2)$ meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$ meV. In zero field, neutron spectroscopy reveals the gradual development of a quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with Z$_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) below 15 K. \red{At temperatures below 0.3 K, the fully developed supersolid phase is evidenced by the coexistence of a gapless Goldstone mode arising from broken U$(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (superfluidity), and a gapped pseudo-Goldstone mode associated with lifted accidental XY degeneracy (solidity).} In $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields 1.1 T $<$ $B$ $<$ 21 T, a prominent 1/3 magnetization plateau phase emerges, accompanied by a \red{plausible} high-field supersolid phase (17 T $<$ $B$ $<$ 21 T). Our results establish K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$as an exceptional realization of a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice quantum Ising magnet, document its magnetic phase diagram featuring two supersolid phases, and uncover spectroscopic \red{signatures} of zero-field supersolidity in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet.</p>

            <p>This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenzhu Xie, Yong Zhang</p>
            <p>To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasufumi Nakano, Olivier Bleu, Brendan C. Mulkerin, Jesper Levinsen, Meera M. Parish</p>
            <p>We consider the scenario of excitons in a semiconductor bilayer that are strongly coupled to cavity photons, leading to the formation of dipolar exciton polaritons (dipolaritons). Using a realistic pseudopotential for the dipolar interactions, we exactly determine the scattering between dipolaritons, accounting for the hybridization between interlayer and intralayer excitons. We show that the light-matter coupling enhances the interactions between dipolaritons by forcing excitons to scatter at energies that would otherwise be forbidden in ordinary exciton-exciton collisions. Furthermore, we show that this light enhancement is sensitive to the dipole moment and is larger for long-range dipolar interactions than for short-range intralayer interactions. Our results reveal the role of dark exciton states in dipolariton interactions as well as the optimal bilayer properties for achieving strong interactions.</p>

            <h2>Sulfur in diamond and its effect on the creation of nitrogen-vacancy defect from \textit{ab initio} simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nima Ghafari Cherati, Anton Pershin, Ádám Gali</p>
            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is one of the most significant and widely studied defects in diamond that plays a prominent role in quantum technologies. The precise engineering of the location and concentration of NV centers is of great importance in quantum technology applications. To this end, irradiation techniques such as nitrogen-molecule ion implantation are applied. Recent studies have reported enhanced NV center creation and activation efficiencies introduced by nitrogen molecule ion implantation in doped diamond layers, where the maximum creation efficiency at $\sim75$\% has been achieved in sulfur-doped layers. However, the microscopic mechanisms behind these observations and the limits of the efficiencies are far from understood. In this study, we employ hybrid density functional theory calculations to compute the formation energies, charge transition levels, and the magneto-optical properties of various sulfur defects in diamond where we also consider the interaction of sulfur and hydrogen in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers. Our results imply that the competition between the donor substitutional sulfur and the hyper-deep acceptor sulfur-vacancy complex is an important limiting factor on the creation efficiency of the NV center in diamond. However, both species are able to trap interstitial hydrogen from diamond, which favorably mediates the creation of NV centers in chemical vapor-deposited diamond layers.</p>

            <p>Cavity magnomechanics is one important hybrid magnonic platform that focuses on the coherent interaction between magnons and phonons. The resulting magnon polarons inherit the intrinsic properties of both magnons and phonons, combining their individual advantages and enabling new physics and functionalities. But in previous demonstrations the magnon-phonon coupling either have limited bandwidth or cannot be efficiently accessed. In this work, we show that by utilizing the slow-wave hybrid magnonics configuration based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs), the coherent magnon-phonon interaction can be efficiently observed over a frequency range larger than 7 GHz on a YIG thin film device. In particular, the capability of the SSPPs in exciting short-wavelength magnons reveals a novel size effect when the magnons are coupled with high-over tone bulk acoustic resonances. Our work paves the way towards novel magnomechanical devices.</p>

            <h2>Photocurrent Enhancement due to Spin-Exchange Carrier Multiplication in Films of Manganese-Doped 'Inverted' CdSe/HgSe Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jungchul Noh, Clément Livache, Donghyo Hahm, Valerio Pinchetti, Ho Jin, Changjo Kim, Victor I. Klimov</p>
            <p>Incorporation of manganese impurities into II-VI semiconductors results in a dramatic change in their properties due to strong exchange interactions between the Mn ion and the semiconductor host. In colloidal quantum dots (QDs), these interactions result in a rapid bidirectional energy transfer between the magnetic impurity and the QD intrinsic states, which is characterized by an extremely high energy transfer rate of more than ~5 eV/ps. This rate is higher than the rate of energy loss due to phonon emission (typically, ~1 eV/ps or less), so Mn-QD interactions could in principle be used to capture and utilize the kinetic energy of the hot carrier before it is lost to phonons. Here, we demonstrate that by using Mn-doped CdSe/HgSe core/shell QDs, we can efficiently convert the kinetic energy of a hot exciton into an additional electron-hole pair (exciton). This carrier multiplication process occurs through rapid capture of a hot exciton by a Mn ion, which then undergoes spin flip relaxation, producing two excitons near the QD band edge. Due to the inverted geometry of the CdSe/HgSe QDs, both electrons and holes resulting from carrier multiplication occupy the QD shell, allowing them to be easily extracted from the QD for potential use in electro-optical devices or chemical reactions.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic effects on infrared vibrational and Raman spectroscopy from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang-Hao Chan, Zhenglu Li, Steven G. Louie</p>
            <p>We develop a first-principles approach to compute infrared (IR) vibrational absorption and Raman scattering spectra with excitonic effects included. Our method is based on a perturbative expansion of electron-phonon and electron-light couplings in the time-dependent adiabatic GW (TD-aGW) theory. We show that excitonic effects in the IR absorption spectrum can be included by replacing the free electron-hole propagators in the perturbative expression for independent particles with their interacting counterparts, which are readily available from standard GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations. For Raman spectrum, our derived expression agrees with the single and double resonance terms from a diagrammatic approach. We show significant excitonic enhancement in both the IR and resonance Raman scattering intensity for monolayer MoS2, WS2, and WSe2. Moreover, the exciton-phonon coupling strength and exciton energy landscape can be accessed by analyzing resonance Raman spectrum of these materials.</p>

            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect is a photocurrent generation from alternating electric field, which is a promising candidate for future efficient solar cell technology. It is the second-order optical current, which is the injection current or the shift current. We focus on the direct current generation. We show the linearly (circularly) polarized light can generate injection (shift) current in the $d$-wave altermagnet coupled with the Rashba interaction when the Néel vector points in an in-plane direction. The magnitude of the injection current does not depend\ on the frequency $% \omega $ of the applied light provided it is smaller than a certain critical frequency $\omega _{\text{c}}$ and larger than the bulk gap energy $% \varepsilon _{\text{gap}}$, $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}\leq \hbar \omega \leq \hbar \omega _{\text{c}}$. Hence, the use of the injection current is quite efficient for solar cell technology because any photon whose energy is within this range can be equally utilized.</p>

            <p>A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI nanowire based Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>The discovery of bilayer nickelate superconductors under high pressure has opened a new chapter in high-transition temperature (high-TC) superconductivity. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset above the McMillan limit (40 K) in bilayer nickelate epitaxial ultrathin films. Three-unit-cell (3UC) thick La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 single-phase-crystalline films are grown using the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy) on SrLaAlO4 substrates. Resistivity measurements and magnetic-field responses indicate onset TC = 45 K. The transition to zero resistance exhibits characteristics consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-like behavior, with TBKT = 9 K. Meissner diamagnetic effect is observed at TM = 8.5 K via a mutual inductance setup, in agreement with the BKT-like transition. In-plane and out-of-plane critical magnetic fields exhibit anisotropy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and X-ray reciprocal space mappings (RSMs) show that the films maintain a tetragonal phase with coherent epitaxial compressive strain ~2% in the NiO2 planes relative to the bulk. Our findings pave the way for comprehensive investigations of nickelate superconductors under ambient pressure conditions and for exploring superconductivity at higher transition temperature through strain engineering in heterostructures.</p>

            <p>In recent years, the interplay between non-Hermiticity and band topology is expected to uncover numerous novel physical phenomena. However, the majority of research has focused on periodic crystalline structures, with comparatively fewer studies exploring quasicrystalline systems. In this paper, we delve into the influence of asymmetric hopping on the topological insulators, specifically focusing on quantum spin Hall insulators and higher-order topological insulators in an octagonal Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. We demonstrate that asymmetric hopping can significantly alter the distribution of edge states, leading to a uniform distribution across all boundaries or localizing them at a single edge, depending on the symmetry adjustments. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of higher-order topological corner states under perturbations, showing that these states can maintain their distribution even in the presence of non-Hermiticity. Our findings not only expand the current understanding of topological states in quasicrystals under non-Hermitian conditions, but also provide valuable theoretical guidance for manipulating corner state distributions in non-Hermitian quasicrystalline higher-order topological insulators.</p>

            <p>Active systems comprising micron-sized self-propelling units, also termed microswimmers, are promising candidates for the bottom-up assembly of small structures and reconfigurable materials. Here we leverage field-driven colloidal assembly to induce structural transformations in dense layers of microswimmers driven by an alternating current (AC) electric field and confined in a microfabricated trap under the influence of gravity. By varying the electric field frequency, we realize significant structural transformations, from a gas-like state at high frequencies to dynamically rearranging dense crystalline clusters at lower frequencies, characterized by vorticity in their dynamics. We demonstrate the ability to switch between these states on-demand, showing that the clustering mechanism differs from motility-induced phase separation. Our results offer a valuable framework for designing high-density active matter systems with controllable structural properties, envisioned to advance the development of artificial materials with self-healing and reconfiguration capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irea Mosquera-Lois, Johan Klarbring, Aron Walsh</p>
            <p>Point defects dictate the properties of many functional materials. The standard approach to modelling the thermodynamics of defects relies on a static description, where the change in Gibbs free energy is approximated by the internal energy. This approach has a low computational cost, but ignores contributions from atomic vibrations and structural configurations that can be accessed at finite temperatures. We train a machine learning force field (MLFF) to explore dynamic defect behaviour using $\mathrm{Te_i^{+1}}$ and $\textit{V}{\mathrm{_{Te}^{+2}}}$ in CdTe as exemplars. We consider the different entropic contributions (e.g., electronic, spin, vibrational, orientational, and configurational) and compare methods to compute the defect free energies, ranging from a harmonic treatment to a fully anharmonic approach based on thermodynamic integration. We find that metastable configurations are populated at room temperature and thermal effects increase the predicted concentration of $\mathrm{Te_i^{+1}}$ by two orders of magnitude -- and can thus significantly affect the predicted properties. Overall, our study underscores the importance of finite-temperature effects and the potential of MLFFs to model defect dynamics at both synthesis and device operating temperatures.</p>

In the presence of an edge it is demonstrated that the quasiparticle modes can be distinguished as edge modes and bulk modes, which appear at different energies. The bulk-edge correspondence is obtained by an analytic continuation from the in-gap edge modes to the bands of bulk modes. By varying the energy we find a transition from localized edge modes to delocalized bulk modes. We calculate the quasiparticle currents, discuss briefly how these currents couple to external currents, and predict how this can be used to control the quasiparticle modes.</p>

            <p>We carry out first-principles calculations to demonstrate that the complex energy landscape and competing phases of HfO$_2$ can be understood from the four unstable flat phonon bands of an unconventional high-symmetry structure of HfO$_2$ with the space group $Cmma$. We consider structures generated from the $Cmma$ reference structure by all possible combinations of the zone center and zone boundary modes belonging to the unstable flat phonon branches. We find 12 distinct locally-stable structures, of which 5 correspond to well-known phases. We show that 6 of these 7 remaining structures can be described as period-2 superlattices of the ferroelectric $Pca2_1$ (o-FE), ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ (o-FE2), and and monoclinic $P2_1/c$ (m) structures. We demonstrate how the unstable flat phonon bands can explain the atomically thin grain boundaries in the various types of superlattices. Finally, we point out that arbitrary-period HfO$_2$ superlattices derived from the 6 different types of period-2 superlattices are expected to form based on the flatness of the unstable phonon branches. The organizing principle provided by this work deepens our understanding of the underlying physics in the phase stability of HfO$_2$ and provides guidance for functional phase stabilization.</p>

            <p>Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ronald L. Kam, Luca Binci, Aaron D. Kaplan, Kristin A. Persson, Nicola Marzari, Gerbrand Ceder</p>
            <p>The development of Mn-rich cathodes for Li-ion batteries promises to alleviate supply chain bottlenecks in battery manufacturing. Challenges in Mn-rich cathodes arise from Jahn-Teller (JT) distortions of Mn$^{3+}$, Mn migration, and phase transformations to spinel-like order, which can affect the electrochemical performance. These phenomena motivate an ab initio re-examination of the thermodynamics of the LiMnO2 polymorphs. It is found that the generalized gradient approximation (GGA - PBEsol) and meta-GGA (r2SCAN) density functionals with empirical on-site Hubbard U corrections yield spurious stable phases for LiMnO2, such as predicting a phase with gamma-LiFeO2-like order (g-LiMnO2) to be the ground state instead of the orthorhombic (Pmmn) phase, which is the experimentally known ground state. Accounting for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in each structure has a substantial effect on the total energies and resulting phase stability. By using hybrid-GGA (HSE06) and GGA with extended Hubbard parameters (on-site U and inter-site V) that are self-consistently determined, the experimentally observed LiMnO2 phase stability trends are recovered. The calculated Hubbard U in the experimentally observed orthorhombic, layered, and spinel phases (around 5.8 eV) are significantly smaller than U in g-LiMnO2 and disordered layered structures (around 6.4 eV). The smaller values of U are correlated with a collinear ordering of JT distortions, in which all $e_g$ orbitals are oriented in the same direction. This cooperative JT effect leads to increased Mn-O covalency, which contributes to the greater electronic stability compared to the phases with noncollinear JT arrangements, and also generate greater vibrational entropy, which helps stabilize these phases at high temperature. These phases are shown to be strongly insulating with large calculated band gaps > 3 eV, computed using HSE06 and $G_0W_0$.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism and Strain Induced Altermagnetic Transition in Cairo Pentagonal Monolayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuyi Li, Yu Zhang, Adrian Bahri, Xiaoliang Zhang, Chunjing Jia</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently discovered class of magnetic order characterized by vanishing net magnetization and spin-splitting band structures, has garnered significant research attention. In this work, we introduce a novel two-dimensional system that exhibits $g$-wave altermagnetism and undergoes a strain-induced transition from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism. This system can be realized in an unconventional monolayer Cairo pentagonal lattice, for which we present a realistic tight-binding model that incorporates both magnetic and non-magnetic sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-trivial band topology can emerge in this system by breaking the symmetry that protects the spin-polarized nodal points. Finally, \emph{ab initio} calculations on several candidate materials, such as FeS$_2$ and Nb$_2$FeB$_2$, which exhibit symmetry consistent with the proposed tight-binding Hamiltonian, are also presented. These findings open new avenues for exploring spintronic devices based on altermagnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic structure of polar magnet GaV$_4$Se$_8$ with N\'eel-type skyrmion lattice probed by $^{51}$V NMR</h2>

            <p>We report the magnetization and the $^{51}$V NMR measurements in the polar magnet GaV$_4$Se$_8$ in which a magnetic skyrmion lattice appears in the structural domain with the polar axis parallel to the magnetic field. Although we successfully separate the $^{51}$V NMR signals in the domain from those in the other structural domains, only the high-frequency region of NMR spectrum is observed due to a significant increase of the spin-echo decay rate in the low-frequency region. In $B_{\rm{ext}}\parallel[111]$, we find the NMR signals from the supermagnetized cycloidal state in the parallel domains as well as from the conical state in domains where the polar axis is tilted from the magnetic field. No NMR signal from the skyrmion lattice state is observed, suggesting a significant increase of the decay rate by additional low-energy excitations caused by dynamics of the skyrmions. In $B_{\rm{ext}}\parallel[001]$, where all the structural domains are magnetically equivalent, multiple NMR peaks converge into one peak at the saturation magnetic field. This field dependence is explained by the closing of magnetic cones as approaching the forced-ferromagnetic state.</p>

Here, we report an optical spectroscopy study of a topological hourglass semimetal Nb3SiTe6 with the electric field of the incident light parallel to its crystalline ab-plane. The ab-plane optical conductivity spectra of Nb3SiTe6 single crystals exhibit a remarkable peak-like feature around 1.20 eV, which is mainly contributed by the direct optical transitions between the two ab-initio-calculation-derived flat bands along the momentum direction Z-U. Our results pave the way for investigating exotic quantum phenomena based on the flat bands in topological hourglass semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingyu Yao, Ruihan Zhang, Sheng Zhang, Haohao Sheng, Youguo Shi, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Zhijun Wang</p>
            <p>The magnetic topological phases attract much interest, such as the axion insulator, higher-order topology, Weyl semimetals, and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Here, we predict that the axion insulator phase, magnetic Weyl points, and QAHE can be achieved in Eu3In2As4. Recently, the single-crystal Eu3In2As4 has been successfully synthesized, which exhibits an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state. Our first-principles calculations show that it lies on the phase boundary between multiple magnetic topological phases, and the magnetic anisotropy is weak, with an energy difference less than 1 meV. In the AFM state, it can be tuned to an axion insulator by tensile strain. The quantized axion angle $\theta = \pi$ and the magnetic higher-order topology are characterized by the parity index $Z_4 = 2$. By applying an external magnetic field, the induced ferromagnetic (FM) state becomes an ideal magnetic topological semimetal with a single pair of Weyl points or a nodal ring. The QAHE can be achieved in FM multilayer films of Eu3In2As4 on a magnetic insulating substrate.</p>

            <h2>Capturing thin-film microstructure contributions during ultrafast laser-metal interactions using atomistic simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hariprasath Ganesan, Stefan Sandfeld</p>
            <p>Progress in the emerging fields of atomic and close-to-atomic scale manufacturing is underpinned by enhanced precision and optimization of laser-controlled nanostructuring. Understanding thin films' crystallographic orientations and microstructure effects becomes crucial for optimizing the laser-metallic thin film interactions; however, these effects remain largely unexplored at the atomic scale. Using a hybrid two-temperature model and molecular dynamics, we simulated ultrafast laser-metal interactions for gold thin films with varying crystallographic orientations and microstructure configurations. Microstructure features, namely grain size, grain topology, and local crystallographic orientation, controlled the rate and extent of lattice disorder evolution and phase transformation, particularly at lower applied fluences. Our simulations provided comprehensive insights encompassing both the nanomechanical and thermodynamic aspects of ultrafast laser-metal interactions at atomic resolution. Microstructure-aware/informed thin film fabrication and targeted defect engineering could improve the precision of nanoscale laser processing and potentially emerge as an energy-efficient optimization strategy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yichi Zhang, Hua Bai, Lei Han, Jiankun Dai, Chong Chen, Shixuan Liang, Yanzhang Cao, Yingying Zhang, Qian Wang, Wenxuan Zhu, Feng Pan, Cheng Song</p>
            <p>Due to nonrelativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE), altermagnets can generate time-reversal-odd spin current and spin splitting torque (SST) with spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector. Hence the effective manipulation of SST would provide plenty of opportunities for designable spintronic devices, which remains elusive. Here, the electrical control of SST is achieved in altermagnetic RuO2, based on controllable Néel vector of RuO2 and Néel vector-dependent generation of SST. We demonstrate the current-induced switching of Néel vector via spin-orbit torque in RuO2 films, according to the reversible polarity of electrical transport measurements and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD). The XMLD also unprecedentedly demonstrates that Néel vector really exists in altermagnets. The switching of Néel vector to the current direction and resultantly enhanced spin polarization parallel to the Néel vector brings about stronger ASSE-induced spin current. Our findings not only enrich the properties of altermagnets but also pave the way for high speed memories and nano-oscillators with excellent controllability and efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Electron-Magnon Interaction-Induced Topological Phase Transition in Magnetic Weyl Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konstantinos Sourounis, Aurélien Manchon</p>
            <p>Despite the tremendous interest raised by the recent realization of magnetic Weyl semimetals and the observation of giant anomalous Hall signals, most of the theories used to interpret experimental data overlook the magnetic fluctuations, which are ubiquitous in such materials and can massively impact topological and transport properties. In this work, we predict that in such magnetic topological systems, the interaction between electrons and magnons substantially destabilizes the Weyl nodes, leading to a topological phase transition below the Curie temperature. Remarkably, the sensitivity of the Weyl nodes to electron-magnon interaction depends on their spin chirality. We find that Weyl nodes with a trivial chirality are more sensitive to electron-magnon interactions than Weyl nodes presenting an inverted chirality, demonstrating the resilience of the latter compared to the former. Our results open perspectives for the interpretation of the transport signatures of Weyl semimetals, especially close to the Curie temperature.</p>

            <p>Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a procedure for constructing a maximally localized Wannier basis for a subspace of bands with a non-zero Chern number. Bands with non-trivial topological indices have a topological obstruction preventing them from being represented by exponentially localized Wannier states. Here, we analyze the limits of using the projection procedure to obtain a Wannierizable subspace from a set of topologically obstructed bands. The Wannier functions from this subspace form what we refer to as a "reduced Wannier representation," indicating that the Wannier functions necessarily do not span the full topological manifold. We consider the Haldane tight-binding model in the Chern phase as the platform for our investigation.</p>

            <p>We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</p>

            <h2>Supercell Wannier Functions and Emergent Kondo Lattices in Topological Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brandon Monsen, Martin Claassen</p>
            <p>Conventional theories for Mott insulators involve well-localized electronic orbitals. This picture fails in the presence of topological obstructions in Chern bands which prevent the formation of exponentially localized orbitals and are instead often viewed by analogy to Landau levels. Here, we show that strong interactions in fractionally-filled topological bands realize a class of Mott insulating states on emergent topological Kondo lattices. These can be naturally described by a partial Wannier basis of N-1 exponentially-localized orbitals for an N-band manifold with net non-zero Chern number. Choosing a gauge which breaks translation symmetry, we construct a supercell basis which segregates an isolated topological band into well-localized supercell Wannier orbitals that can host the local moments of a Mott insulating state, as well as an itinerant power-law-localized orbital that retains the topological obstruction. Together, they constitute a spontaneous Kondo lattice. We study fractionally-filled interacting quantum spin Hall bands in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model as well as twisted bilayers of MoTe2 at -1/3 filling. We demonstrate that strong short-ranged Coulomb interactions can stabilize a new class of topological Mott insulating states with broken translation symmetry and antiferromagnetic order, which compete with fractional Chern insulating states. Our results predict a new scenario for time-reversal-symmetric interacting topological bands in solids, beyond conventional Landau level paradigms for the fractional quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We investigate the ultrafast structural dynamics of LaAlO3 thin films driven by short mid-infrared laser pulses at 20 THz. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction reveals an immediate lattice expansion and an acoustic breathing mode of the film. First-principles theory and a spring-mass model identify the direct coupling between coherently driven infrared-active phonons and strain as the underlying mechanism. Time-resolved optical birefringence measurements confirm that the amplitude of this acoustic mode scales linearly with the pump fluence, which agrees with the theory. Furthermore, time-resolved X-ray diffuse scattering indicates that THz excitation enhances crystallinity by inducing a non-thermal increase in structural symmetry originating from preexisting defects. These findings highlight the potential of a multimodal approach-combining time-resolved X-ray and optical measurements and first-principles theory-to elucidate and control structural dynamics in nanoscale materials.</p>

            <p>Compounds with the anti-PbFCl structure exhibit a variety of electronic instabilities and intriguing physical properties. NaAlSi and NaAlGe are similar topological nodal-line semimetals, but they have distinct properties. NaAlSi is a superconductor at 6.8 K, whereas NaAlGe is an insulator with a pseudogap of approximately 100 K. Using the potassium-indium flux method, we succeeded in synthesizing a single crystal of KAlGe, a new anti-PbFCl compound. First principles electronic structure calculations reveal that KAlGe is isoelectronic with NaAlSi and NaAlGe. KAlGe undergoes a metal-to-metal transition at 89 K and exhibits no superconductivity above 1.8 K. The low temperature phase has significantly lower carrier density and extremely high mobility, similar to Dirac electron systems. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction experiments show a structural change that breaks the fourfold symmetry during the phase transition. Electron-phonon interactions may be responsible for superconductivity in NaAlSi, whereas excitonic electron-hole interactions are thought to play an important role in KAlGe and possibly NaAlGe. Our findings demonstrate that fascinating physics lies within the compound family.</p>

            <p>Large, high-purity single-crystals of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are essential for exploiting its many desirable and interesting properties. Here, we demonstrate via X-ray tomography, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy that h-BN crystals can be grown by traveling-solvent floating-zone (TSFZ). The diameters of grown boules range from 3 -- 5 mm with lengths from 2 -- 7 mm. Tomography indicates variable grain sizes within the boules, with the largest having areas of $\approx$ 1 mm $\times$ 2 mm and thickness $\approx$ 0.5 mm. Although the boules contain macroscale flux inclusions, the h-BN lattice itself is of high quality for samples grown under optimized conditions. The currently optimized growth procedure employs an Fe flux, moderate N$_2$ pressure ($P_{N2} \approx$ 6 bar), and a growth rate of 0.1 mm/h.Raman spectroscopy for an optimized sample gives an average linewidth of 7.7(2) cm$^{-1}$ for the $E_{2g}$ intralayer mode at 1365.46(4) cm$^{-1}$ and 1.0(1) cm$^{-1}$ for the $E_{2g}$ interlayer shear mode at 51.78(9) cm$^{-1}$. The corresponding photoluminescence spectrum shows sharp phonon-assisted free exciton peaks and minimal signal in the energy range corresponding to carbon-related defects ($E$ = 3.9 -- 4.1 eV). Our work demonstrates the viability of growing h-BN by the TSFZ technique, thereby opening a new route towards larger, high-quality crystals and advancing the state of h-BN related research.</p>

            <p>A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</p>

Exact diagonalization shows the degeneracy of zero-energy states scales exponentially with size of the system, with a recurrence relation between different system sizes. We solve the degeneracy problem by showing the ground states can be systematically constructed by inserting immobile walls of fermions into the chain. Mapping the counting problem to a combinatorial one and obtaining the exact generating function, we prove the recurrence relation on both open and periodic chains. We also provide an explicit mapping between ground states, giving a combinatorial explanation of the recurrence relation.</p>

            <p>We consider a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in the assisted hopping limit, where direct electron hopping is subdominant. At fixed electron-phonon coupling and in the absence of Coulomb interactions, the model shows a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a $(\pi,0)$ valence bond solid in the adiabatic limit and a quantum antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase at high phonon frequencies. Here, we show that by adding terms to the model that reinforce the AFM phase, thereby lowering the critical phonon frequency, the quantum phase transition becomes strongly first order. Our results do not depend on the symmetry of the model. In fact, adding a Hubbard-$U$ term to the model lowers the O(4) symmetry of the model to SU(2) such that the DQCP we observe has the same symmetries as other models that account for similar quantum phase transitions.</p>

The new release improves upon version 2.0 through the introduction of several emerging real-time path integral (PI) methods, including fast centroid molecular dynamics (f-CMD) and fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) methods, as well as our recently introduced hybrid CMD (h-CMD) method for the accurate and efficient simulation of vibrational infrared spectra. Several test cases, including liquid bulk water at 300 K and ice Ih at 150 K, are used to showcase the performance of different implemented PI methods in simulating the infrared spectra at both ambient conditions and low temperatures where NQEs become more apparent. Additionally, using different salt-in-water (i.e., dilute) and water-in-salt (i.e., concentrated) lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) aqueous electrolyte solutions, we demonstrate the applicability of our recently introduced h-CMD method implemented in DL_POLY Quantum 2.1 for the large scale simulation of IR spectra of complex heterogeneous systems. We show that h-CMD can overcome the curvature problem of CMD and the artificial broadening of T-RPMD for the accurate simulation of the vibrational spectra of complex, heterogeneous systems with NQEs included.</p>

            <p>Recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the explorations of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic materials and suitable substrates. Using MnPX3 (X = S, Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting arises in the AA-stacking MnPX3/MPX3 (M = Cd, Mg, Zn) heterostructures, while compensated ferrimagnetic splitting emerges in the AB-stacking configurations. Combining MnPX3 and ferroelectric substrates like CuInP2S6 results in switchable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on band structures, which can be tuned by applying out-of-plane electric fields to non-volatilely reversing the ferroelectric polarization. In summary, our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing light-matter interactions by strongly confining light fields. Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular polarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a chiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised photons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing monolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of intrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by circularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The PL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of uncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic model shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone creating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside the light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy relaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of the upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton behaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the BIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons ($\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow \uparrow$) can be controlled by $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively. Our work introduces a new type of chiral light-matter quasi-particles in atomically-thin semiconductors and provides an insight into their energy relaxation dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Emerging Microelectronic Materials by Design: Navigating Combinatorial Design Space with Scarce and Dispersed Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hengrui Zhang, Alexandru B. Georgescu, Suraj Yerramilli, Christopher Karpovich, Daniel W. Apley, Elsa A. Olivetti, James M. Rondinelli, Wei Chen</p>
            <p>The increasing demands of sustainable energy, electronics, and biomedical applications call for next-generation functional materials with unprecedented properties. Of particular interest are emerging materials that display exceptional physical properties, making them promising candidates in energy-efficient microelectronic devices. As the conventional Edisonian approach becomes significantly outpaced by growing societal needs, emerging computational modeling and machine learning (ML) methods are employed for the rational design of materials. However, the complex physical mechanisms, cost of first-principles calculations, and the dispersity and scarcity of data pose challenges to both physics-based and data-driven materials modeling. Moreover, the combinatorial composition-structure design space is high-dimensional and often disjoint, making design optimization nontrivial. In this Account, we review a team effort toward establishing a framework that integrates data-driven and physics-based methods to address these challenges and accelerate materials design. We begin by presenting our integrated materials design framework and its three components in a general context. We then provide an example of applying this materials design framework to metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials, a specific type of emerging materials with practical importance in next-generation memory technologies. We identify multiple new materials which may display this property and propose pathways for their synthesis. Finally, we identify some outstanding challenges in data-driven materials design, such as materials data quality issues and property-performance mismatch. We seek to raise awareness of these overlooked issues hindering materials design, thus stimulating efforts toward developing methods to mitigate the gaps.</p>

            <h2>Spin current generation by acousto-electric evanescent wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuya Kawada, Masashi Kawaguchi, Kei Yamamoto, Hiroki Matsumoto, Ryusuke Hisatomi, Hiroshi Kohno, Sadamichi Maekawa, Masamitsu Hayashi</p>
            <p>We experimentally demonstrate that a spin current can be induced by the acousto-electric evanescent wave, an electric field associated with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) that decay along the surface normal. A previous study showed that a magnetic-field-dependent dc voltage (acoustic voltage) emerges in heavy metal (HM)/ferromagnet (FM) bilayers under excitation of SAWs. The effect, referred to as the acoustic spin Hall effect, was understood by assuming a SAW-induced ac spin current rectified by the oscillation of the FM layer magnetization and the inverse spin Hall effect. However, the mechanism of the spin current generation remained unidentified. Here we measure the acoustic voltage as a function of the SAW propagation direction relative to the crystalline orientation of a LiNbO$_3$ substrate. We find that the magnetic field angle dependence of the acoustic voltage exhibits a phase shift depending on the SAW propagation direction. The result is consistently explained in terms of the acousto-electric evanescent wave generating the spin current in HM layer via the spin Hall effect, thus clarifies the origin of the acoustic spin Hall effect.</p>

            <p>We investigate the scattering halos resulting from collisions between discrete momentum components in the time-of-flight expansion of interaction-tunable $^6\rm Li_2$ molecular Bose-Einstein condensates. A key highlight of this study is the observation of the influence of interactions on the collisional scattering process. We measure the production of scattering halos at different interaction levels by varying the number of particles and the scattering length, and quantitatively assess the applicability of perturbation theory. To delve into a general theory of scattering halos, we introduce a scattering factor and obtain a universal relation between it and the halo ratio. Furthermore, we simulate the formation of scattering halos under non-perturbative conditions and analyze the discrepancies between simulation results and experiments through a return pulse experiment. This study enhances our understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying scattering processes in many-body systems and provides new perspectives for further theoretical research.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepak K. Roy, Mukul Kabir</p>
            <p>The quest for room-temperature nanoscale magnets remains a central challenge, driven by their promising applications in quantum technologies. Layered $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with high magnetic ordering temperatures offer significant potential in this context. We explore ultrathin \ce{SrRu2O6} nanosheets using first-principles calculations, complemented by the classical Heisenberg Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, these nanosheets exhibit robust antiferromagnetic ordering with Néel temperatures exceeding 430 K, despite the enhanced spin fluctuations characteristic of two-dimensional systems. Surface-termination-induced intrinsic charge doping introduces complexity to the magnetism, resulting in an insulator-to-metal transition and renormalized Néel temperatures in doped systems. A detailed microscopic analysis reveals distinct mechanisms underlying the magnetic behavior in electron- and hole-doped nanosheets. These findings provide a foundation for advancing theoretical and experimental studies in the largely unexplored realm of correlated oxides at the two-dimensional limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernd Aichner, Sandra Keppert, Johannes D. Pedarnig, Wolfgang Lang</p>
            <p>Few-unit cell thick Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) layers have recently attracted much interest due to their extreme anisotropy and two-dimensional superconductivity, although they are typically susceptible to ambient conditions. In this study, we report on thin films approximately 13 unit cells thick that are stable in air, exhibit high anisotropy, and demonstrate extraordinarily high critical currents. By examining the superconducting transition under magnetic fields applied in both out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, we estimate key parameters such as pinning potentials, coherence lengths, London penetration depth, anisotropy factor, and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. The volume pinning force is better described by a model incorporating an exponential decay term attributed to pronounced thermally-assisted flux flow. The Hall effect in the Bi-2212 films exhibits an extensive anomaly with a double sign change that may challenge existing theoretical explanations for this poorly understood phenomenon in copper-oxide superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Influence of Magnetic Field and Temperature on Half Width at Half Maximum of Multi-photon Absorption Spectrum in Two-dimensional Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cao Thi Vi Ba, Nguyen Quang Bau, Nguyen Dinh Nam, Anh-Tuan Tran, Nguyen Thu Huong</p>
            <p>We use the Profile numerical method to calculate the spectral line width, or half width at half maximum (HWHM) of the absorption peaks of multi-photon absorption processes in a two-dimensional graphene system (2DGS) according to important external parameters such as magnetic field and temperature in the presence of strong electromagnetic waves (SEMW). The appearance of these absorption peaks is theoretically obtained from magneto-phonon resonance conditions within the framework of the quantum kinetic equation. The results take into account both scattering mechanisms: electron-optical phonon and electron-acoustic phonon. Under the influence of the magnetic field, according to the increasing photon energy of the SEMW, the graph showing the dependence of the multi-photon nonlinear absorption coefficient on photon energy has the form of absorption spectrum lines following magneto-phonon resonance conditions. When increasing the value of the external magnetic field and the intensity of the SEMW, the intensity of the resonance peaks increases. In addition, the HWHM W of the resonance peaks of multi-photon absorption processes increases with increasing magnetic field $\mathrm{B}$ according to the square root law $\mathrm{W} = \kappa\sqrt{\mathrm{B}}$ but is independent of temperature. The value of the HWHM of the one-photon absorption process is larger than the value of the HWHM of the multi-photon absorption processes. The calculations of the HWHM of the one-photon absorption process in this paper are consistent with previous experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Thus, our calculations of the HWHM of multi-photon absorption processes can serve as reliable predictions for future experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riku Adachi, Hiroki Kojima, Takashi Ikegami</p>
            <p>To further understand the complex behavior of swimming microorganisms, the spontaneous motion of nonliving matter provides essential insights. While substantial research has focused on quantitatively analyzing complex behavioral patterns, characterizing these dynamics aiming for inclusive comparison to the behavior of living systems remains challenging. In this study, we experimentally and numerically investigated the 'life-like' behavior of an oil droplet in an aqueous surfactant solution by identifying behavioral modes of spontaneous motion patterns in response to varying physical parameters, such as volume and oil concentration. Leveraging data-driven nonparametric dynamical systems analysis, we discovered the low dimensionality and nonlinearity of the underlying dynamical system governing oil droplet motion. Notably, our simulations demonstrate that the two-dimensional Langevin equations effectively reproduce the overall behavior experimentally observed while retaining the rational correspondence with physical parameter interpretations. These findings not only elucidate the fundamental dynamics governing the spontaneous motion of oil droplet systems but also suggest potential pathways for developing more descriptive models that bridge the gap between nonliving and living behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Quantum theory of the effect of increasing weak electromagnetic wave by a strong laser radiation in 2D Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anh-Tuan Tran, Nguyen Dinh Nama, Nguyen Thi Thanh Nhan, Nguyen Quang Bau</p>
            <p>Analytic expressions for the absorption coefficient (AC) of a weak electromagnetic wave (EMW) in 2D Graphene under influence of strong laser radiation are calculated using the quantum kinetic equation (QKE) in the case of electron-optical phonon scattering in both the absence and presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the graphene sheet. The dependence of the AC on the intensity $E_{02}$ and the frequency $\Omega_2$ of a weak EMW, on the intensity $E_{01}$ and the frequency $\Omega_1$ of a strong laser radiation, on the temperature T of the system is obtained. These results are investigated from low temperature to high temperature. These results are obtained from the QKE method, which broke the limit of the Boltzmann kinetic equations (only investigated in the high-temperature domain). Besides, the numerical results show that the AC of a weak EMW in 2D Graphene can have negative values. This demonstrates the possibility of increasing weak EMW by strong laser radiation in 2D Graphene. This is different from a similar problem in bulk semiconductors and the case without strong laser radiation. In the case of the presence of an external magnetic field, the numerical calculation results also show the appearance of the peak spectral lines that obey the magneto-phonon resonance conditions. The appearance of these resonance peaks provides a model illustrating the dependence of the Half-Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) on the external magnetic field. This is an important criterion for the fabrication of graphene-related electronic components and orientation for future experiments.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical quantum typicality: A simple method for investigating transport properties applied to the Holstein model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Petar Mitrić</p>
            <p>We examine the practical applicability of the so-called dynamical quantum typicality (QT) for the calculation of the frequency dependent mobility in electron-phonon systems. The QT approach relies on the insight that even a single, randomly chosen pure state within a high-dimensional Hilbert space can effectively represent the entire statistical ensemble. This significantly simplifies the calculation of the current-current correlation function, which in turn, within the linear response theory, is directly related to the frequency dependent mobility. The time evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$ and the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\beta H}$ are handled using the Runge-Kutta scheme. As a result, we achieve a simple, transparent method that is easy to implement, with computer memory requirements and computational effort scaling linearly with the Hilbert space dimension and the time grid length. Although this approach is quite general, we restrict our numerical results to the Holstein model for which several reliable benchmarks are available. We demonstrate that the QT effectively complements other currently employed methods by overcoming some of their inherent limitations.</p>

            <h2>Shape of Polystyrene Droplets on Soft PDMS: Exploring the Gap Between Theory and Experiment at the Three-Phase Contact Line</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khalil Remini, Leonie Schmeller, Dirk Peschka, Barbara Wagner, Ralf Seemann</p>
            <p>The shapes of liquid polystyrene (PS) droplets on viscoelastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates are investigated experimentally using atomic force microscopy for a range of droplet sizes and substrate elasticities. These shapes, which comprise the PS-air, PS-PDMS, and PDMS-air interfaces as well as the three-phase contact line, are compared to theoretical predictions using axisymmetric sharp-interface models derived through energy minimization. We find that the polystyrene droplets are cloaked by a thin layer of uncrosslinked molecules migrating from the PDMS substrate. By incorporating the effects of cloaking into the surface energies in our theoretical model, we show that the global features of the experimental droplet shapes are in excellent quantitative agreement for all droplet sizes and substrate elasticities. However, our comparisons also reveal systematic discrepancies between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions in the vicinity of the three-phase contact line. Moreover, the relative importance of these discrepancies systematically increases for softer substrates and smaller droplets. We demonstrate that global variations in system parameters, such as surface tension and elastic shear moduli, cannot explain these differences but instead point to a locally larger elastocapillary length, whose possible origin is discussed thoroughly.</p>

            <h2>A crack-length control technique for phase field fracture in FFT homogenization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro Aranda, Javier Segurado</p>
            <p>Modeling the propagation of cracks at the microscopic level is fundamental to understand the effect of the microstructure on the fracture process. Nevertheless, microscopic propagation is often unstable and when using phase field fracture poor convergence is found or, in the case of using staggered algorithms, leads to the presence of jumps in the evolution of the cracks. In this work, a novel method is proposed to perform micromechanical simulations with phase field fracture imposing monotonic increases of crack length and allowing the use of monolithic implementations, being able to resolve all the snap-backs during the unstable propagation phases. The method is derived for FFT based solvers in order to exploit its very high numerical performance n micromechanical problems, but an equivalent method is also developed for Finite Elements (FE) showing the equivalence of both implementations. It is shown that the stress-strain curves and the crack paths obtained using the crack control method are superposed in stable propagation regimes to those obtained using strain control with a staggered scheme. J-integral calculations confirm that during the propagation process in the crack control method, the energy release rate remains constant and equal to an effective fracture energy that has been determined as function of the discretization for FFT simulations. Finally, to show the potential of the method, the technique is applied to simulate crack propagation through the microstructure of composites and porous materials providing an estimation of the effective fracture toughness.</p>

            <p>Motivated by the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor, the pressurized $\rm{La}_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7}$, we present a renormalized mean-field theory of a bilayer single-band $t$-$J$ model, highlighting the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. We analyze the pairing symmetry and magnetic properties of the system, predicting two distinct states in which magnetism and superconductivity coexist. As hole doping increases, the magnetic order is rapidly suppressed. The inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}$ and coupling $J_{\perp}$ promote a transition from intra-layer $d$-wave pairing to $s$-wave pairing, which is accompanied by a shift from antiferromagnetic (AFM) order to a double spin stripe configuration. The latter has been extensively observed in ambient and high-pressure experiments. Our study offers theoretical insights into the coexistence of spin density waves and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have garnered significant interest as single photon emitters (SPEs) due to their remarkable optical and quantum properties. An intriguing property of these defects is that they can be spin-active ($S\geq 1$), even if weakly interacting. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that two monomers of C-based defects of the same species can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature, even when they are separated $\lesssim 1$ nm, if they reside in different layers. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of C defects in different layers lies within $1.6-2.2$ eV range. Also, we found defects that deviate from the typical phonon replica patterns, potentially explaining the observed phonon replicas in yellow emitters in hBN.</p>

            <p>Extensive studies on the impact of bismuth incorporation into the (Ga,Mn)As prototype dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (DFS) on its structural, magnetic and magnetotransport properties are summarized in this review. Thin epitaxial layers of the quaternary (Ga,Mn)(Bi,As) compound, containing up to 1% Bi and 6% Mn atoms, and the reference ternary (Ga,Mn)As compound, have been grown under either a compressive or tensile biaxial misfit strain by the low-temperature molecular-beam epitaxy technique with precisely optimized growth conditions. The high-resolution X-ray diffractometry measurements and transmission electron microscopy imaging of cross-sections across the sample interfaces have evidenced for high structural perfection of the DFS layers and sharp interfaces with the substrate. An addition of bismuth into the layers causes a small decrease in their ferromagnetic Curie temperature and a distinct increase in the coercive fields, as revealed by the superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry investigations. Most of all, the incorporation of a small atomic fraction of heavy Bi atoms, substituting As atoms in the layer, predominantly enhances the spin-orbit coupling strength in its valence band, considerably affecting electromagnetic properties of the layers. Investigations of magnetotransport properties of the DFS layers, performed on micro-Hall-bars prepared from the layers using electron-beam lithography patterning, reveal, as a result of Bi addition to the layers, significantly enhanced magnitudes of magnetoresistance, anomalous and planar Hall effects as well as the spin-orbit torque effect. The latter effect is of special interest for applications to the next generation non-volatile data storage and logic spintronic devices, utilizing electrically controlled magnetization reversal.</p>

            <p>Aligning with the everlasting search for quantum spin liquids (QSLs), identifying the QSL in Kitaev magnets has garnered great research interest during the past decade and remains nevertheless an enormous challenge. One of the major difficulties lies in that Kitaev QSL is typically fragile against competing interactions like off-diagonal exchanges, which are ubiquitous in real materials due to spin-orbit coupling and crystal-field effect. This, in turn, gives rise to many intriguing field-induced novel phases and thermal Hall effect. In this review, we will focus on the interplay of Kitaev interaction and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ exchanges from a numerical perspective. This review discusses some representative exotic phases such as $\Gamma$ spin liquid, nematic ferromagnet, spin-flop phase, and distinct chiral-spin states with spontaneously time-reversal symmetry breaking. It also presents quantum phase diagrams of anisotropic Kitaev-$\Gamma$ chains that exhibit kaleidoscopes of both ordered and disordered phases.</p>

            <p>Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</p>

            <p>A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N >2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present an empirical force field for hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayers, derived via a bottom-up strategy from first principles calculations. We aim to deliver a simple analytical force field for boron nitride which is efficient and applicable to large-scale simulations, without compromising its accuracy. The force field is developed with the goal to analytically reproducing the potential energy contributions arising from planar bond-stretching and bond-angle-bending deformations, as well as from out-of-plane torsional deformations, as obtained from periodic density functional theory calculations. Analytical anharmonic potential energy functions were employed to describe and parameterize the force field through a fitting process. The potential is applied for estimating in-plane (stiffness matrix and elastic constants) and out-of-plane (bending and Gaussian rigidity) mechanical properties of monolayer hBNs using both molecular mechanics calculations and analytical formulas. Additionally, we determined the elastic properties of more complex nanostructures, including hBN nanotubes and nanotori. An analytical expression has been provided for the dependence of the bending rigidity of relatively large diameter hBN nanotubes on their radius.</p>

            <h2>AFM Cantilever Magnetometry for Measuring Femto-Nm Torques Generated by Single Magnetic Particles for Cell Actuation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria V. Efremova, Lotte Boer, Laurenz Edelmann, Lieke Ruijs, Jianing Li, Marc A. Verschuuren, Reinoud Lavrijsen</p>
            <p>Particles with high anisotropy in their magnetic properties and shape are of increasing interest for mechanobiology, where transducing a remotely applied magnetic field vector to a local mechanical response is crucial. An outstanding challenge is quantifying the mechanical torque of a single nanoparticle, typically in the range of atto- to femto-Newton-meters (Nm). The magneto-mechanical torque manifests due to a misalignment of the external magnetic field vector with the built-in magnetic anisotropy axis, as opposed to a magnetic force, and complicates the measurement scheme. In this work, we developed a method using a commercially available Atomic Force Microscopy setup and cantilevers to quantify the torque generated by a single synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) nanoplatelet with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Specifically, we measured 1.6$\pm$0.6$\cdot$10$^{-15}$ Nm torque while applying 373$\pm$5 mT field at 12$\pm$2 degrees to the built-in anisotropy axis exerted by a single circular SAF nanoplatelet with 1.88 $\mu$m diameter and 72 nm thickness, naively translating to a $\approx$ 1.7 nN maximum force at the nanoplatelet apex. This measured torque and derived force of the SAF nanoplatelets is strong enough for most applications in mechanobiology; for example, it can be used to rupture (cancer) cell membranes. Moreover, SAF nanoplatelets open a route for easy tuning of the built-in magnetic anisotropy and size, reducing the torque and allowing for small mechanical stimuli for ion channel activation. This work presents a straightforward and widely applicable method for characterizing magnetic particles' mechanical transduction, which is applied to SAF nanoplatelets with a high PMA.</p>

            <h2>Phase-dependent supercurrent and microwave dissipation of HgTe quantum well Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Liu, Stanislau U. Piatrusha, Lena Fürst, Lukas Lunczer, Tatiana Borzenko, Martin P. Stehno, Laurens W. Molenkamp</p>
            <p>We measured the microwave response of a HgTe quantum well Josephson junction embedded into an RF SQUID loop which is inductively coupled to a superconducting resonator. The side-contacted devices studied here operate in bulk transport mode, with a separation between the superconducting contacts smaller than both the estimated carrier mean free path and superconducting coherence length. We extract the current-phase relation and the phase-dependent microwave dissipation, that, at low temperature, primarily is related to photon-induced transitions between the Andreev bound states. We study the effects of gate voltage and temperature on our devices and compare the measurements with a tight-binding model based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. A combined analysis of both microwave admittance components allows us to confirm the presence of a small gap in the Andreev bound state spectrum at phase $\pi$, indicating high interface transparency, matching our observations in DC measurements of a similar device. Our work demonstrates the versatility of microwave measurements as a tool for Josephson junction characterization and highlights the importance of the interface properties for side-contacted Josephson devices.</p>

            <h2>Buried Interfaces and Spin Orientation in [Co/Pt]10 /Fe multilayer with Orthogonal Magnetic Anisotropy: Effect of Fe Thickness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sadhana Singh, Manisha Priyadarsini, Sharanjeet Singh, Ilya Sergeev, Marcus Herlitschke, H. C. Wille, Dileep Kumar</p>
            <p>In the present work, spin orientation and variation of the strength of coupling in [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer have been investigated as a function of the thickness of the Fe layer. [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer has orthogonal anisotropy with the Fe layer, and [Co/Pt]ML has in-plane magnetic anisotropy and perpendicular anisotropy, respectively. Measurements are performed using in-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and isotope-sensitive depth-resolved nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) technique. Real-time in-situ MOKE measurement during Fe growth reveals that with an increase in thickness of the Fe layer, moments of Fe layer reorientation from out of the plane to in-plane direction. This is attributed to the decrease in the coupling between the [Co/Pt]ML and Fe layer. For the depth-dependent study, two [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayers having the same thickness but different positions of the Fe57 marker layer ([Co/Pt]MLFe/Fe57) and [Co/Pt]MLFe57/Fe ) were studied using the NRS technique. Films with varying external magnetic fields were also studied to investigate coupling strength. Measurements were performed under the x-ray standing wave conditions to enhance resonance yield. It is observed that for the 75 Å Fe in [Co/Pt]ML/Fe multilayer, the coupling varies along the depth of the Fe layer. The coupling is strong at [Co/Pt]ML and Fe interface with spins of the Fe layer aligned in the out-of-plane direction, whereas moments away from the interface are weakly coupled and aligned in-plane along the magnetic easy axis. Due to this gradient in strength of coupling along the depth, a large magnetic field is required to reorient spins at the interface along the magnetic hard axis of the Fe layer; however, spins away from the interface can rotate freely even in the low magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Pressure Evolution of Magnetic Structure and Quasiparticle Excitations in Anisotropic Frustrated Zigzag Chains</h2>

            <p>Frustrated magnetic systems with anisotropic exchange interactions have been recognized as key platforms for discovering exotic quantum states and quasiparticles. In this study, we report the pressure evolution of magnetic structures and quasiparticle excitations in the frustrated semiconductor YbCuS2, characterized by Yb3+ zigzag chains with competing exchange interactions. At ambient pressure, YbCuS2 exhibits a magnetic transition at TN ~ 0.95 K, forming an incommensurate helical magnetic order. Under hydrostatic pressure of 1.6 GPa, TN increases to 1.17 K, and the magnetic structure changes to a commensurate one, which can be regarded as an odd-parity magnetic multipole order. Remarkably, pressure suppresses the gapless quasiparticle excitations. These findings suggest that pressure alters the exchange interactions between the Yb ions, affecting both the magnetic ground state and the quasiparticle excitations. Our results highlight the pivotal role of anisotropic interactions in one-dimensionality to stabilize the complex quantum phases, offering insights into the interplay among frustration, dimensionality, multipoles and emergent quasiparticles.</p>

            <p>Providing radio frequency (RF) signals to circuits working in cryogenic conditions requires bulky and expensive transmission cabling interfacing specialized RF electronics anchored at room temperature. Superconducting Josephson junction arrays (JJAs) can change this paradigm by placing the RF source and detector inside the chip. In this work, we demonstrate that DC-biased JJAs can emit signals in the C-band frequency spectrum and beyond. We fabricate reproducible JJAs comprised of amorphous MoGe or NbTiN superconducting islands and metallic Au weak links. Temperature, magnetic fields, applied currents, and device design are explored to control the operation of the RF sources, while we also identify important features that affect the ideal source behavior. Combined with the proven ability of these JJAs to detect microwave radiation, these sources allow us to propose a fully DC-operated cryogenic on-chip measurement platform that is a viable alternative to the high-frequency circuitry currently required for several quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Magnetoresistance effect lays the foundation for spintronics, magnetic sensors and hard drives. The pursuit of magnetic materials with colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and/or angular magnetoresistance (AMR) has attracted enduring research interest and extensive investigations over past decades. Here we report on the discovery of field-induced record-breaking CMR of ~ -10^14 % and AMR ~ 10^14% achieved simultaneously in an antiferromagnetic rare-earth dichalcogenide EuSe2. Such intriguing observations are attributed to strong magnetic anisotropy and magnetic-field induced antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic transition of the localized Eu2+ spins, which in turn closes the bandgap by lifting the degeneracy of Se-5p bands near Fermi level. Our DFT calculations perfectly replicate the experimental findings based on the Brillouin function and carries transport model. The present work provides a potential simple antiferromagnetic material for achieving angle-sensitive spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vincent Lahoche, Dine Ousmane Samary, Parham Radpay</p>
            <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the glassy phase in $p$-spin quantum models, this paper examines the dynamics of the $N$-vector $\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the framework of renormalization group theory. First, we focus on perturbation theory, which is more suitable than nonperturbative techniques due to the specific temporal non-locality of the model after disorder integration. We compute the one-loop $\beta$-function and explore the structure of its fixed points. Next, we develop the nonperturbative renormalization group approach based on the standard Wetterich-Morris formalism, using two approximation schemes to address the model's non-locality. We investigate the vertex expansion in the symmetric phase and assess the reliability of the approximations for the fixed-point solutions. Finally, we extend our analysis beyond the symmetric phase by using an expansion around the vacuum of the local potential. Our numerical investigations particularly focus on the cases $p = 2$ and $p=3$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bryan Verhoef, Rutger Hermsen, Joost de Graaf</p>
            <p>Bacterial colonies can form a wide variety of shapes and structures based on ambient and internal conditions. To help understand the mechanisms that determine the structure of and the diversity within these colonies, various numerical modeling techniques have been applied. The most commonly used ones are continuum models, agent-based models, and lattice models. Continuum models are usually computationally fast, but disregard information at the level of the individual, which can be crucial to understanding diversity in a colony. Agent-based models resolve local details to a greater level, but are computationally costly. Lattice-based approaches strike a balance between these two limiting cases. However, this is known to come at the price of introducing undesirable artifacts into the structure of the colonies. For instance, square lattices tend to produce square colonies even where an isotropic shape is expected. Here, we aim to overcome these limitations and therefore study lattice-induced orientational symmetry in a class of hybrid numerical methods that combine aspects of lattice-based and continuum descriptions. We characterize these artifacts and show that they can be circumvented through the use of a disordered lattice which derives from an unstructured fluid. The main advantage of this approach is that the lattice itself does not imbue the colony with a preferential directionality. We demonstrate that our implementation enables the study of colony growth involving millions of individuals within hours of computation time on an ordinary desktop computer, while retaining many of the desirable features of agent-based models. Furthermore, our method can be readily adapted for a wide range of applications, opening up new avenues for studying the formation of colonies with diverse shapes and complex internal interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Mudry, Ömer M. Aksoy, Claudio Chamon, Akira Furusaki</p>
            <p>The anisotropic quantum spin-1/2 XY model on a linear chain was solved by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1961 and shown to display a continuous quantum phase transition at the O(2) symmetric point separating two gapped phases with competing Ising long-range order. For the square lattice, the following is known. The two competing Ising ordered phases extend to finite temperatures, up to a boundary where a transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, and meet at the O(2) symmetric critical line along the temperature axis that ends at a tricritical point at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature where the two competing phases meet the paramagnetic phase. We show that the first-order zero-temperature (quantum) phase transition that separates the competing phases as a function of the anisotropy parameter is smoothed by thermal fluctuations into deconfined classical criticality.</p>

            <p>The exact recursion relations are used to study the mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2) Blume-Capel Ising ferrimagnetic system on the Bethe lattice. Ground-state phase diagrams are computed in the $({D_{A}}/{q|J|}, {D_{B}}/{q|J|})$ plane to reveal different possible ground states of the model. Using the thermal changes of the order-parameters, interesting temperature dependent phase diagrams are constructed in the ($D_{A}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$), ($D_{B}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) planes as well as in the ($D/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) plane where $D=D_A=D_B$. It is revealed that the system exhibits first- and second-order phase transitions and compensation temperatures for specific model parameter values. Under the constraint of an external magnetic field, the model also produces multi-hysteresis behaviors as single, double and triple hysteresis cycles. Particularly, the impacts of the ferrimagnetic coupling $J$ on the remanent magnetization and the coercitive fields for selected values of the other physical parameters of the system are pointed out. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with those reported in the literature.</p>

            <p>Water exhibits complex behaviors as a result of hydrogen bonding, and low-dimensional confined water plays a key role in material science, geology, and biology science. Conventional techniques like STM, TEM, and AFM enable atomic-scale observations but face limitations under ambient conditions and surface topographies. NV center magnetic resonance technology provides an opportunity to overcome these limitations, offering non-contact atomic-scale measurements with chemical resolution capability. In this study, a nanoscale layer dissection method was developed utilizing NV center technology to analyze water layers with diverse physicochemical properties. It unveiled the presence of a non-evaporating sub-nanometer water layer on a diamond surface under ambient conditions. This layer demonstrated impervious to atmospheric water vapor and exhibited unique electronic transport mediated via hydrogen bonding. These findings provide new perspectives and a platform for studying the structure and behavior of low-dimensional water, as well as the surface properties influenced by adsorbed water under native conditions.</p>

            <p>Controlling the domain structure of ferroic materials is key to manipulating their functionality. Typically, quasi-static electric, magnetic, or strain fields are exploited to transform or pole ferroic domains. In contrast, metallurgy makes use of fast thermal quenches across phase transitions to create new functional states and domain structures. This approach employs the rapid temporal evolution of systems far from equilibrium to overcome the constraints imposed by comparably slow interactions. However, guiding the nonequilibrium evolution of domains towards otherwise inaccessible configurations remains largely unexplored in ferroics. Here, we harness thermal quenches to exert control over a ferroic domain pattern. Cooling at variable speed triggers transitions between two ferroic phases in a rare-earth orthoferrite, with transient domain evolution enabling the selection of the final domain pattern. Specifically, by tuning the quench rate, we can either generate the intrinsic domain structure of the low-temperature phase or transfer the original pattern of the high-temperature phase - creating a hidden metastable domain configuration inaccessible at thermal equilibrium. Real-time imaging during rapid quenching reveals two distinct time scales governing domain evolution: a fast fragmentation phase, followed by a slower relaxation towards a new pattern or back to the original one. This dynamic control of domain configurations, alongside external fields, strain engineering, and all-optical switching, offers a novel approach for actively manipulating ferroic order.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</p>

            <p>Building on the multiband nature of iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), we have uncovered pronounced anisotropy in Majorana vortex topology arising from the interaction between vortex orientation and multiple electronic topologies. This anisotropy manifests in two distinct vortex configurations: the z-vortex and x-vortex, oriented perpendicular and parallel to the Dirac axis (z-axis for FeSCs), respectively. The x-vortex exhibits a unique duality, displaying two distinct topological phase diagrams. One is strikingly simple, comprising only trivial and topological superconducting phases, and remains resilient to multiband entanglement. The other mirrors the z-vortex's complex diagram, featuring alternating trivial, topological crystalline and topological superconducting phases. Crucially, the former is exclusive to the x-vortex and supports unpaired Majorana vortices across a wide parameter range, even with Dirac nodes in electronic bands. Notably, uniaxial strain can modulate these x-vortex phases, enabling the x-vortex to support both stable Majorana vortices and rich exotic physics in a controllable manner. Moreover, we propose that the x-vortex offers promising advantages for developing iron-based superconducting quantum devices. Our findings introduce a novel paradigm in vortex topology within multiband superconducting systems, highlighting the x-vortex as a promising platform for exploring Majorana physics and advancing iron-based superconducting quantum technology.</p>

            <p>Understanding hydrogen-grain boundary (GB) interactions is critical to the analysis of hydrogen embrittlement in metals. This work presents a mesoscale fully kinetic model to investigate the effect of GB misorientation on hydrogen diffusion and trapping using phase-field based representative volume elements (RVEs). The flux equation consists of three terms: a diffusive term and two terms for high and low angle grain boundary (H/LAGB) trapping. Uptake simulations showed that decreasing the grain size resulted in higher hydrogen content due to increasing the GB density. Permeation simulations showed that GBs are high flux paths due to their higher enrichment with hydrogen. Since HAGBs have higher enrichment than LAGBs, due to their higher trap-binding energy, they generally have the highest hydrogen flux. Nevertheless, the flux shows a convoluted behavior as it depends on the local concentration, alignment of GB with external concentration gradient as well as the GB network connectivity. Finally, decreasing the grain size resulted in a larger break-through time and a larger steady-state exit flux.</p>

Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and alters the state of the magnetic moment at a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons dominates the superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni units consisting of five spins that are decoupled from the rest of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO lattice and exhibit degenerate spin states. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy measurements on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design could potentially advance quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-qubits.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seán R. Kavanagh</p>
            <p>Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</p>

            <h2>Multiplicative Chern insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Archi Banerjee, Michał J. Pacholski, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reyhan Ay, Adipta Pal, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Gauge field fluctuation corrected QED3 effective action by fermionic particle-vortex duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Han Hsiao</p>
            <p>We present a non-perturbative framework for incorporating gauge field fluctuations into effective actions of QED3 in the infrared using fermionic particle-vortex duality. This approach is demonstrated through the applications to models containing N species of 2-component Dirac fermions in solvable and interpretable electromagnetic backgrounds, focusing on N = 1 or 2. For the N = 1 model, we establish a correspondence between fermion Casimir energy at finite density and the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, and further evaluate the corrections to their amplitudes. This predicts amplification of charge susceptibility and reduction of magnetic permeability. We additionally provide physical interpretations for each component of our calculation and offer alternative derivations based on energy density measurements in different characteristic lengths. For N = 2, we show that magnetic catalysis is erased in a U(1)xU(1) QED3, indicating no breakdown of chiral symmetry. Reasoning is offered based on the properties of the lowest Landau level wave functions.</p>

            <p>We calculate the typical bipartite entanglement entropy $\langle S_A\rangle_N$ in systems containing indistinguishable particles of any kind as a function of the total particle number $N$, the volume $V$, and the subsystem fraction $f=V_A/V$, where $V_A$ is the volume of the subsystem. We expand our result as a power series $\langle S_A\rangle_N=a f V+b\sqrt{V}+c+o(1)$, and find that $c$ is universal (i.e., independent of the system type), while $a$ and $b$ can be obtained from a generating function characterizing the local Hilbert space dimension. We illustrate the generality of our findings by studying a wide range of different systems, e.g., bosons, fermions, spins, and mixtures thereof. We provide evidence that our analytical results describe the entanglement entropy of highly excited eigenstates of quantum-chaotic spin and boson systems, which is distinct from that of integrable counterparts.</p>

            <p>This work investigates adversarial training in the context of margin-based linear classifiers in the high-dimensional regime where the dimension $d$ and the number of data points $n$ diverge with a fixed ratio $\alpha = n / d$. We introduce a tractable mathematical model where the interplay between the data and adversarial attacker geometries can be studied, while capturing the core phenomenology observed in the adversarial robustness literature. Our main theoretical contribution is an exact asymptotic description of the sufficient statistics for the adversarial empirical risk minimiser, under generic convex and non-increasing losses for a Block Feature Model. Our result allow us to precisely characterise which directions in the data are associated with a higher generalisation/robustness trade-off, as defined by a robustness and a usefulness metric. We show that the the presence of multiple different feature types is crucial to the high sample complexity performances of adversarial training. In particular, we unveil the existence of directions which can be defended without penalising accuracy. Finally, we show the advantage of defending non-robust features during training, identifying a uniform protection as an inherently effective defence mechanism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Bai, Akihiro Miyata, Masahiro Nozaki</p>
            <p>We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.</p>

            <h2>Gravity from entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime {to a quantum operator, playing the role of an renormalizable effective density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-Kähler formalism, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the {\em G-field}, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remain second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</p>

            <h2>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohit P. Dalwadi</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergent three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. We also demonstrate that this effective asymmetry generated by the rapid yawing can cause chaotic behaviour in the emergent dynamics, in stark contrast to the emergent dynamics generated by rapidly rotating spheroids, which are equivalent to those of effective passive spheroids. In general, we find that the shape of the equivalent effective particle under rapid yawing is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. In these scenarios, we calculate analytically the equivalent aspect ratio of the effective spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Filippo Ferrari, Fabrizio Minganti, Camille Aron, Vincenzo Savona</p>
            <p>Thermalization in quantum many-body systems, the process by which they naturally evolve toward thermal equilibrium, typically unfolds over timescales set by the underlying relaxation mechanisms. Yet, the spatial aspect of thermalization in these systems is less understood. We investigate this phenomenon within the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of a Bose-Hubbard chain subject at its boundaries to coherent driving and dissipation, a setup inspired by current designs in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We uncover a two-stage thermalization process along the spatial dimension. Close to the coherent drive, the U(1) symmetry of the phase of the photonic field is restored over a short length scale, while its amplitude relaxes over a much larger scale. This opens up an extensive region of the chain where the photon density remains high, and the chaotic dynamics give rise to a hydrodynamic regime, characterized by local equilibria with a large and slowly-varying effective chemical potential. Dynamical fingerprints of chaos in this NESS are probed using semiclassical out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) within the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA). We explore the conditions underlying this protracted thermalization in space and argue that similar prethermal chaotic phases are likely to occur in a broad range of extended driven-dissipative systems.</p>

            <p>Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influence the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully adjustable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show a quantum simulator system that consists of a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity that can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout, based on a tunnel Josephson junction circuit, of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work is a first step for the development of analog molecule simulators of proton transfer reactions based on quantum superconducting circuits.</p>

The figure of merit we employ is the local ergotropy. We perform a complete analysis in the whole range of the system's parameters. This way, we prove that superpositions of two current states in spatially closed spin networks are characterized by specific peaks in extractable energy, generally overcoming the ergotropy of each of the two separate current states characterized by a single winding number. The many-body state dynamics entails to ergotropy evolving in a controlled fashion. The implementation we suggest is based on a Rydberg-atom platform. Optimal transformations able to extract locally the maximum possible amount of energy are sorted out.</p>

            <p>Integrating robotically driven contact-based material characterization techniques into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality, reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high-throughputs. Firstly, we design a vision-based, self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses differentiable image priors to optimize domain-specific objectives, refining the pixel precision of predicted robot contact poses by 20.0% relative to existing approaches. Secondly, we design a reliable graph-based planner for generating distance-minimizing paths to accelerate the robot measurement throughput and decrease planning variance by 6x. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3,025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing process defects. With this self-supervised CNN-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.</p>

            <p>Cement production, exceeding 4.1 billion tonnes and contributing 2.4 tonnes of CO2 annually, faces critical challenges in quality control and process optimization. While traditional process models for cement manufacturing are confined to steady-state conditions with limited predictive capability for mineralogical phases, modern plants operate under dynamic conditions that demand real-time quality assessment. Here, exploiting a comprehensive two-year operational dataset from an industrial cement plant, we present a machine learning framework that accurately predicts clinker mineralogy from process data. Our model achieves unprecedented prediction accuracy for major clinker phases while requiring minimal input parameters, demonstrating robust performance under varying operating conditions. Through post-hoc explainable algorithms, we interpret the hierarchical relationships between clinker oxides and phase formation, providing insights into the functioning of an otherwise black-box model. This digital twin framework can potentially enable real-time optimization of cement production, thereby providing a route toward reducing material waste and ensuring quality while reducing the associated emissions under real plant conditions. Our approach represents a significant advancement in industrial process control, offering a scalable solution for sustainable cement manufacturing.</p>

            <h2>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinay Patil, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Ashley M. Cook</p>
            <p>Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Description of the Relaxation Dynamics and Dynamical Heterogeneity of an Active Glass-forming Liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhodeep Dey, Smarajit Karmakar</p>
            <p>Active glasses refer to a class of driven non-equilibrium systems that share remarkably similar dynamical behavior as conventional glass-formers in equilibrium. Glass-like dynamical characteristics have been observed in various biological systems from micro to macro length scales. As activity induces additional fluctuations in the system, studying how they couple with density fluctuations is an interesting question to address. Via extensive molecular dynamics simulations, We show that activity enhances density fluctuations more strongly than its passive counterpart. Increasing activity beyond a limit results in the sub-Arrhenieus-type relaxation behavior in active glasses. We also propose a unified scaling theory that can rationalize the relaxation spectrum over a broad parameter range using the concept of an effective temperature. In particular, we show that our scaling theory can capture the dynamical crossover from super to sub-Arrhenius relaxation behavior by changing activity from small to large values. Furthermore, We present non-trivial system size dependencies of the relaxation time at large activity limits that have not been found in any passive systems or even in active systems at small activities.</p>

            <p>Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.</p>

Among them, CrSBr is a semiconductor that stands out, owing to its high Curie temperature (TC ~ 146 K), air stability and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the effects of Dy doping (12.5%, 25%, and 50%) on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of CrSBr monolayer. Our results reveal that Dy incorporation enhances magnetic anisotropy, modulates TC, and can create quasi-1D ferromagnetic chains that arise from competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Additionally, we investigate the properties of DySBr, DySI and DySeI monolayers, which are isostructural to the CrSBr. Our results reveal the feasibility of exfoliating them down to the single-layer and the presence of long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, relying on the combination of both weak exchange interactions and large spin-orbit coupling. This work provides insights into tuning the properties of CrSBr through rare earth doping, unlocking new possibilities for advanced applications at the 2D limit.</p>

            <p>In studying compensated semimetals, the two-band model has proven extremely useful to capture electrical conductivities with intuitive parameters of densities and mobilities of electron-like and hole-like carriers, as well as to predict their magnetic field dependence. Yet, it rarely offers practical insight into magneto-thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the field dependence of thermoelectric (TE) coefficients in a highly compensated semimetal NbSb$_2$, where we find the Seebeck ($S_{xx}$) and Nernst ($S_{xy}$) coefficients increase quadratically and linearly with field, respectively. Such field dependences were predicted by the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory and the Mott relation of the two-band system, and they are realized when two conditions are simultaneously met [1]: the multiple of cyclotron frequency ($\omega_c$) and relaxation time ($\tau$) is much larger than one, $\omega_c\tau \gg 1$ and the tangent of Hall angle ($\theta_H$) is much smaller than one, $\tan\theta_H \ll 1$. We use the relation between two carrier densities $n_e$ (electron-like) and $n_h$ (hole-like) derived from the field dependence of the TE coefficients, to refine the two-band model fittings. The compensation factor ($\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}$, where $\Delta n = n_e-n_h$) is found two orders of magnitude smaller than what was found in the unrestricted fitting and hence the larger saturation field scale for magnetoresistance. Within the framework of the semiclassical theory, we deduce that the thermoelectric Hall angle $\tan\theta_{\gamma} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}$ can be expressed $\big(\frac{|\Delta n|}{n_e}\times \omega_c\tau\big)^{-1}$. Our findings offer crucial insights not only for identifying the empirical conditions for the field-induced enhancement of the TE performance but also for engineering efficient thermoelectric devices based on semimetallic materials.</p>

The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system.

            <p>Although the search for quantum many-body phenomena in magnetic materials has a strong focus on highly frustrated systems, even unfrustrated quantum magnets show a multitude of unconventional phenomena in their spin excitation spectra. YbBr$_3$ is an excellent realization of the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, and we have performed detailed spectroscopic experiments with both unpolarized and polarized neutrons at all applied magnetic fields up to saturation. We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity in Nanosystems: A Fruitful Path to New Phenomenology in Quantum Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.V. Ramallo</p>
            <p>We reason that various recent works by different groups reporting new phenomenologies in superconductors can be understood in a unifying way as instances of the appearance of novel competitions (or synergies in some cases) between the coexisting orders at play in superconducting materials. In particular, we argue that the main common feature of such phenomenologies is to have emerged from the induction, by nanoengineering, of novel characteristic lengths for each order, or of custom regular spatial patterns affecting them. We claim, thus, that a fruitful path to discover new phenomenology is opened by these and future searches of novel nanostructurations of superconducting materials.</p>

            <h2>Physically Intuitive Anisotropic Model of Hardness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Faridun N. Jalolov, Alexander G. Kvashnin</p>
            <p>The hardness of materials plays an important role in material design. There are numerous experimental methods to measure the hardness of materials, but theoretical prediction of hardness is challenging. By investigating the correlation between hardness and the elastic properties of materials, namely shear and bulk moduli, the pressure derivative of bulk modulus, we have constructed a simple and physically intuitive hardness model. By introducing the spatial variation of the shear modulus, it is possible to predict the hardness anisotropy of materials to define the minimum and maximum values of hardness possessed by a particular material. Furthermore, by using the equation of states to define the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus, it is possible to determine the temperature dependencies of hardness for given materials. All quantities in the model can be obtained directly from accurate first-principles calculations or from experiments, making it suitable for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>A unified and consistent electrical double layer model for treatment of core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeeshan Ahmad</p>
            <p>The electrical double layer (EDL) is fundamental to the operation of devices for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Existing models of EDL in solid electrolytes focus predominantly on the space charge layer and lack a complete treatment of the core layer which is an integral part of the EDL. The core layer exhibits significant variations in defect properties, such as defect formation energy (DFE), which influence the ionic charge carrier distribution in the space charge layer. In this work, we develop a general framework for treating both the core and space charge layer in solid electrolytes under dilute and concentrated regimes. We incorporate functional forms of the DFE variation in the core layer and defect-defect interactions that are consistent with previous first-principles simulations of solid electrolytes at surfaces and interfaces. Our simulations reveal that the core layer significantly impacts the potential distribution and defect concentrations in the solid electrolyte. In addition, the core contributes substantially to the conductivity when the surface DFE is much lower than the bulk DFE. Our model paves the way for accurate calculations of properties such as capacitance and ionic conductivity of solid-solid interfaces required for enhancing and optimizing the performance of solid-state electrochemical devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.M. Botana, M.V.Ramallo</p>
            <p>We study the critical fluctuations near the resistive transition of very thin films of high-temperature cuprate superconductors composed of a number $N$ of only a few unit cells of superconducting bilayers. For that, we solve the fluctuation spectrum of a Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau model for few-bilayers superconductors considering two alternating Josephson interlayer interaction strengths, and we obtain the corresponding paraconductivity above the transition. Then, we extend these calculations to temperatures below the transition through expressions for the Ginzburg number and Kosterlitz--Thouless-like critical region. When compared with previously available data in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ few-bilayers systems, with $N=1$ to $4$, our results seem to provide a plausible scenario for their critical regime.</p>

            <p>In this study, we explore the topological properties of the photon-dressed energy bands in bilayer $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices, focusing on both aligned and cyclic stacking configurations under the influence of off-resonant circularly polarized light. We derive precise analytical expressions for the quasi-energy bands in the aligned stacking case, while numerical results for cyclic stacking are obtained at the Dirac points. Our findings reveal that the time-reversal symmetry breaking caused by circularly polarized light completely lifts the degeneracy at the $t^{a,c}$-point intersections at these Dirac points. To investigate the topological signatures of the driven $\alpha-T_{3}$ lattices, we examine the Berry phase through anomalous magnetic and thermal responses. Notably, at $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, we find that the orbital magnetic moments associated with both corrugated and flat bands exhibit opposite signs, along with their Berry curvatures. For values of $0 < \alpha < 1$, off-resonant light induces deformations in the bands near the Dirac points, leading to two equally sized gaps in the quasi-energy spectrum. The position of the chemical potential within these gaps significantly influences the orbital magnetization. We observe that linear variations in magnetization correlate with Chern numbers on either side of $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$. These topological features manifest as distinct quantized values of anomalous Hall conductivity across both stacking types...</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuntal Talit, David A. Strubbe</p>
            <p>The mechanical properties of hybrid perovskite materials are important for device flexibility, resistance to fracture, epitaxial growth, surface energetics of quantum dots, and induction or relief of stress in thin films due to thermal expansion and phase changes. These issues are particularly salient for solar cells in space applications. Nonetheless, few studies are available on the mechanical properties of the paradigmatic hybrid perovskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ (MAPI). Experimental results are only available for the room-temperature tetragonal phase, and there are significant discrepancies among them. Results from density functional theory (DFT) are available for all three phases but have even larger discrepancies from each other and from experiments. To clarify the disorder in the literature, we have studied the elastic properties of all three phases in detail with DFT calculations. We have examined the effect of different aspects in calculation methodology such as use of energy or stress, the structure, exchange-correlation functionals, Van der Waals corrections, pseudopotentials, $k$-point sampling, and formulas for anisotropic elasticity and polycrystalline averages. Our results provide accurate reference values and an appropriate general methodology for elastic properties of metal halide perovskites.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Yang, Gia-Wei Chern</p>
            <p>The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</p>

            <p>In strongly correlated materials, interacting electrons are entangled and form collective quantum states, resulting in rich low-temperature phase diagrams. Notable examples include cuprate superconductors, in which superconductivity emerges at low doping out of an unusual ``pseudogap'' metallic state above the critical temperature. The Fermi-Hubbard model, describing a wide range of phenomena associated with strong electron correlations, still offers major computational challenges despite its simple formulation. In this context, ultracold atoms quantum simulators have provided invaluable insights into the microscopic nature of correlated quantum states. Here, we use a quantum gas microscope Fermi-Hubbard simulator to explore a wide range of doping levels and temperatures in a regime where a pseudogap is known to develop. By measuring multi-point correlation functions up to fifth order, we uncover a novel universal behaviour in magnetic and higher-order spin-charge correlations. This behaviour is characterized by a doping-dependent energy scale that governs the exponential growth of the magnetic correlation length upon cooling. Accurate comparisons with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States simulations confirm that this energy scale agrees well with the pseudogap temperature $T^{*}$. Our findings establish a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the magnetic origin and physical nature of the pseudogap and pave the way towards the exploration of pairing and collective phenomena among charge carriers expected to emerge at lower temperatures.</p>

            <p>Understanding the geometric properties of quantum states and their implications in fundamental physical phenomena is at the core of modern physics. The Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT) is a central physical object in this regard, encoding complete information about the geometry of the quantum state. The imaginary part of the QGT is the well-known Berry curvature, which plays a fundamental role in the topological magnetoelectric and optoelectronic phenomena. The real part of the QGT is the quantum metric, whose importance has come to prominence very recently, giving rise to a new set of quantum geometric phenomena, such as anomalous Landau levels, flat band superfluidity, excitonic Lamb shifts, and nonlinear Hall effect. Despite the central importance of the QGT, its experimental measurements have been restricted only to artificial two-level systems. In this work, we develop a framework to measure the QGT (both quantum metric and Berry curvature) in crystalline solids using polarization-, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Using this framework, we demonstrate the effective reconstruction of the QGT in solids in the archetype kagome metal CoSn, which hosts topological flat bands. The key idea is to introduce another geometrical tensor, the quasi-QGT, whose components, the band Drude weight and orbital angular momentum, are experimentally accessible and can be used for extracting the QGT. Establishing such a momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopic probe of the QGT is poised to significantly advance our understanding of quantum geometric responses in a wide range of crystalline systems.</p>

            <h2>Robust Spectral Anomaly Detection in EELS Spectral Images via Three Dimensional Convolutional Variational Autoencoders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyfal Sultanov, James P Buban, Robert F Klie</p>
            <p>We introduce a Three-Dimensional Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (3D-CVAE) for automated anomaly detection in Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy Spectrum Imaging (EELS-SI) data. Our approach leverages the full three-dimensional structure of EELS-SI data to detect subtle spectral anomalies while preserving both spatial and spectral correlations across the datacube. By employing negative log-likelihood loss and training on bulk spectra, the model learns to reconstruct bulk features characteristic of the defect-free material. In exploring methods for anomaly detection, we evaluated both our 3D-CVAE approach and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), testing their performance using Fe L-edge peak shifts designed to simulate material defects. Our results show that 3D-CVAE achieves superior anomaly detection and maintains consistent performance across various shift magnitudes. The method demonstrates clear bimodal separation between normal and anomalous spectra, enabling reliable classification. Further analysis verifies that lower dimensional representations are robust to anomalies in the data. While performance advantages over PCA diminish with decreasing anomaly concentration, our method maintains high reconstruction quality even in challenging, noise-dominated spectral regions. This approach provides a robust framework for unsupervised automated detection of spectral anomalies in EELS-SI data, particularly valuable for analyzing complex material systems.</p>

            <p>Behavioral experiments on the ultimatum game (UG) reveal that we humans prefer fair acts, which contradicts the prediction made in orthodox Economics. Existing explanations, however, are mostly attributed to exogenous factors within the imitation learning framework. Here, we adopt the reinforcement learning paradigm, where individuals make their moves aiming to maximize their accumulated rewards. Specifically, we apply Q-learning to UG, where each player is assigned two Q-tables to guide decisions for the roles of proposer and responder. In a two-player scenario, fairness emerges prominently when both experiences and future rewards are appreciated. In particular, the probability of successful deals increases with higher offers, which aligns with observations in behavioral experiments. Our mechanism analysis reveals that the system undergoes two phases, eventually stabilizing into fair or rational strategies. These results are robust when the rotating role assignment is replaced by a random or fixed manner, or the scenario is extended to a latticed population. Our findings thus conclude that the endogenous factor is sufficient to explain the emergence of fairness, exogenous factors are not needed.</p>

The thin-layer geometry of the system provides anisotropy in the interaction rate, enabling directional sensitivity.

            <p>Supersymmetry provides a natural playground for the construction of kinetically constrained lattice fermion models showing weak ergodicity breaking. The supersymmetric algebra naturally induces non-ergodic dynamics, as we illustrate here by introducing a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with an adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model. Supersymmetry directly implies that the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states, including the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product state. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic toy model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel by uncovering quantum many-body scar-like eigenstates obeying sub-thermal entanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of integers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model.</p>

            <p>The Epstein zeta function generalizes the Riemann zeta function to oscillatory lattice sums in higher dimensions. Beyond its numerous applications in pure mathematics, it has recently been identified as a key component in simulating exotic quantum materials. This work establishes the Epstein zeta function as a powerful tool in numerical analysis by rigorously investigating its analytical properties and enabling its efficient computation. Specifically, we derive a compact and computationally efficient representation of the Epstein zeta function and thoroughly examine its analytical properties across all arguments. Furthermore, we introduce a superexponentially convergent algorithm, complete with error bounds, for computing the Epstein zeta function in arbitrary dimensions. We also show that the Epstein zeta function can be decomposed into a power law singularity and an analytic function in the first Brillouin zone. This decomposition facilitates the rapid evaluation of integrals involving the Epstein zeta function and allows for efficient precomputations through interpolation techniques. We present the first high-performance implementation of the Epstein zeta function and its regularisation for arbitrary real arguments in EpsteinLib, a C library with Python and Mathematica bindings, and rigorously benchmark its precision and performance against known formulas, achieving full precision across the entire parameter range. Finally, we apply our library to the computation of quantum dispersion relations of three-dimensional spin materials with long-range interactions and Casimir energies in multidimensional geometries, uncovering higher-order corrections to known asymptotic formulas for the arising forces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang He, Vassiliy Lubchenko</p>
            <p>We construct a thermodynamic potential that can guide training of a generative model defined on a set of binary degrees of freedom. We argue that upon reduction in description, so as to make the generative model computationally-manageable, the potential develops multiple minima. This is mirrored by the emergence of multiple minima in the free energy proper of the generative model itself. The variety of training samples that employ N binary degrees of freedom is ordinarily much lower than the size 2^N of the full phase space. The non-represented configurations, we argue, should be thought of as comprising a high-temperature phase separated by an extensive energy gap from the configurations composing the training set. Thus, training amounts to sampling a free energy surface in the form of a library of distinct bound states, each of which breaks ergodicity. The ergodicity breaking prevents escape into the near continuum of states comprising the high-temperature phase; thus it is necessary for proper functionality. It may however have the side effect of limiting access to patterns that were underrepresented in the training set. At the same time, the ergodicity breaking within the library complicates both learning and retrieval. As a remedy, one may concurrently employ multiple generative models -- up to one model per free energy minimum.</p>

            <h2>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentin Benedetti, Horacio Casini, Javier M. Magan</p>
            <p>Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c<1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</p>

            <p>The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this Letter, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically solve our model for degree correlation and validate the theoretical predictions against empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Colmenarez, Seyong Kim, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. We observe that the erasure errors enter as a classical average over fully depolarizing channels. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a $50\%$ threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds under realistic noise and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence in superconducting circuits has increased steadily over the last decades as a result of a growing understanding of the various loss mechanisms. Recently, tantalum (Ta) emerged as a promising material to address microscopic sources of loss found on niobium (Nb) or aluminum (Al) surfaces. However, the effects of film and interface microstructure on low-temperature microwave loss are still not well understood. Here we present a systematic study of the structural and electrical properties of Ta and Nb films sputtered on c-plane sapphire at varying growth temperatures. As growth temperature is increased, our results show that the onset of epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-phase Ta correlates with lower Ta surface roughness, higher critical temperature, and higher residual resistivity ratio, but surprisingly also correlates with a significant increase in loss at microwave frequency. We determine that the source of loss is located at the Ta/sapphire interface and show that it can be fully mitigated by either growing a thin, epitaxial Nb inter-layer between the Ta film and the substrate or by intentionally treating the sapphire surface with \textit{in-situ} argon plasma before Ta growth. In addition to elucidating this interfacial microwave loss, this work provides adequate process details that should allow for the reproducible growth of low-loss Ta film across fabrication facilities.</p>

However, developing machine-learned interatomic potentials requires high-quality training data, and the manual generation and curation of such data can be a major bottleneck. Here, we introduce an automated framework for the exploration and fitting of potential-energy surfaces, implemented in an openly available software package that we call autoplex (`automatic potential-landscape explorer'). We discuss design choices, particularly the interoperability with existing software architectures, and the ability for the end user to easily use the computational workflows provided. We show wide-ranging capability demonstrations: for the titanium-oxygen system, SiO2, crystalline and liquid water, as well as phase-change memory materials. More generally, our study illustrates how automation can speed up atomistic machine learning -- with a long-term vision of making it a genuine mainstream tool in physics, chemistry, and materials science.</p>

            <p>We review the construction by Bouch [1] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ is the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C>1$ is a constant.

            <h2>Fluctuations and optimal control in a Floquet Quantum Thermal Transistor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samir Das, Shishira Mahunta, Nikhil Gupt, Victor Mukherjee, Arnab Ghosh</p>
            <p>We use Full Counting Statistics to study fluctuations and optimal control in a three-terminal Floquet quantum thermal transistor. We model the setup using three qubits (termed as the emitter, collector and base) coupled to three thermal baths. As shown in Phys. Rev. E 106, 024110 (2022), one can achieve significant change in the emitter and collector currents through a small change in the base current, thereby achieving a thermal transistor operation. Using sinusoidal and pi-flip modulations of the base qubit frequency, we show that the variance of the base current is much less compared to those of the emitter and collector currents, while the opposite is true in case of the Fano factor. We then apply optimal control through the Chopped Random Basis optimization protocol, in order to significantly enhance the amplification obtained in the transistor. In contrast, a reduction in the Fano factor of the setup through optimal control is associated with a large base current, thereby suggesting a trade-off between precision and base current. We expect our results will be relevant for developing heat modulation devices in near-term quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>A tensor network formulation of Lattice Gauge Theories based only on symmetric tensors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manu Canals, Natalia Chepiga, Luca Tagliacozzo</p>
            <p>The Lattice Gauge Theory Hilbert space is divided into gauge-invariant sectors selected by the background charges. Such a projector can be directly embedded in a tensor network ansatz for gauge-invariant states as originally discussed in [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115127 (2011)] and in [Phys. Rev. X 4, 041024 (2014)] in the context of PEPS. The original ansatz is based on sparse tensors, though parts of them are not explicitly symmetric, and thus their actual implementation in numerical simulations has been hindered by the complexity of developing ad hoc libraries. Here we provide a new PEPS tensor network formulation of gauge-invariant theories purely based on symmetric elementary tensors. The new formulation can be implemented in numerical simulation using available state-of-the-art tensor network libraries but also holds interest from a purely theoretical perspective since it requires embedding the original gauge theory with gauge symmetry G into an enlarged globally symmetric theory with symmetry GxG. By revisiting the original ansatz in the modern landscape of i) duality transformations between gauge and spin systems, ii) finite depth quantum circuits followed by measurements that allow generating topologically ordered states, and iii) Clifford enhanced tensor networks, we show that such a new formulation provides a novel duality transformation between lattice gauge theories and specific sectors of globally invariant systems.</p>

            <p>In this letter, we present the first fully analytic derivation and implementation of nuclear gradients for the G$_0$W$_0$ method. For this, we leverage the recently established connection between the G$_0$W$_0$ approach and equation-of-motion unitary coupled-cluster theory for charged excitations [J. Chem.

For G$_0$W$_0$, we examine the effect of the Tamm--Dancoff approximation for evaluating the screened Coulomb interaction. Finally, we compare G$_0$W$_0$ adiabatic ionization potential and electron affinities to wavefunction-based electronic structure methods, and experimental values.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaehyeok Jin, Gregory A. Voth</p>
            <p>Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</p>

            <h2>An accurate and efficient framework for predictive insights into ionic surface chemistry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin X. Shi, Andrew S. Rosen, Tobias Schäfer, Andreas Grüneis, Venkat Kapil, Andrea Zen, Angelos Michaelides</p>
            <p>Quantum-mechanical simulations can offer atomic-level insights into chemical processes on surfaces. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of new solid catalysts as well as materials to store energy and mitigate greenhouse gases. However, achieving the accuracy needed for reliable predictions has proven challenging. Density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse quantum-mechanical method, can often lead to inconsistent predictions, necessitating accurate methods from correlated wave-function theory (cWFT). However, the high computational demands and significant user intervention associated with cWFT have traditionally made it impractical to carry out for surfaces. In this work, we address this challenge, presenting an automated framework which leverages multilevel embedding approaches, to apply accurate cWFT methods to ionic surfaces with computational costs approaching DFT. With this framework, we have reproduced experimental adsorption enthalpies for a diverse set of 19 adsorbate-surface systems. Moreover, we resolve long-standing debates on the adsorption configuration of several systems, while offering valuable benchmarks to assess DFT. This framework is completely open-source, making it possible to now routinely apply cWFT to complex problems in ionic surface chemistry.</p>

            <h2>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenzhu Xie, Yong Zhang</p>
            <p>To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and heart-like shapes, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</p>

            <h2>Measurement of the work statistics of an open quantum system using a quantum computer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Michele Campisi</p>
            <p>We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Shape and Performance of Fastest Paths over Networks with Interacting Selfish Agents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Cogoni, Giovanni Busonera, Enrico Gobbetti</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of the fastest paths in transportation networks under increasing congestion, modeled as a linear decrease in edge travel speed with density due to interactions among selfish agents. Moving from the common edge-based to a path-based analysis, we examine the fastest directed routes connecting random origin-destination pairs as traffic grows, characterizing their shape through effective length, maximum detour, and area under the curve, and their performance through a novel metric measuring how fast and how far an agent travels toward its destination. The entire network is characterized by analyzing the performance metric's distribution across uniformly distributed paths. The study covers both random planar networks with controlled characteristics and real urban networks of major cities. The low-density network regime, in which an initial smooth performance degradation is observed up to a critical traffic volume, is followed by the emergence of complex patterns of spatially heterogeneous slowdowns as traffic increases, rapidly leading to disjoint subnetworks. The failure of a few edges leads to a catastrophic decrease in the network performance. The fastest paths for all cities show a peak for detour and inness (and their variance) in the proximity of the critical traffic level, defined as the flex of the rejected path ratio curve. Inness generally shows a slight attraction by city centers on paths for light traffic, but this reverses to strong repulsion during congestion. We exploit path performance to uncover an asymmetric behavior of different regions of the networks when acting as origins or destinations. Finally, the Gini coefficient is used to study the unequal effects of path performance degradation with traffic.</p>

            <h2>The Fractional Hall hierarchy from duality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristan Jensen, Amir Raz</p>
            <p>We show that a modified version of Son's Dirac composite fermion theory proposed by Seiberg et al gives a candidate unified description of the gapped and gapless fractional quantum Hall states within a single Landau level. Our main tool is the successive application of three-dimensional dualities to partially filled Landau levels of composite fermions, which imply that this theory has a complicated landscape of gapped vacua and critical points. This construction is the Lagrangian, or effective field theory, analogue of the flux attachment procedure. The critical points exist at even denominator filling and are well-described by a Fermi surface for a weakly coupled composite fermion coupled to an abelian Chern-Simons theory. The gapped states include odd-denominator filling fraction states with an abelian Chern-Simons description which we show matches the one expected for hierarchy states, as well as non-abelian states at even-denominator filling that arise from pair instabilities of the composite fermion's Fermi surface.</p>

            <h2>Krylov spread complexity as holographic complexity beyond JT gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michal P. Heller, Jacopo Papalini, Tim Schuhmann</p>
            <p>One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.V. Fetisov</p>
            <p>The present study was conducted on dispersed YBa2Cu3O6+d (YBCO) during its hydration in gas-tight containers with K2CO3X1.5H2O crystal hydrate. The samples were exposed to an electromagnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz or microwave radiation of 2 GHz. Changes in the weight of various bodies located in the immediate vicinity of containers with YBCO material were detected: when above the containers, the bodies lose weight, while the weight of bodies located under the containers, on the contrary, increases. The maximum weight defect recorded in experiments with a 5 g YBCO sample was about 1 mg. Discovered weight changes are very similar to the result obtained by E.E. Podkletnov et al. [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992. V. 203. P. 441] - they observed a decrease in the weight of bodies placed above a rotating YBCO disk which was in a superconducting state and exposed to an alternating magnetic field. Podkletnov and other researchers put forward a hypothesis about screening of the gravitational field by the rotating YBCO-superconductor. Distinctive features of our experiments are the absence of the superconducting state in the YBCO material and its rotation. However, it is clear to us that we have observed the same phenomenon and, to our knowledge, this is probably the first time that Podkletnov effect has been confirmed in an independent study. Our interpretation of the effect differs from the initial one. According to our results, the YBCO material initiates a redistribution between bodies of a certain substance that affects their weight or mass.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Verlage, Friedemann Queisser, Nikodem Szpak, Jürgen König, Peter Kratzer, Ralf Schützhold</p>
            <p>As a prototypical example for a heterostructure combining a weakly and a strongly interacting quantum many-body system, we study the interface between a semiconductor and a Mott insulator. Via the hierarchy of correlations, we derive and match the propagating or evanescent (quasi) particle solutions on both sides and assume that the interactions among the electrons in the semiconducting regions can be absorbed by an effective potential. While the propagation is described by a band-like dispersion in both the weakly and the strongly interacting case, the inverse decay length across the interface follows a different dependence on the band gap in the Mott insulator and the semiconductor. As one consequence, tunnelling through a Mott insulating layer behaves quite differently from a semiconducting (or band insulating) layer. For example, we find a strong suppression of tunnelling for energies in the middle between the upper and lower Hubbard band of the Mott insulator.</p>
