            <h2>Paramagnetic Phases of Strongly Correlated Ultracold Fermions Coupled to an Optical Cavity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renan da Silva Souza, Youjiang Xu, Walter Hofstetter</p>
            <p>We numerically study a gas of two-component fermions coupled to a transversely pumped optical cavity and confined to a two-dimensional static square optical lattice. In the dispersive regime, the steady state of the system is described by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian with cavity-mediated long-range interactions. Using real-space dynamical mean-field theory (RDMFT), we investigate the formation of the (superradiant) checkerboard density-wave phase both at quarter and half filling. We focus on the paramagnetic phase assuming sufficiently high temperatures such that no magnetic long-range order develops. At quarter filling, we find a reentrant homogeneous Fermi liquid to density wave phase transition with increasing temperature, which is due to the higher entropy of the ordered phase. At half filling, in addition to the Fermi liquid to Mott insulator phase transition, marked by a vanishing quasiparticle residue at the Fermi level, we identify the transition into a density-wave phase. Due to perfect Fermi surface nesting at half filling, we find that arbitrarily small long-range interactions destabilize the system towards the density-wave phase in the absence of short-range interactions. By varying short- and long-range interactions at a fixed low temperature, we obtain the full phase diagram and identify a region of coexistence between the homogeneous Fermi liquid and Mott insulating phase with the density-wave phase. In this region, we determine the thermodynamic phase transition by comparing the energies of the different RDMFT solutions.</p>

            <h2>Anyonic Chern insulator in graphene induced by surface electromagnon vacuum fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinle Cheng, Emil Viñas Boström, Frank Y. Gao, Edoardo Baldini, Dante M. Kennes, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>Sub-wavelength cavities have emerged as a promising platform to realize strong light-matter coupling in condensed matter systems. Previous studies are limited to dielectric sub-wavelength cavities, which preserve time-reversal symmetry. Here, we lift this constraint by proposing a cavity system based on magneto-electric materials, which host surface electromagnons with non-orthogonal electric field and magnetic field components. The quantum fluctuations of the surface electromagnons drive a nearby graphene monolayer into an anyonic Chern insulator, characterized by anyonic quasi-particles and a topological gap that decays polynomially with the graphene-substrate distance. Our work opens a path to controllably break time-reversal symmetry and induce exotic quantum states through cavity vacuum fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Kapitza-Dirac interference of Higgs waves in superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daemo Kang, Tien-Tien Yeh, Takahiro Morimoto, Alexander V. Balatsky</p>
            <p>We present a novel framework for controlling Higgs mode and vortex dynamics in superconductors using structured light. We propose a phenomenon analog of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in superconductors, where Higgs waves scatter off light-induced vortex lattices, generating interference patterns akin to matter wave diffraction. We also find that the vortices enable the linear coupling of Higgs mode to the electromagnetic field. This interplay between light-engineered Higgs excitations and emergent vortex textures opens a pathway to probe nonequilibrium superconductivity with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Our results bridge quantum optics and condensed matter physics, offering new examples of quantum printing where one uses structured light to manipulate the collective modes in correlated quantum fluids.</p>

            <p>The optical properties of the superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ single crystals with a critical temperature $T_c\approx 26$ K have been measured in the {\it ab} plane in a wide frequency range using both infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry at temperatures of 4--300 K. The normal-state reflectance of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ is analyzed using a Drude-Lorentz model with one Drude component. The temperature dependences of the plasma frequency, optical conductivity, scattering rate, and dc resistivity of the Drude contribution in the normal state are presented. In the superconducting state, we observe a signature of the superconducting gap opening at $2\Delta $(5~K) = 11.8~meV. An abrupt decrease in the low-frequency dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon _1(\omega )$ at $T < T_c$ also evidences the formation of the superconducting condensate. The superconducting plasma frequency $\omega _{pl,s} = (213\pm 5)$~cm$^{-1}$ and the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda =(7.5\pm 0.2)$~$\mu $m at $T=5$~K are determined.</p>

            <h2>Ligand Engineering for Precise Control of Strongly-Confined CsPbI3 Nanoplatelet Superlattices for Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jongbeom Kim, Woo Hyeon Jeong, Junzhi Ye, Allison Nicole Arber, Vikram, Donghan Kim, Yi-Teng Huang, Yixin Wang, Dongeun Kim, Dongryeol Lee, Chia-Yu Chang, Xinyu Shen, Sung Yong Bae, Ashish Gaurav, Akshay Rao, Henry J. Snaith, M. Saiful Islam, Bo Ram Lee, Myoung Hoon Song, Robert L. Z. Hoye</p>
            <p>Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer promising opportunities for photonics and optoelectronics due to their narrowband emission, control over the transition dipole moment, and potential for polarized light emission. However, achieving uniform PeNPLs and effective surface passivation major challenges, especially for red-emitting iodide-based compounds. Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. Combining experimental and ab-initio modelling techniques, we demonstrate that ligands possessing an optimal backbone with strong surface binding and Pb-coordination not only passivate defects, but also improve thickness uniformity. The PeNPLs self-assemble into superlattices a single emission peak, indicative of uniform monolayer formation and orientation-dependent optical properties. Uniform-monolayer PeNPLs obtained with benzylphosphonic acid (BPAc) self-assemble into well-ordered superlattices with orientation-dependent optical properties. Face-down PeNPL thin films fabricated with solvent engineering exhibit Lambertian-like emission suitable for light-emitting devices, while edge-up oriented films exhibit linearly polarized emission. When integrated into light-emitting diodes, our PeNPL devices achieve a external quantum efficiency of 13.1%, the highest reported for strongly-confined PeNPL-based devices. Taken together, these results establish ancillary ligand-induced synthesis of uniform-monolayer PeNPLs as a decisive route to robust orientation control, positioning it as the central principle for advancing next-generation photonic and display technologies.</p>

            <h2>Perovskite Nanocrystals as Emerging Single-Photon Emitters: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jehyeok Ryu, Victor Krivenkov, Adam Olejniczak, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Yury Rakovich</p>
            <p>Metal-halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) have emerged as leading candidates for next-generation quantum emitters, offering a unique combination of high photoluminescence quantum yield, tunable emission, short radiative lifetimes, and record-high single-photon purity under ambient conditions. These properties, together with low-cost and scalable solution-phase fabrication, position PNCs as attractive alternatives to traditional epitaxial and colloidal quantum dots. In this Review, we outline the physical parameters that define quantum emission in PNCs, compare their performance to other established and emerging quantum emitters, and assess the key figures of merit, including photostability, single-photon purity, and photon indistinguishability, required for practical quantum applications. We discuss underlying mechanisms affecting PNC emission behavior and highlight recent advances in improving their quantum emitting properties through synthetic and photonic engineering approaches. While challenges related to environmental stability and photon indistinguishability remain, emerging strategies, such as surface passivation, metal ion doping, and coupling with electromagnetic nano- and micro-cavities, are steadily closing the gap between PNCs and ideal quantum light sources.</p>

            <h2>Collective Enhancement of Photon Blockade via Two-Photon Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lijuan Dong, Aanal Jayesh Shah, Peter Kirton, Hadiseh Alaeian, Simone Felicetti</p>
            <p>Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.</p>

            <h2>Vector magnetometry using cavity-enhanced microwave readout in nitrogen-vacancy diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reginald Wilcox, David Phillips, Matthew Steinecker, Erik Eisenach, Corey Hawkins, Linh Pham, Jennifer Schloss, Dirk Englund, Danielle Braje</p>
            <p>We demonstrate $4\pi$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.</p>

            <h2>A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit</h2>

            <p>Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</p>

            <h2>Interferometric Braiding of Anyons in Chern Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix A. Palm, Nader Mostaan, Nathan Goldman, Fabian Grusdt</p>
            <p>Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences using one and two impurities, the protocol gives independent access to the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, thereby providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</p>

            <h2>Resolving the phase of a Dirac topological state via interferometric photoemission</h2>

            <p>The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.</p>

            <h2>Nonequilibrium Probes of Quantum Geometry in Gapless Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bastien Lapierre, Per Moosavi, Blagoje Oblak</p>
            <p>Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.</p>

            <h2>Green Function Invariants for Floquet Topological Superconductivity Induced by Proximity Effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed Assili, Panagiotis Kotetes</p>
            <p>We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $\pi$ modes.</p>

            <h2>Electrostatic, Luminescent, and Paramagnetic Responses of Fresh BN Nanopowders Synthesized under Concentrated Light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lina Sartinska</p>
            <p>This study explores the properties of nanopowders synthesized under high-temperature, non-equilibrium conditions in a high-flux optical furnace in a nitrogen flow. Boron powders served as the starting material, and the intense thermal gradients during synthesis led to incomplete chemical reactions. As a result, the surface of the resulting nanoparticles is covered with a thin layer of sassolite, followed by boron oxides, beneath which lies a boron nitride shell. The subsurface contains boron-rich nitride phases, while the core consists of elemental boron. For reference, commercial platelet-like h-BN powders from the "Chempur" company were also analyzed. Initially, all synthesized nanopowders displayed pronounced electrostatic charging, photoluminescence (PL), and paramagnetic activity, attributable to high surface defect densities and unsaturated chemical bonds. However, after two years of exposure to ambient air, these nanopowders exhibited complete loss of electrostatic charging, absence of photoluminescence (PL), and disappearance of the characteristic single EPR resonance line. Similarly, commercial h-BN nanopowder from the "Chempur" company does not exhibit a single EPR resonance line too. FTIR analysis revealed progressive surface oxidation and hydroxylation of this powder, suggesting that atmospheric moisture and oxygen effectively passivated defect states. These findings underscore the critical role of surface chemistry in governing the electrostatic, optical, and magnetic behavior of BN-based nanomaterials and highlight the importance of defect stabilization for preserving functional properties over time.</p>

            <h2>Probing Topological Stability with Nonlocal Quantum Geometric Markers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quentin Marsal, Hui Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz, Annica M. Black-Schaffer</p>
            <p>Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Mediated interactions in mixtures of ultracold atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Henry Ando, Geyue Cai, Cheng Chin, Tilman Enss</p>
            <p>We describe recent theoretical and experimental developments on mediated interactions in mixtures of bosonic and fermionic atoms. We discuss how particle-hole excitations of a Fermi sea can induce long-range interactions between heavy impurities or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Conversely, phonon excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate induce interactions between fermionic atoms. These mediated interactions exhibit different short-range and long-range scaling regimes with distance and, if strong enough, can induce fermion superfluidity. We discuss the prospects for observing new phenomena that could arise from mediated interactions. Experimentally, we outline recent studies of the 133Cs-6Li Bose-Fermi mixture, a platform well-suited for investigating fermion-mediated interactions. A Cs Bose-Einstein condensate immersed in a degenerate Li Fermi gas is prepared with tunable interspecies interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, precision measurements of condensate properties reveal fermion-mediated attractions between bosons, matching theoretical predictions. In the strong-coupling regime, we observe suppression and revival of sound modes and novel many-body resonances. Altogether, we aim to highlight both instances where experiment and theory agree well, and promising prospects to engineer long-range interactions in atomic quantum gases.</p>

            <h2>Control of Extraordinary Optical Transmission in Resonant Terahertz Gratings via Lateral Depletion in an AlGaN-GaN Heterostructure</h2>

            <p>Periodic metallic gratings on substrates can support a range of electromagnetic modes, such as leaky waveguide, guided-resonant, and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity modes, which can strongly modulate optical transmission under resonant excitation. Here, we investigate how this coupling can be dynamically manipulated through charge-density control in a laterally patterned AlGaN/GaN heterostructure. The structure comprises metallic stripes separated by regions containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), forming a periodically modulated interface whose electromagnetic response is governed by the charge density between the stripes. In the unbiased state, the conductive 2DEG screens the incident terahertz field and suppresses excitation of guided modes. When the 2DEG is depleted, the change in boundary conditions allows efficient coupling into substrate resonances, producing a strong modulation at particular frequencies where extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) through the structure takes place. The results highlight the sensitive dependence of guided-mode-resonance (GMR) mediated EOT on inter-stripe charge distribution and demonstrate a direct interplay between carrier dynamics and resonant electromagnetic phenomena in the terahertz regime.</p>

Employing the magnetocaloric effect as a detection method, in conjunction with systematical field-dependent physical properties, we uncover a distinctive 1/2 magnetization plateau phase with significant quantum fluctuations. Our study unveils Nd3ScBi5 as a prototypical model with an emerging phase of enhanced quantum fluctuations triggered by first-order magnetic transitions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the single crystals of Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$, revealing that Ni intercalation profoundly alters the physical properties of NbSe$_2$. Magnetic measurements clearly show that the system is magnetically frustrated with antiferromagnetic ordering below 23.5\,K, with an irreversibility temperature near 10\,K, and a magnetic hysteresis with a small net magnetic moment. Overall, the system can be described as an inhomogeneous antiferromagnetic phase with magnetic disorder and magnetic frustration. We found two Curie-Weiss temperatures of -80\,K for the field in the {\it ab}-plane and -137\,K for the field out of plane, which are a consequence of anisotropic interactions in spin space and favor an orientation of the spin along the {\it c}-axis. Temperature-dependent resistivity shows a complete suppression of both charge density waves and superconducting order down to 300\,mK. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 84\,K reveals a $\overline{\Gamma}$-centered electron pocket in Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$, which is absent in pristine NbSe$_2$. The electronic structure results show a shift of the van Hove singularity (VHS), which is the main cause of the suppression of the electronic orders. These results align with recent theoretical predictions that Ni intercalation with cationic disorder favors frustrated antiferromagnetic stripe states, shifts the VHS and reconstructs the Fermi surface in NbSe$_2$. Our findings position Ni$_{0.19}$NbSe$_2$ within a magnetically frustrated, non-superconducting regime, highlighting how partial intercalation and disorder drive complex magnetic order and the Fermi surface reconstruction in low-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Measurement protocol for detecting correlated topological insulators in synthetic quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixin Ma, Chao Xu, Shenghan Jiang</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}\theta \hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $\theta$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao-Fan Wang, Han Ge, Jun-Yang Chen, Liusuo Wu, Xiaobin Chen, Jia-Wei Mei, Mingyuan Huang</p>
            <p>The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) unifies the Berry curvature (its imaginary part) and the quantum metric (its real part), yet Raman studies of chiral phonons have so far accessed only the former. We perform circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy on the quantum magnet K2Co(SeO3)2, where the field-odd chiral splitting and the field-even center-frequency shift collapse onto a single curve across temperature and magnetic field, revealing a common microscopic origin for both observables. Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement.</p>

            <h2>Microwave Dressed States and Vacuum Fluctuations in a Superconducting Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anoop Dhillon, A. Hamed Majedi</p>
            <p>Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.</p>

            <p>Crystalline symmetries determine the linear and nonlinear response of materials to external stimuli such as mechanical pressure and electromagnetic fields, governing phenomena such as piezoelectricity, optical activity, and multiple wave mixing with wide ranging technological applications. Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting.</p>

            <h2>Relaxation approach to quantum-mechanical modeling of ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phase transitions</h2>

            <p>Ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics are the electric counterparts of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These materials undergo temperature- and electric-field-induced phase transitions that give rise to their characteristic hysteresis loops. Modeling such hysteresis loops and associated phase transitions enables both a deeper fundamental understanding and reliable property predictions for this important class of materials. To date, modeling has largely relied on classical approaches, often remaining qualitative and/or empirical. Traditional interpretation of these transitions rests on two assumptions: (i) they are activated Arrhenius-type processes and (ii) they occur well within the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate that a model can instead be built on two ''orthogonal`` assumptions: (i) the phase transitions are relaxational processes and (ii) they require a quantum mechanical treatment. Applying this model to both antiferroelectrics and ferroelectrics overcomes the limitations of traditional models and enables efficient first-principles simulations of phase transitions. Furthermore, the success of our unconventional approach highlights the significance of quantum mechanics in transitions long regarded as purely classical. We anticipate that this framework will be applicable to a broad range of phase transitions, including magnetic, elastic, multiferroic, and electronic, along with modeling of quantum tunneling, rates of chemical reactions, and others.</p>

            <p>The tension between fermion pairing and magnetism affects numerous strongly correlated electron systems, from high-temperature cuprates to twisted bilayer graphene. Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.</p>

Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum this http URL mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.</p>

            <h2>A master equation approach to the n-coalescent problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bahram Houchmandzadeh (LIPhy)</p>
            <p>Given an evolutionary model, such as Wright--Fisher (WF) or Moran, the n-coalescent problem consists of going backward in time to find for example the time to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) and the topology of the tree. In the literature, this problem is tackled mostly by computing directly the random variable t, time to reach the MRCA. I show here that by shifting the focus from the random variable t to the joined variable (n,t), where n is the number of ancestors at time t, the problem is greatly simplified. Indeed, P(n,t), the probability of this variable, obeys a simpler master equation that can be solved in a straightforward way for the most general model. This probability can then be used to compute relevant information of the n-coalescent, for both random variables $t_{n}$ (random time to reach a given state n) and $n_{t}$ (random number of ancestors at a given time t). The cumulative distribution function for $t_{1}$ for example is $P(1,t)$. I give in this article the general solution for continuous time models such as Moran and discrete time ones such as WF.</p>

            <h2>Mutual information as a measure of renormalizability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brenden Bowen, Albert Farah, Spasen Chaykov, Nishant Agarwal</p>
            <p>Renormalization is an essential technique in field-theoretic descriptions of natural phenomena, where the absence of a UV-complete description yields an abundance of divergent quantities. While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability.</p>

            <h2>Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Peng</p>
            <p>We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.</p>

            <p>Monolayer 2D semiconductors, such as WS2, exhibit uniquely strong light-matter interactions due to exciton resonances that enable atomically-thin optical elements. Similar to geometry-dependent plasmon and Mie resonances, these intrinsic material resonances offer coherent and tunable light scattering. Thus far, the impact of the excitons temporal dynamics on the performance of such excitonic metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide valuable insights in the role of excitonic light scattering in 2D nanophotonic devices.</p>

            <p>Spectrally selective absorbers that maximize solar absorption and minimize thermal radiation loss are crucial for efficient solar thermal energy harvesting. However, limitations imposed by the intrinsic properties of conventional materials hinder the fabrication of interference-based absorbers with desired optical properties. Herein, a high-performance solar absorber with a Dallenbach-type dielectric-metal tandem structure was fabricated using an ultrathin, subquarter-wavelength thickness single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) membrane with tailored optical spectra as the absorbing layer. By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\approx 190^\circ$C ($270^\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber. This study presents a high-performance solar absorber with a simple planar structure and proposes a concept of designing dielectric with the desired optical properties by mixing various types of structure-sorted SWCNTs.</p>

            <p>Fast, volumetric imaging that integrates multiple imaging modalities is essential for probing dynamic, heterogeneous soft and biological matter. Here, we present the M3Scope, a simple yet versatile multiplane microscope that extends widefield detection with a modular multimode cube to enable dual color fluorescence, polarization-resolved, and correlative brightfield fluorescence imaging while (i) preserving simultaneous 3D acquisition at high frame rates (100 fps) and (ii) requiring minimal realignment. We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D. Taken together, these results show that the M3Scope delivers high speed volumetric imaging with flexible modality switching, providing a powerful platform for studying dynamic, heterogeneous systems across disciplines, from polymer physics to cell mechanobiology.</p>

Second, we provide a complete homotopy classification theorem for these maps, thereby clarifying their topological structure. Third, by means of the previous analysis, we connect the Fu-Kane-Mele index to the Chern number of one of the factors in the previously-mentioned decomposition, which in turn allows to exhibit how the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued topological obstruction to constructing a periodic and smooth Bloch frame for the projection-valued map, measured by the Fu-Kane-Mele index, can be concentrated in a single pseudo-periodic Kramers pair.</p>

This release introduces significant expansions and enhancements that enable the definition of a phase-field model directly from the free-energy functional via compile-time evaluated functional differentiation. It also introduces directional derivatives, symbolic summation, tensor-valued expressions, and compile-time derived finite difference stencils of arbitrary order and accuracy. Furthermore, the code has been parallelized for CPUs with MPI, and GPU computing has been added using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). For the latter, symbolic expressions are compiled into optimized CUDA kernels, allowing large-scale simulations to execute entirely on the GPU. For large systems ($32,768^2$ in 2D and $1,024^3$ in 3D with double precision), speedups up to $\sim \!\!1,000 \times$ were obtained compared to the first version of SymPhas using multi-threaded CPU execution on a single system.

            <p>Ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy provides unique access to the structural dynamics of molecules, spin-valley relaxation in semiconductors, and the non-equilibrium optical response of chiral nanophotonic systems. Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (<50 ${\mu}$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation. The simplicity, sensitivity, and wide applicability of this detection scheme provide a powerful platform for broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy, opening new opportunities in biochemistry, solid-state physics, and nanophotonics.</p>

            <p>Soft electronics have recently gathered considerable interest thanks to their bio-mechanical compatibility. An important feature of such deformable conductors is their electrical response to strain. While development of stretchable materials with high gauge factors has attracted considerable attention, there is a growing need for stretchable conductors whose response to deformation can be accurately engineered to provide arbitrary resistance-strain relationships. The rare studies addressing this issue have focused on deterministic geometries of single rigid materials, limiting the scope of such strategies. Herein, we introduce the novel concept of periodic stretchable patterns combining multiple conductive materials to produce tailored responses. Using shortest-path algorithms, we establish a computationally efficient selection method to obtain required resistance-strain relationship. Using this algorithm, we identify and experimentally demonstrate constant resistance-strain responses up to 50% elongation using a single micro-textured material. Finally, we demonstrate counter-intuitive sinusoidal responses by integrating three materials, with interesting applications in sensing and soft robotics.</p>

The missing first Shapiro step coincides with a sharp voltage jump during superconducting switching, yet reappears when the jump is lowered and softened by increasing microwave power, temperature, or magnetic field. It also reappears at higher microwave frequencies, consistent with qualitative results from an RSJ model incorporating the sharp jump. These observations indicate that the absence of the first Shapiro step, associated with the sharp switching jump, simply results from their location within the measurement blind region.

            <p>Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</p>

            <p>Identifying the universality class of critical active phase transitions has been the subject of recent interest and controversy. Resolving these controversies will require robust numerical investigations to determine whether active critical exponents point to novel universality classes or are consistent with established ones. Here, we conduct large-scale computer simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of the motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) of active Brownian hard spheres in three dimensions (3D), finding that the static and dynamic critical exponents all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which flows to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and likely the entire phase diagram of active Brownian hard spheres is similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Wang, Xiaodong He, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>We study many-body quantum geometric effects in time-dependent system with emergent quantum integrable field theory instantaneously. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the system can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two particles from the initial quantum integrable system. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze an Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined,where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhibits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. As the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Emergent fractals in dirty topological crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel J. Salib, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Non-trivial geometry of electronic Bloch states gives rise to topological insulators which are robust against sufficiently weak randomness inevitably present in any quantum material. However, increasing disorder triggers a quantum phase transition into a featureless normal insulator. As the underlying quantum critical point is approached from the topological side, small scattered droplets of normal insulators start to develop in the system and their coherent nucleation causes ultimate condensation into a trivial insulator. Unless disorder is too strong, the normal insulator accommodates disjoint tiny topological puddles. Furthermore, in the close vicinity of such a transition the emergent islands of topological and trivial insulators display spatial fractal structures, a feature that is revealed only by local topological markers. Here we showcase this (possibly) generic phenomenon that should be apposite to dirty topological crystals of any symmetry class in any dimension from the Bott index and local Chern marker for a square-lattice-based disordered Chern insulator model.</p>

            <h2>Engineering stacking-induced topological phase transitions in bilayer heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arjyama Bordoloi, Daniel Kaplan, Sobhit Singh</p>
            <p>Nonmagnetic topological insulators (TIs) are known for their robust metallic surface/edge states that are protected by time-reversal symmetry, making them promising candidates for next-generation spintronic and nanoelectronic devices. Traditional approaches to realizing TIs have focused on inducing band inversion via strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yet many materials with substantial SOC often remain topologically trivial. In this work, we present a materials-design strategy for engineering topologically non-trivial phases, e.g., quantum spin Hall phases, by vertically stacking topologically trivial Rashba monolayers in an inverted fashion. Using BiSb as a prototype system, we demonstrate that while the BiSb monolayer is topologically trivial (despite having significant SOC), an inverted BiSb-SbBi bilayer configuration realizes a non-trivial topological phase with enhanced spin Hall conductivity. We further reveal a delicate interplay between the SOC strength and the interlayer electron tunneling that governs the emergence of a nontrivial topological phase in the bilayer heterostructure. This phase can be systematically tuned using an external electric field, providing an experimentally accessible means of controlling the system's topology. Our magnetotransport studies further validate this interplay, by revealing $g$-factor suppression and the emergence a zeroth Landau level. Notably, the inverted bilayer heterostructure exhibits a robust and tunable spin Hall effect, with performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art materials. Thus, our findings unveil an alternative pathway for designing and engineering functional properties in 2D topological systems using topologically trivial constituent monolayers.</p>

            <h2>Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Rausch, C. Karrasch</p>
            <p>Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results are consistent with an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.</p>

            <p>Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image and manifests itself in diverse functionalities across all scales of matter - from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields in it remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover a universal mechanism of spin-selective chiral photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. This mechanism embodies a chiral molecular compass - a photoinduced magnetization vector that orients the photoelectron spin. It arises in photoexcited chiral molecules even under isotropic illumination, operates even in isotropic chiral media, and enables a phenomenon central to CISS: locking of the photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. It shows that chiral molecules can sustain time-odd correlations whereas achiral molecules cannot. Our findings have broad implications, from unambiguously identifying the origin of CISS effect in photoionization to harvesting correlations underlying this effect in other forms of CISS in various chiral materials.</p>

            <p>Controlling electron's spin and orbital degrees of freedom has been a major research focus over the past two decades, as it underpins the electrical manipulation of magnetization. Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the intrinsic edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case probably mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for current induced torques.</p>

            <h2>Energy Underprediction from Symmetry in Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials</h2>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating materials simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. However, despite significant advances, we identify a critical yet overlooked issue undermining their reliability: a systematic energy underprediction. This problem becomes starkly evident in large-scale thermodynamic stability assessments. By performing over 12 million calculations using nine MLIAPs for over 150,000 inorganic crystals in the Materials Project, we demonstrate that most frontier models consistently underpredict energy above hull (Ehull), a key metric for thermodynamic stability, total energy, and formation energy, despite the fact that over 90\% of test structures (DFT-relaxed) are in the training data. The mean absolute errors (MAE) for Ehull exceed ~30 meV/atom even by the best model, directly challenging claims of achieving ``DFT accuracy'' for property predictions central to materials discovery, especially related to (meta-)stability. Crucially, we trace this underprediction to insufficient handling of symmetry degrees of freedom (DOF), constituting both lattice symmetry and Wyckoff site symmetries for the space group. MLIAPs exhibit pronounced errors (MAE for Ehull $>$ ~40 meV/atom) in structures with high symmetry DOF, where subtle atomic displacements significantly impact energy landscapes. Further analysis also indicates that the MLIAPs show severe energy underprediction for a large proportion of near-hull materials. We argue for improvements on symmetry-aware models such as explicit DOF encoding or symmetry-regularized loss functions, and more robust MLIAPs for predicting crystal properties where the preservation and breaking of symmetry are pivotal.</p>

            <p>We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases. Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Gallavotti, A. Zaccone</p>
            <p>We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</p>

Intermediate fields ($|\bm{B}| \lesssim 20$ mT) linearize the motion along the axis perpendicular to $\bm{B}$. At high magnetic fields, we observe the surprising emergence of a second, distinct linearization along the axis parallel to $\bm{B}$.

Terahertz third-harmonic generation is observed at room temperature under the drive of a multicycle narrowband terahertz pulse with a peak field strength of down to tens of kV/cm. The observed terahertz third-harmonic generation exhibits a perturbative cubic power-law dependence on the terahertz drive. By varying the polarization of the drive pulse from linear to elliptical, we realize a sensitive tuning of the third harmonic yield. By carrying out theoretical analysis based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we can properly describe the experimental results and ascribe the observed THz nonlinearity to field-driven kinetics of the Weyl fermions.</p>

The exponents agree with those obtained in previous studies on related mean-field models. Moreover, it predicts a non-trivial spatial profile of the glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$ within the cavity which exhibits a scaling feature approaching the dynamical glass transition.</p>

            <p>Moiré superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moiré bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moiré bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31°. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moiré bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moiré bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moiré bulk systems.</p>

            <p>When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder; and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current that remains coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for tunable chiral channels in next generation quantum optical solid-state devices.</p>

            <p>We propose and theoretically study minimal models of Néel ordered collinear antiferromagnets exhibiting the anomalous Hall effect. For simplicity, we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. We provide explicit examples of a Néel ordered ferrimagnet and a Dzyaloshinskii weak ferromagnet. We analyze Dzyaloshinskii's invariants for the existence of spontaneous magnetization in these Néel ordered systems. As a result, we find that the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for specific directions of the Néel order, dictated by the crystal lattice symmetries. Microscopic calculations of the Berry curvature for the studied systems confirm the validity of these Dzyaloshinskii's invariants. We show that the anomalous Hall effect mechanism in these antiferromagnets arises from the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the Néel order and the spin-orbit coupling, both originating from the broken symmetries that permit the Dzyaloshinskii's invariant in the system.</p>

            <h2>Force-induced Elastic Softening and Conformational Transitions in a Polyampholyte Chain</h2>

            <p>The mechanical response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and polyampholyte (PA) chains is vital for understanding their biological functions and designing functional materials. We investigate the force-extension behavior of a PA chain with distinct charge sequences using molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on the generalized random-phase approximation (GRPA). A diblock PA chain under extensional force undergoes a continuous coil-to-stretch transition at weak electrostatic coupling, which sharpens into a globule-coil-like transition at stronger coupling. The GRPA theory quantitatively captures these behaviors, including the sharp conformational transition and its dependence on electrostatic strength. Simulations reveal pronounced hysteresis during the force-extension and relaxation processes. Additionally, the elastic modulus exhibits four regimes: an initial plateau, stress stiffening, an exponential stress-softening behavior, and a stress stiffening regime. Using the theoretical model and structural input of the PA chain, we have demonstrated that the elastic modulus in the elastic softening regime decreases exponentially, $E\sim \exp(-\alpha_0 f/\Gamma_e)$, as a function of $f$, which aligns with the simulation results. The elastic response of the PA chain is further examined across different charge sequences, where both elastic softening and sharp transitions are absent at smaller block lengths. Finally, coarse-grained models of IDPs such as LAF-1 and DDX4 exhibit similar nonlinear elasticity, highlighting the universality of these mechanisms. Our results establish a fundamental link between electrostatic correlations, charge sequence, and nonlinear elasticity, bridging molecular interactions and macroscopic mechanics.</p>

For two embedded models that introduce auxiliary variables, numerical simulations of Schrödinger evolution revealed that fairness varies significantly depending on the embedding, and the chain strength is related to ground-state fairness. Using perturbation theory, we found that chain strength determines the energy landscape around ground states, with flatter landscapes having higher probabilities of being obtained.</p>

            <p>Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator. Generally, the dimension of the density operator grows exponentially ($\sim \! 2^N$) with the number of emitters, in the absence of any symmetries such as in Dicke superradiance with full or partial permutational symmetry. We present a detailed study of the superradiant peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, for one-, two- and three-dimensional arrays in free-space and emitter chains coupled to waveguide reservoirs. For few emitters ($N\lesssim 14$) we utilize the full quantum master equation, and for mesoscopic emitter numbers ($N\lesssim 400$) we use a second- and third-order cumulant expansion of the operator averages to track the time evolution of the system.</p>

            <p>In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum-limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. If not taken into account, the error on the signal strength can be as large as a factor of about 2, which is unacceptable for quantitative experiments. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +- 20 % limited by sources of noise internal to the optomechanical element.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Scandi, Álvaro M. Alhambra</p>
            <p>Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point up to a small renormalization of the system Hamiltonian, but it also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit of a coarse-graining time much larger than the inverse of the smallest frequency difference. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.</p>

For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</p>

            <h2>High-quality nanostructured diamond membranes for nanoscale quantum sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Pakpour Tabrizi, Artur Lozovoi, Sean Karg, Tecla Bottinelli Mondandon, Melody Leung, Kai-Hung Cheng, Nathalie P. de Leon</p>
            <p>Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.</p>

            <h2>Probing short-range gravity using quantum reflection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Boynewicz, C. A. Sackett</p>
            <p>Quantum reflection occurs when ultra-cold atoms are incident on a material surface with sufficiently low velocity. The reflecting matter wave can interfere with the incident wave to form a detectable pattern, and this pattern contains information about atom-surface interactions at micrometer scales. We discuss how such an interferometer could be used to probe for anomalous short-range forces that are predicted by some beyond-standard model theories. We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced spectral range of strain-induced tuning of quantum dots in circular Bragg grating cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Gamov, Matthias Sauter, Samuel Huber, Quirin Buchinger, Peter Gschwandtner, Ulrike Wallrabe, Sven Höfling, Tobias Huber-Loyola</p>
            <p>Tunable sources of entangled and single photons are essential for implementing entanglement-based quantum information protocols, as quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping depend on photon indistinguishability. Tunable devices are fabricated from indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) embedded in gallium arsenide (GaAs) nanomembranes placed on monolithic piezoelectric substrates. Circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators enhance emission brightness and exploit the Purcell effect; however, the inclusion of CBGs reduces strain-mediated tunability compared to planar nanomembranes. A simple and effective solution is introduced: filling the CBG trenches with a stiff dielectric (aluminum oxide) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) restores up to 95% of the tunability of planar structures. Finite element analysis (FEA) confirms that the tunability loss originates from bending in the device layers due to strain relief in the CBG geometry. Lowering the stiffness of intermediate layers between the QDs and the piezoelectric actuator, such as in bonding or reflector layers, further increases strain losses in uncoated CBGs. Coated devices maintain 98-99% strain-tuning efficiency across all simulated underlayer stiffnesses. The results demonstrate that advantageous optical cavity properties can be effectively combined with piezoelectric strain tuning, enabling scalable, bright, and tunable quantum light sources.</p>

            <h2>First-principles evidence for conventional superconductivity in a quasicrystal approximant</h2>

            <p>Quasicrystals (QCs) host long-range order without translational symmetry, a regime in which the very foundations of BCS theory are not straightforwardly applicable, yet experiments on QCs and their approximant crystals (ACs) point to conventional, $s$-wave, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity. With this work we directly address this seeming contradiction from first principles. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute the superconducting properties of the recently discovered AC Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and quantitatively reproduce its bulk $T_\text{c}$. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first \emph{ab initio} determination of $T_\text{c}$ for an AC and establishes that the electron-phonon framework is predictive in these systems as well. Using the generalized quasichemical approximation for alloy modeling in the decagonal Al-Os family, we predict tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$; in particular, Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ is dynamically stable and estimated to have a $T_\text{c}$ about 30% above Al$_{13}$Os$_4$. Finally, we argue that $T_\text{c}$ obtained for ACs provides practical bounds for the $T_\text{c}$ of their parent QCs, suggesting that the quasicrystalline counterparts of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ could harbor the highest $T_\text{c}$ among QCs yet.</p>

            <h2>The parent state in kagome metals and superconductors: Chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state</h2>

            <p>The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.</p>

            <p>Exciton condensation--an interaction-driven, macroscopically coherent paired-fermion state--offers the prospect for dissipationless energy transport in solids, akin to that in superconductivity. Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples. Our work establishes a room-temperature excitonic platform for exploring strongly correlated many-body physics and advancing near-dissipationless, coherent quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Yarmohammadi, Libor Šmejkal, James K. Freericks</p>
            <p>Altermagnets feature antiparallel spin sublattices with $d$-, $g$-, or $i$-wave spin order, yielding nonrelativistic spin splitting without net magnetization. We show that embedding a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet in a driven optical cavity induces a finite, tunable magnetization. Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization. This work demonstrates cavity control of altermagnets for spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Uncovering field-induced magnetic phase transition by direct observation of the crystal electric-field splitting in a rare-earth magnetic insulator</h2>

            <p>An indispensable step toward understanding magnetic interactions in rare-earth magnets is to determine the spatially anisotropic single-ion properties set by crystal electric field (CEF) physics. The CEF Hamiltonian yields a discrete energy spectrum governed by a set of parameters reflecting the local site symmetry of the magnetic ion. However, experimentally determining these parameters, especially for ones at low-symmetry sites remains highly challenging. In this work, we directly measure the CEF level splittings of CsErSe2 under magnetic fields using optical spectroscopy. This enables us to determine the CEF parameters and to predict the metamagnetic-like transition arising from a level-crossing in the ground state. We also identify a level-crossing in the first excited state that leads to a non-monotonic Zeeman splitting, which strongly influences the temperature and field dependence of the magnetization. Our results highlight the capacity of single-ion physics to drive rich and unanticipated phenomena in rare-earth magnetic insulators under applied magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-Dominated Thermal Transport and Large Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in Topological Semimetal CoSi</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luyao Zhong, Xin Jin, Mingquan He, Rui Wang, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Tianqi Deng, Xiaolong Yang</p>
            <p>The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, relating the electronic thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm e}$) to the electrical conductivity, is vital in numerous applications such as in the design of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). While the WF law is generally robust, violations are frequently observed, typically manifesting in a reduced Lorenz number ($L$) relative to the Sommerfeld value ($L_0$) due to inelastic scattering. Here, we report a pronounced departure from the WF law in the topological semimetal CoSi, where the electronic Lorenz number ($L_{\rm e}$) instead rises up to $\sim40\%$ above $L_0$. We demonstrate that this anomaly arises from strong bipolar diffusive transport, enabled by topological band-induced electron-hole compensation, which allows electrons and holes to flow cooperatively and additively enhance the heat current. Concurrently, we unveil that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity is anomalously large and becomes the dominant component below room temperature. As a result, if $\kappa_{\rm L}$ is assumed negligible -- as conventional in metals, the resulting $L$ from the total thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm tot}=\kappa_{\rm L}+\kappa_{\rm e}$) deviates from $L_0$ by more than a factor of three. Our work provides deeper insight into the unconventional thermal transport physics in topological semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Correlated quantum machines beyond the standard second law</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Milton Aguilar, Eric Lutz</p>
            <p>The laws of thermodynamics strongly restrict the performance of thermal machines. Standard thermodynamics, initially developed for uncorrelated macroscopic systems, does not hold for microscopic systems correlated with their environments. We here derive an exact formula for the efficiency of any cyclically driven quantum engine by using generalized laws of quantum thermodynamics that account for all possible correlations between all involved parties, including initial correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of two basic modes of engine operation: the usual thermal case, where heat is converted into work, and a novel athermal regime, where work is extracted from entropic resources, such as system-bath correlations. In the latter regime, the efficiency is not bounded by the usual Carnot formula. Our results provide a unified formalism to determine the efficiency of correlated microscopic quantum machines.</p>

            <h2>Parametric Instabilities of Correlated Quantum Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gal Shavit, Gil Refael</p>
            <p>Strongly correlated quantum materials exhibit a rich landscape of ordered phases with highly tunable properties, making them an intriguing platform for exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science. Our work provides the toolbox for controlling these excitations.</p>

            <h2>High-speed antiferromagnetic domain walls driven by coherent spin waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kyle L. Seyler, Hantao Zhang, Daniel Van Beveren, Costel R. Rotundu, Young S. Lee, Ran Cheng, David Hsieh</p>
            <p>The ability to rapidly manipulate domain walls (DWs) in magnetic materials is key to developing novel high-speed spintronic memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics.</p>

            <p>Controlling nanoscale interactions to suppress aggregation from short-range attractive forces is a key problem in nanoengineering.

By semi-classical quantum electrodynamics, we study ground state dispersion forces for cylindrical dielectric nanorods made of polystyrene (PS), and zinc oxide (ZnO) embedded in toluene-based host media with gold-coated magnetite nanoparticles and also predict magnetic contributions to the non-retarded excited state interaction. The variation in magnetic permeability enables tuning between repulsive and attractive interaction and a thermally unstable and measurable magnetic Casimir traps are predicted between a pair of ZnO-PS nanoparticles whose equilibrium position can be modulated over an order of magnitude with a small variation in the size of the magnetite nanoparticle. This provides an alternative magnetic Casimir-effect pathway to reversibly tune quantum electromagnetic forces at the nanoscale for assembly and enhancement of colloidal stability.</p>

            <h2>Angular Patterns of Photoluminescence in Quantum Dot Spherical Superparticles Mediated by Whispering-Gallery Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu. E. Geints</p>
            <p>Quantum dot superparticles are a specific class of metamaterials created through the self-assembly of nanometer semiconductor quantum dots into organized micro-scale structures, such as microspheres. Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle.</p>

            <p>By applying the conventional two-liquid model to the magnetoresistivity tensor, we reveal a record-high carrier mobility for surface states in tetradymite topological insulators ($\sim$ 20000 cm$^2$/Vs) in both bulk crystals and thin flakes of Sn-Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S. Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neetesh Dhakar, Sunil Kumar</p>
            <p>Following the ultrafast photoexcitation of a semiconductor, it embodies competing dynamics among photocarriers, many-body transient states of highly energetic excitons, and electron-hole liquid. Here, we show that femtosecond optical pulse excitation induces transient excitonic shift current contributing to stronger THz emission from a single crystalline bulk MoS2 at low temperatures. The control of dominating excitonic shift current is elucidated from excitation density dependent experiments at varying temperatures. A strong decrease in the excitonic contribution beyond a critical fluence of 150microJ/cm^2 is observed at a very low temperature of 20K. This behavior suggests the formation of a new quantum condensate, i.e., the electron-hole liquid, in the regime when the exciton density is overwhelmingly large that the average spacing between exciton pairs is comparable to the exciton radius. Furthermore, the exciton density dependent THz emission at varying temperatures is consistent with the Varshni model and the crystal Debye temperature of 260K.</p>

            <p>Josephson junctions are essential devices in superconducting electronics and quantum computing hardware. Here we predict electrical control of the supercurrent in composite superconductor-insulator-ferroelectric-insulator-superconductor (S-I-FE-I-S) Josephson junctions. Inversion symmetry broken by unequal dielectric barrier thicknesses and/or potentials converts ferroelectric polarization reversal into a substantial change of the critical current. With a WKB tunneling model we obtain non-volatile switching of the critical current with on-off efficiency up to 0.9 for physically realistic parameters. This can be achieved by optimizing the thicknesses and potential barriers of the insulating layers, as well as the thickness and dielectric constant of the ferroelectric layer. We also derive a compact linear expression for the critical current valid for small polarizations. Our results identify ferroelectric Josephson junctions as electrically programmable superconducting current switches for cryogenic memory and logic applications.</p>

Recent theoretical developments have established fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations that constrain the fluctuations in Szilard's engine. These relations rely on auxiliary experimental protocols known as backward experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the thermodynamics of Szilard's engine by implementing two distinct types of backward experiments. We verify and compare the corresponding fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations associated with each protocol. Our results reveal that the entropy production inferable from measurement may serve as a more relevant quantifier of information than the widely used mutual information.</p>

            <p>We investigate the phase diagram of a relativistic, parametrically driven O($N$)-symmetric theory coupled to a Markovian thermal bath. Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaoru Ohno, Yutaka Okabe</p>
            <p>In a recent paper [JHEP 11 (2020) 118], S. Giombi and H. Khanchandani studied the 1/N expansion of the O(N) model in semi-infinite space within the framework of conformal field theory in anti-de Sitter space. They presented a series expansion for the O(1/N) correction to the boundary anomalous dimension in the case of the ordinary transition. Although they were unable to sum the series or simplify its form analytically, they demonstrated numerically that their result matches our earlier, simple analytic expression given in Prog. Theor. Phys. 70 (1983) 1226. In this paper, we show that their series expansion is in fact exactly equivalent to our original expression. However, since the final formula in eq. (4.57) of their paper, which is expressed in terms of two different 3F2 functions, cannot produce the correct values, we derive the correct formulae involving two 3F2 functions in the Appendices. We comment on the similarity and difference between their analysis and ours in the cases of the ordinary and special transitions, and present full details of deriving the anomalous dimension for all the cases including the extraordinary transition, which were not written in our earlier paper.</p>

            <h2>Analytically Optimising Muon Diffusion Experiments with Fisher information</h2>

            <p>One of the key challenges in performing muon experiments is knowing which temperatures and applied fields to measure at, and how many muon decays should be measured at each temperature/field combination to get the most useful dataset. We have developed a technique using Fisher information which, for a given muon asymmetry function, can analytically calculate the number of muon decays required to obtain a given error on the parameters of the asymmetry model. Here, we report on the results of our project, in particular applying our methodology to the problem of knowing the best choice of applied longitudinal fields for ionic diffusion experiments.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Decoherence Dynamics in Doubly Disordered Spin Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cooper M. Selco, Christian Bengs, Chaitali Shah, Zhuorui Zhang, Ashok Ajoy</p>
            <p>Elucidating the emergence of irreversible macroscopic laws from reversible quantum many-body dynamics is a question of broad importance across all quantum science. Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes. These findings establish a microscopic framework for manipulating decoherence pathways and suggests engineered disorder as a new design principle for realizing long-lived quantum memories and sensors.</p>

            <h2>Deep generative priors for robust and efficient electron ptychography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur R. C. McCray, Stephanie M. Ribet, Georgios Varnavides, Colin Ophus</p>
            <p>Electron ptychography enables dose-efficient atomic-resolution imaging, but conventional reconstruction algorithms suffer from noise sensitivity, slow convergence, and extensive manual hyperparameter tuning for regularization, especially in three-dimensional multislice reconstructions. We introduce a deep generative prior (DGP) framework for electron ptychography that uses the implicit regularization of convolutional neural networks to address these challenges. Two DGPs parameterize the complex-valued sample and probe within an automatic-differentiation mixed-state multislice forward model. Compared to pixel-based reconstructions, DGPs offer four key advantages: (i) greater noise robustness and improved information limits at low dose; (ii) markedly faster convergence, especially at low spatial frequencies; (iii) improved depth regularization; and (iv) minimal user-specified regularization. The DGP framework promotes spatial coherence and suppresses high-frequency noise without extensive tuning, and a pre-training strategy stabilizes reconstructions. Our results establish DGP-enabled ptychography as a robust approach that reduces expertise barriers and computational cost, delivering robust, high-resolution imaging across diverse materials and biological systems.</p>

            <p>Optomechanical sensors enable exquisitely sensitive force measurements, with emerging applications across quantum technologies, standards, fundamental science, and engineering. Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration.</p>

            <h2>Mixed-state phase structure of gauge-Higgs subsystem codes under logical-preserving decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Some of lattice-gauge-theory models, in particular gauge-Higgs model (GHM), can be regarded and work as a subsystem code. This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits.</p>

            <h2>Soap Film Drainage Under Tunable Gravity Using a Centrifugal Thin Film Balance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Monier, Kévin Gutierrez, Cyrille Claudet, Franck Celestini, Christophe Brouzet, Christophe Raufaste</p>
            <p>Surface bubbles are an abundant source of aerosols, with important implications for climate processes. In this context, we investigate the stability and thinning dynamics of soap films under effective gravity fields. Experiments are performed using a centrifugal thin-film balance capable of generating accelerations from 0.2 up to 100 times standard gravity, combined with thin-film interferometry to obtain time-resolved thickness maps. Across all experimental conditions, the drainage dynamics are shown to be governed by capillary suction and marginal regeneration-a mechanism in which thick regions of the film are continuously replaced by thin film elements (TFEs) formed at the meniscus. We consistently recover a thickness ratio of 0.8 - 0.9 between the TFEs and the adjacent film, in agreement with previous observations under standard gravity. The measured thinning rates also follow the predicted scaling laws. We identified that gravity has three distinct effects: (i) it induces a strong stretching of the initial film, extending well beyond the linear-elastic regime; (ii) it controls the meniscus size, and thereby the amplitude of the capillary suction and the drainage rate; and (iii) it reveals an inertia-to-viscous transition in the motion of TFEs within the film. These results are supported by theoretical modeling and highlight the robustness of marginal regeneration and capillary-driven drainage under extreme gravity conditions.</p>

            <p>We develop a semiclassical framework to determine scaling dimensions of neutral composite operators in scalar conformal field theories. For the critical Ising $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$, we obtain the full spectrum of composite operators built out of $n$ fields transforming in the traceless-symmetric Lorentz representations to next-to-leading order in the double-scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with $\lambda n$ fixed. At any given order the semiclassical expansion resums an infinite number of Feynman diagrams. Combining our results with existing perturbative computations further yields the complete five-loop scaling dimensions in the $\epsilon$-expansion for the family of $\phi^n$ operators. Finally, in three dimensions the next-to-leading order semiclassical results supersede any other existing methodology for $n \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10)$.</p>

            <p>We present a multiscale microstructural analysis of olivine from the non-poikilitic lithology of the poikilitic shergottite NWA 7721, using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and context in situ 2D micro-XRD. A single olivine crystal contains two distinct subgrain populations. Type 1 subgrains are fine (1-5 micrometers), randomly oriented, and nearly strain-free, whereas Type 2 subgrains are coarse (greater than 30 micrometers), aligned, and strongly strained. Layered DFXM data reveal slip-band features in Type 2 that are absent in Type 1. We interpret Type 1 as products of shock-induced recrystallization, whereas Type 2 preserves remnants of a highly deformed parent grain. This bimodal microstructure, not observed in other Martian meteorites including the paired NWA 1950 and ALH A77005, points to a heterogeneous response to impact influenced by pre-existing strain in the olivine grain. We propose that NWA 7721 olivine experienced substantial crustal or magmatic stress before impact. The subsequent shock wave imposed a rapid load-release cycle that mobilized dislocations and produced low-angle boundaries in Type 2, while driving recrystallization of Type 1. Grain-growth constraints limit the post-shock heating duration to approximately 2.3 s, consistent with rapid quenching. These results provide the first evidence that non-poikilitic olivine in NWA 7721 preserves dynamic crustal deformation on Mars in the Late Amazonian.</p>

            <p>We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.</p>

            <p>We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</p>

This naturally leads to a faithful functor between the categories for each system and the category of the stacked system. We construct an intermediate `product' category which we then show is equivalent to the stacked system category. As a consequence, the sectors associated with an invertible state are trivial, namely, invertible states support no anyonic quasi-particles.</p>

            <p>A shortcut-to-adiabaticity is compared with a numerically optimized protocol for implementing a high-fidelity quantum gate on Rydberg atoms. The counterdiabatic method offers an analytical framework for accelerating high-fidelity gates by mimicking the time evolution of a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian using fast-oscillating fields. This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms. It stresses the important role played by constraints on the optimized pulses in time and in amplitude that are crucial in determining the quality of the optimization method.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumik Ghosh, Arjun Mirani, Yihui Quek, Michelle Xu</p>
            <p>We study a counterintuitive property of 'conditioning' on the result of measuring a subsystem of a quantum state: such conditioning can boost design quality, at the cost of increased system size. We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.</p>

            <p>We develop a bootstrap approach to Euclidean two-point correlators, in the thermal or ground state of quantum mechanical systems. We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become "inequalities of motion" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.</p>

            <p>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials that exhibit a diverse range of electronic structures, including charge density waves (CDWs) that can lead to insulating, semiconducting, metallic, and even superconducting phases. While the formation of CDWs in these systems has been recognized in early research [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 156401 (2022); Nat. Phys. 11, 328 (2015)], the underlying mechanisms driving the commensurate CDW (CCDW) phase remain largely unexplored. CCDWs typically originate from factors such as perfect Fermi surface nesting and/or electron-phonon coupling, causing the divergence of the chiral electronic structure. However, in the case of layered 2D TMD materials with CCDW phases, the significance of reconstructed electronic structures resulting from periodic lattice distortions (PLD) and photoemission matrix element effects in the CCDW instability needs to be visualized. This study focuses on computationally accessible CCDW phases in 1T-Ta$S_2$, a prototypical TMD with a rich CDW phase diagram, aiming to understand the origins of CCDW phases. The insights gained from this investigation have the potential to advance the application of 2D materials in next-generation electronics, quantum sensing and information science.</p>

            <p>Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</p>

            <p>Deterministic optimization algorithms unequivocally partition a complex energy landscape in inherent structures (ISs) and their respective basins of attraction. Can these basins be defined solely through geometric principles? This question is paramount to understanding hard sphere jamming, a key model of disordered matter. We here address the issue by proposing a geometric class of gradient descent-like algorithms, which we use to study a system in the hard-sphere universality class, the random Lorentz gas. The statistics of the resulting ISs is found to be strictly inherited from those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The landscape roughness is further found to give rise to a hierarchical organization of ISs, which various algorithms explore differently. In particular, greedy and reluctant schemes tend to favor ISs of markedly different densities. The resulting ISs nevertheless robustly exhibit a universal force distribution, thus confirming the geometric nature of the jamming universality class. Along the way, the physical origin of a dynamical Gardner transition is identified.</p>

High-field magnetization measurements reveal a first-order-like spin-reorientation transition at 25.6 T. Our INS-based magnetic model finds that this is caused by an avoided crossing of an excited-state singlet with the ground-state doublet. Surprisingly, our model predicts that quantum critical and tricritical points are accessible within the range of experimentally determined model parameters and may be reached by varying the direction of an applied magnetic field.</p>

Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.</p>

            <h2>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath, Simon B. Jäger</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <h2>A control variate method for threshold crossing probabilities of plastic deformation driven by transient coloured noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harry L.F. Ip, Charlie Mathey, Laurent Mertz, Jonathan J. Wylie</p>
            <p>We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. Our approach uses a coupling between the white-noise-driven process and the coloured-noise-driven process, yielding a variance-reduced estimator through control variate techniques. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.</p>

            <p>We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method to quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological information of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament fabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles embedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through an aluminum nozzle in a custom setup comparable to commercial printers. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations from classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and non-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine the local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced non-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions, reflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. We complement the experiments with computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow inside the printing nozzle, incorporating filament melting through an enthalpy-porosity formulation and treating the air-polymer melt interface using a two-phase approach. The simulated velocity profiles agree closely with the XPTV measurements across the investigated operating conditions, supporting the experimental interpretation. Our findings demonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and rheological properties, underscoring its potential as a tool for investigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial processing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this is the first application of XPTV to polymer melt rheology. It enables measurements that are inaccessible to conventional optical methods.</p>

            <p>High-quality two-dimensional (2D) dielectrics are crucial for fabricating 2D/3D hybrid vertical electronic devices such as metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) based Schottky diodes and hot electron transistors, the production of which is constrained by the scarcity of bulk layered wide bandgap semiconductors. In this research, we present the synthesis of a new 2D dielectric, monolayer InO2, which differs in stoichiometry from its bulk form, over a large area (>300 um2) by intercalating at the epitaxial graphene (EG)/SiC interface. By adjusting the lateral size of graphene through optical lithography prior to the intercalation, we tune the thickness of InO2 where predominantly (~85%) monolayer InO2 is formed. The preference for monolayer formation of InO2 is explained using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, the band gap of InO2 is calculated to be 4.1 eV, differing from its bulk form (2.7 eV). Furthermore, MOS-based Schottky diode measurements on InO2 intercalated EG/n-SiC demonstrate that the EG/n-SiC junction transforms from ohmic to a Schottky junction upon intercalation, with a barrier height of 0.87 eV and a rectification ratio of ~10^5. These findings introduce a new addition to the 2D dielectric family, showing significant potential for monolayer InO2 to be used as a barrier in vertical electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as an excellent platform for investigating exotic quantum phenomena arising from the interplay between electron correlations and nontrivial topology. However, the microscopic mechanism governing the emergence of both the integer and fractional Chern insulator states in this system remains an open question. In this work, we systematically investigate the electrical transport properties of RMG/hBN moiré devices with controlled alignment orientations and twist angles. We demonstrate that alignment orientation strongly modulates correlated phenomena in the moiré-proximal regime, while having negligible influence on the formation of integer and fractional Chern insulators in the moiré-distant regime. Instead, the moiré periodicity, tuned by the twist angle, serves as the key parameter controlling the stability of these correlated topological states in the moiré-distant regime. Furthermore, in the moiré-proximal regime of one specific alignment, we observe anomalous Hall effect and a variety of competing phases near {\nu} = 1, including integer Chern insulator states, extended Chern insulator states, and trivial insulators, whose stability is highly sensitive to both the applied displacement electric field and magnetic field. Our results underscore the critical role of stacking-alignment and twist-angle engineering in exploring novel quantum states based on rhombohedral-stacked multilayer graphene moiré systems.</p>

            <p>High-mobility oxide heterostructures could be applied for high-frequency devices, transparent conductors, and spin-orbit logic devices. SrTiO$_3$ is one of the most studied oxide substrate materials for heterostructures. To date, the highest SrTiO3-based charge carrier mobility at 2 K was measured in the interfacial 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) of $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$. The formation mechanism and origin of the high electron mobility are not yet fully understood. This investigation presents a successful growth protocol to synthesise high mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces, and a description of the underlying growth optimisation. Furthermore, indicative features of high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, including the room-temperature sheet resistance, are presented. Signs of epitaxial and crystalline growth are found in a high-mobility sample ($\mu^{10K} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{Vs}$). Outlining the growth mechanisms and comparing 40 samples, indicates that high-fluence ($F > 3\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{cm}^2$) and low pressure ($P \approx 1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{mbar}$) are essential growth parameters for high-mobility $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ having single-element cations allows higher laser fluences during growth, compared to thin films with multi-element cations such as LaAlO$_3$, without causing stoichiometric imbalances.</p>

            <p>Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D arrays of laterally covalently bonded $\pi$-conjugated graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials that are receiving increasing attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) is synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, the quantum transport properties of hNPGs are studied. It is found that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). A simple model is proposed to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, it is found that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Naoto Kan, Hidenori Fukaya</p>
            <p>We study a time-reversal invariant vortex, namely a spin vortex, in helical superconductors by focusing on its emergent gravitational structure. The topology of the time-reversal invariant vortex is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant: helical Majorana zero modes appear at the vortex core when the winding number is odd, while no such zero modes exist when it is even. We provide a formal mapping to the theory of gravity to describe this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Identifying a superconducting order parameter as a vielbein in the theory of gravity, we explicitly convert the Bogoliubov-de-Genne Hamiltonian into the Dirac Hamiltonian coupled to a nontrivial gravitational field. Then we find that a gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the energy spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. We further demonstrate that our gravitational framework can be applied to the topological phase transition driven by the vortex-linking precess in three- dimensional helical superconductors such as the He-B phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manabu Sato, Shingo Kobayashi, Motoaki Hirayama, Akira Furusaki</p>
            <p>The Euler class is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariant that characterizes a pair of real bands in a two-dimensional Brillouin zone. One of the symmetries that permits its definition is $C_{2z}T$, where $C_{2z}$ denotes a twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and $T$ denotes time-reversal symmetry. Here, we study three-dimensional spinless insulators characterized by the Euler class, focusing on the case where additional $C_{4z}$ or $C_{6z}$ rotational symmetry is present, and investigate the relationship between the Euler class of the occupied bands and their rotation eigenvalues. We first consider two-dimensional systems and clarify the transformation rules for the real Berry connection and curvature under point group operations, using the corresponding sewing matrices. Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we obtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation eigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to three-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class between the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that relate the difference in the Euler class to two types of representation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We further construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to support our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.</p>

            <h2>Generalized symmetry enriched criticality in (3+1)d</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Moy</p>
            <p>We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions between gapped phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between a gapped phase in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely broken and a phase where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to $\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We characterize the possible patterns of symmetry fractionalization in these phases and provide an explicit lattice model that exhibits the transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for $N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K Shivanand Thakur, Vihodi Theuno, Amrita Mukherjee, Biplab Pal</p>
            <p>In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</p>

Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium DMFT studies.</p>

            <p>While phases and phase transitions are conventionally described by local order parameters in real space, we present a unified framework characterizing the phase transition through the geometry of configuration space defined by the statistics of pairwise distances $r_H$ between configurations. Focusing on the concrete example of Ising spins, we establish crucial analytical links between this geometry and fundamental real-space observables, i.e., the magnetization and two-point spin correlation functions. This link unveils the universal scaling law in the configuration space: the standard deviation of the normalized distances exhibits universal criticality as $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(r_H)}\sim L^{-2\beta/\nu}$, provided that the system possesses zero magnetization and satisfies $4\beta/\nu < d$. We validate this scaling with stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the transverse-field Ising model(TFIM). Furthermore, we propose configuration-space diagnostics that go beyond local real-space observables. First, the distribution probability $P(r_H)$ parameterized by the transverse field $h$ forms a one-dimensional manifold. Information-geometric analyses, particularly the Fisher information defined on this manifold, successfully pinpoint the TFIM phase transition, regardless of the measurement basis. Second, for the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Heisenberg model, a parity index derived from $P(r_H)$ successfully characterizes the symmetry-protected topological phase and its transition. Our work establishes configuration space geometry as a novel perspective on quantum criticality, revealing how macroscopic universal phenomena are encoded within its global statistical features.</p>

            <p>Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--Hückel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is an intrinsic property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could help to explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art developments in magnetic devices rely on manufacturing faster, more efficient memory elements. A significant development in this direction has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital angular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent ferromagnet, and has motivated the search for orbitronic materials displaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect (OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We demonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the bulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by four orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of the Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while incorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study constitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system with inversion symmetry. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an ideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the spin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our results provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic devices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.</p>

            <p>A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic order. In rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene, the angular momentum that breaks TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature at the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (R6G), achieved without the introduction of a moiré superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of R6G. Our findings present crystalline R6G as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insights into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thanh Tran, Phuong Vo, Thomas Sheppard, Timothy Grotjohn, Paul Quayle</p>
            <p>This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Iacovelli, Josep Cabedo, Leticia Tarruell, Alessio Celi</p>
            <p>Topological gauge theories constitute a framework for understanding strongly correlated quantum matter in terms of weakly interacting composite degrees of freedom. Their topological properties become evident when these theories are realized on a space of non-trivial topology. Here, we propose a scheme to realize a one-dimensional topological gauge theory, the chiral BF theory, on a ring geometry. We obtain such a theory by dimensionally reducing Chern-Simons theory on a disk to the so-called chiral BF theory defined on the ring. Then, we encode the theory into a Hamiltonian with a coupling between angular momentum and density, and we propose and numerically benchmark its realization in an optically-dressed Bose gas confined in a ring-shaped trap. There, the topological properties of the underlying theory manifest themselves through a magnetic flux variable that is density-dependent. We quantify such density-dependent magnetic flux in terms of the ground-state angular momentum and the chiral properties of the system through a Bogoliubov analysis. Our proposal enables the observation of the interplay between the topology of the theory and that of the space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeling Xiong, Christopher Heins, Thibaut Devolder, Fabian Kammerbauer, Mathias Kläui, Jürgen Fassbender, Helmut Schultheiss, Katrin Schultheiss</p>
            <p>Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions. Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing, offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time prediction tasks.</p>

            <h2>deGennes-Suzuki-Kubo Quantum Ising Mean Field Dynamics: Applications to Quantum Hysteresis, Heat Engines and Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumyaditya Das, Soumyajyoti Biswas, Muktish Acharyya, Bikas K. Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension (for non-equilibrium cases) of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each component following Suzuki--Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of an oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field, which provides a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes--Suzuki--Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long Zhang, Guangxin Ni, Xuehao Wu, Guoying Gao</p>
            <p>Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or by limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets - exemplified by experimentally feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistances of 11,704%, 2,496% and 1,892%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of the electrodes and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and zero stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and vanishing magnetic moment, combining the advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a practically versatile platform to realize the revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</p>

            <h2>Toward a Deterministic Nucleation Theory for Chirality-Controlled Nanotube Synthesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhengrong Guo</p>
            <p>The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are governed by their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). While chirality-controlled synthesis has achieved notable successes, theoretical understanding remains predominantly focused on post-nucleation growth. Two fundamental obstacles impede deeper insight: the absence of a clear description of nucleation cap topology and its connection to tube chirality, and an incomplete understanding of atomic-level mechanisms governing templated cap formation. Here we address these challenges directly. First, we develop a mathematically rigorous topological framework for carbon networks that provides both a concise definition of cap structures and a quantitative relationship between cap architecture and chirality-the vector sum rule. Second, contrary to conventional perspectives attributing chirality enrichment to edge matching during growth, we demonstrate that chirality is deterministically encoded during nucleation through selective formation of specific cap structures on catalyst surfaces. For the specific case of (12,6) nanotubes, we show that their enrichment arises from a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to catalyst facets. Our deterministic nucleation theory not only provides a coherent explanation for chirality enrichment but also elucidates its pattern in chirality space. This work establishes a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the paradigm from stochastic growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid in mechanical nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyu Rao, Yue-Xin Huang, Guang-Can Guo, Ming Gong</p>
            <p>The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid. We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires, showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical oscillators with currents.</p>

            <h2>Probing Topological Phases in a Strongly Correlated Ladder Model via Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aminul Hussain, Nisa Ara, Rudranil Basu, Sudeshna Sen</p>
            <p>The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Namkyung Lee, Hangyeol Park, Seungwon Jung, Baeksan Jang, Seonyu Lee, Joonho Jang</p>
            <p>Moiré patterns arising from twisted van der Waals stacks fundamentally reshape their electronic properties, enabling band-structure engineering that has driven rapidly growing interest in this field. In studying electronic properties, however, structural disorder present in real devices often leads to twist-angle inhomogeneity and obscures angle-dependent electronic effects when measured with bulk-averaged measurements. Probes that can access local thermodynamic response of the electronic systems with high sensitivity would be highly valuable. Here, we adopt Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to locally investigate graphene-hBN superlattices. By additionally modulating the chemical potential of the system, we obtain the inverse compressibility with high signal-to-noise ratio, enabling extraction of the local thermodynamic DOS. From this information, we determine the local twist angle along the device and find that twist-angle deviations are strongly correlated with bubble-induced strain features. Furthermore, by simultaneously tracking the offsets in the contact potential difference and in the net charge, we identify which interface within the heterostructure hosts the trapped bubbles. This capability to identify local electro-chemical environments provides a practical tool for strain-based studies and future device designs utilizing nanoscale engineering in moiré systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Pal Singh, Ludwig Mathey, Herwig Ott, Luigi Amico</p>
            <p>We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.</p>

            <p>Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roberto da Silva, Henrique A. Fernandes, Paulo G. Freitas, Sebastian Gonçalves, E. V. Stock, A. Alves</p>
            <p>Visibility graphs are spatial interpretations of time series. When derived from the time evolution of physical systems, the graphs associated with such series may exhibit properties that can reflect aspects such as ergodicity, criticality, or other dynamical behaviors. It is important to describe how the criticality of a system is manifested in the structure of the corresponding graphs or, in a particular way, in the spectra of certain matrices constructed from them. In this paper, we show how the critical behavior of an Ising spin system manifests in the spectra of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices constructed from an ensemble of time evolutions simulated via Monte Carlo (MC) Markov Chains, even for small systems and short MC steps. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees -- or its logarithm -- , which represents a kind of \emph{structural entropy} or \emph{topological complexity} here obtained from Kirchhoff's theorem, can, in an alternative way, describe the criticality of the spin system. These findings parallel those obtained from the spectra of correlation matrices, which similarly encode signatures of critical and chaotic behavior.</p>

            <p>Light-matter interaction in frustrated Kagome metals enables access to hidden quantum states, yet the microscopic origin of symmetry breaking under ultrafast excitation remains elusive. Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.</p>

            <p>Stacking faults and other topological defects in ferroics can have a significant influence on the electronic and mechanical properties of the material. Here, regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$ are investigated through transmission electron microscopy, symmetry mode analysis and machine-learned force-field calculations. It is shown that the faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four in the material, owing to the $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell displacement along the b-axis. The four resulting domains emerge as four possible directions of the S$_3$ order parameter, related to NbO$_6$ octahedral tilts in the material. Force-field calculations reveal that the stacking faults are likely placed at positions where the octahedra in neighbouring domains have similar magnitudes of rotation, and that the estimated stacking fault energy is 46 mJ/m$^2$. The investigation shows that the stacking faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, and therefore could affect the ferroelectric properties.</p>

            <p>Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.</p>

            <p>We introduce two kinds of matrix-valued dynamical processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with the additive rank 1 perturbations $\delta J$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the numerically obtained eigenvalues. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero simple eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around $\lambda_0$ are the exact eigenvalues not of the original system, but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. The complex domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$ of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Such separation of exact simple eigenvalues and a degenerated eigenvalue associated with pseudospectrum will be meaningful for numerical analysis, since the former is stable and robust, but the latter is highly sensitive and unstable with respective to perturbations. The present study will be related to the pseudospectra approaches to non-Hermitian systems developed in quantum physics</p>

            <p>Thermal states play a fundamental role in various areas of physics, and they are becoming increasingly important in quantum information science, with applications related to semi-definite programming, quantum Boltzmann machine learning, Hamiltonian learning, and the related task of estimating the parameters of a Hamiltonian. Here we establish formulas underlying the basic geometry of parameterized thermal states, and we delineate quantum algorithms for estimating the values of these formulas. More specifically, we establish formulas for the Fisher--Bures and Kubo--Mori information matrices of parameterized thermal states, and our quantum algorithms for estimating their matrix elements involve a combination of classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. These results have applications in developing a natural gradient descent algorithm for quantum Boltzmann machine learning, which takes into account the geometry of thermal states, and in establishing fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a Hamiltonian, when given access to thermal-state samples. For the latter task, and for the special case of estimating a single parameter, we sketch an algorithm that realizes a measurement that is asymptotically optimal for the estimation task. We finally stress that the natural gradient descent algorithm developed here can be used for any machine learning problem that employs the quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saori Morimoto, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai</p>
            <p>We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</p>

            <p>Ultracold gases of atoms from Main Group III (Group 13) of the Periodic Table, also known as "triel elements," have great potential for a new generation of quantum matter experiments. The first magneto-optical trap of a triel element (indium) was recently realized, but more progress is needed before a triel is ready for modern ultracold quantum science experiments in optical traps. Reaching this regime typically requires atoms that are cooled to the 10 uK level or below, prepared in pure quantum states, and confined in a laser field. Here we report the achievement of all three of these milestones in atomic indium. First, we perform polarization gradient cooling of an indium gas to 15 uK. Second, we spin polarize the gas into a single hyperfine sublevel of either the $5P_{1/2}$ indium ground state or the $5P_{3/2}$ metastable state. Third, we trap indium in a 1064 nm optical lattice, achieving a 3 s trap lifetime. With these results, indium is now a candidate for a next generation quantum research platform.</p>

            <p>Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijie Huang, Ayush Saurabh, Steve Presse</p>
            <p>We investigate the fluctuating incompressible Navier--Stokes equation driven by spatially correlated noise, characterized by a single length scale, and constructed to preserve thermal equilibrium through the corresponding fluctuation--dissipation relation. Numerical simulations reveal that a tracer particle's mean-squared displacement (MSD) depends monotonically on the correlation length \(\ell\) and the correlation strength \(\beta\). Intuitively, increasing \(\ell\) enhances MSD and induces the emergence of an early-time ballistic regime, because a larger correlation length slows viscous momentum diffusion. Counterintuitively, decreasing \(\beta\) also increases the MSD, because a weaker correlation strength decelerates fluid momentum diffusion. Thus, the emergence or suppression of the ballistic regime stems from the competition between momentum correlation and viscous dissipation. We further show that spatial correlation introduces nonlocal momentum diffusion in the hydrodynamic equation, reminiscent of the slow dynamics in glassy and other disordered systems.</p>

            <p>We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena. The computed scaling dimensions agree well with known non-perturbative results, and they lead to new predictions where such results do not yet exist. We thereby expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</p>

            <h2>Universal Frequency Correlations and Recurrence Statistics of Complex Impedance Matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nadav Shaibe, Jared Erb, Thomas M. Antonsen, Steven M. Anlage</p>
            <p>Linear electromagnetic wave scattering systems can be characterized by an impedance matrix that relates the voltages and currents at the ports of the system. When the system size becomes greater than the wavelength of the fields involved, the impedance matrix becomes a complicated function of the details of the system, in which case a statistical model, such as the Random Coupling Model (RCM) becomes useful. The statistics of the elements of the RCM impedance matrix depend on the excitation frequency, the spectral density of the modes of the enclosed system volume, the average loss factor (Q^{-1}) of the system, and the properties of the coupling ports as given by their radiation impedances. In this paper, properties of the elements of impedance matrices are explored numerically and experimentally. These include the two point frequency correlation functions for the complex impedance of elements and the expected difference in frequencies between which impedance values are approximately repeated. Universal scaling arguments are then given for these quantities, hence these results are generic for all sufficiently complicated scattering systems, including acoustic and optical systems. The experimental data presented in this paper come from microwave graphs, billiards, and three-dimensional cavities with embedded tunable perturbers such as metasurfaces. The data is found to be in generally good agreement with the predictions for the two point frequency correlations and the frequency interval for successive repetitions of impedance matrix elements values.</p>

            <h2>A continuous invariant-based asymmetry of a periodic crystal quantifies its deviation from higher symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surya Majumder, Daniel Widdowson, Yury Elkin, Olga Anosova, Andrew I Cooper, Graeme M Day, Vitaliy Kurlin</p>
            <p>Ideal symmetry is known to break down under almost any noise. One measure of asymmetry in a periodic crystal is the relative multiplicity Z' of geometrically non-equivalent units. However, Z' discontinuously changes under almost any displacement of atoms, which can arbitrarily scale up a primitive cell. This discontinuity was recently resolved by a hierarchy of invariant descriptors that continuously change under all small perturbations. We introduce a Continuous Invariant-based Asymmetry (CIA) to quantify (in physically meaningful Angstroms) the deviation of a periodic crystal from a higher symmetry form. Our experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction datasets show that many simulated crystals may be non-synthesisable not only due to high energy but also due to high CIA values, which are much faster to compute. On another hand, many crystals with high Z' values in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) turned out to be close to more symmetric forms with Z'<=1 due to low CIA values.</p>

            <p>We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julio Armando Mojica Zárate</p>
            <p>This work analyzes anisotropic Dirac materials, such as graphene and borophene, under inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields with position-dependent profiles. Exact solutions of the Dirac--Weyl equation are obtained for singular and exponentially decaying interactions, showing how anisotropy and field shape influence the energy spectrum, Landau levels, and state localization. The analysis is further extended using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) in its perturbative form, applied to systems with bounded domains $( -\infty, x_0 ]$ or $( 0, x_0 ]$. In particular, we consider the case $( -\infty, x_0 ]$, where the field vanishes asymptotically. The first-order corrections reveal how the finite range $x_0$ modifies localization and transport, and how a critical electric field emerges at which Landau levels collapse, providing insight into the design of field-defined regions in two-dimensional nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Single-Atom Photocatalysts on TiO2 : Insights from X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingying Li, David Morris, Peng Zhang</p>
            <p>Surface modification of TiO2 with single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective strategy for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. However, thorough characterization of SACs at the atomic scale remains challenging. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) offers unique advantages for the in-depth analysis of TiO2-supported SACs. By employing XAS, the local atomic structure, oxidation state, and electronic properties of the SACs, as well as the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, can be revealed. Herein, we present a short review on the application of XAS in studying TiO2-supported SACs. We first elucidate the key role of XAS in simultaneously probing the structure and electronic properties of monometallic SACs across different periods. Next, we discuss XAS studies of bimetallic SACs from the perspective of each constituent element and highlight the element-specific capabilities of XAS for analyzing multi-element SACs. Finally, we demonstrate how in situ XAS can effectively monitor structural and electronic property changes in SACs under real photocatalytic reaction conditions. Additionally, we provide practical suggestions for utilizing XAS more efficiently in the analysis of various SAC systems.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Cavity Control of the Interlayer Exciton Energy Spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Sanchez-Lopez, Ze-Xun Lin, Di Luo, Prineha narang</p>
            <p>Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.</p>

            <p>Tunable superconductors provide a versatile platform for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate controllable superconductivity in suspended NbSe2 thin layers, achieved through local strain and thermal modulation of the superconducting state. Our results show that suspended NbSe2 structures enable strain modulation of the critical temperature by up to approximately 0.92 K (about 12.5% of the critical temperature) and allow the realization of gate-tunable superconducting critical currents. We further demonstrate configurable hysteretic transport characteristics exhibiting multistability and negative differential resistance, providing easily reconfigurable, spatially dependent superconducting states. These phenomena are well explained by calculations of electron-phonon coupling using density functional theory, together with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau dynamics coupled to the thermal diffusion equation. Our work provides profound insight into strain and thermal modulation of van der Waals superconductors and opens new opportunities for tunable on-chip superconductor devices, integrated superconducting circuits, and quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Bond-dependent magnetic interactions, particularly those described by the Kitaev model, have emerged as a key pathway toward realizing unconventional magnetic states such as quantum spin liquids and topologically nontrivial excitations, including skyrmions. These interactions frustrate conventional magnetic order and give rise to rich collective behavior that continues to challenge both theory and experiment. While Kitaev physics has been extensively explored in the context of honeycomb magnets, direct evidence for its role in real materials remains scarce. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring low-dimensional electrical, magnetic, and correlated electronic phenomena, and provide a fertile ground for potential applications ranging from spintronics to multiferroic devices and quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate, through magneto-transmission, Faraday angle rotation, and magnetic circular dichroism measurements, that the magnetic excitation spectrum of NiI$_2$, a van der Waals multiferroic material, is more accurately captured by a Kitaev-based spin model than by the previously invoked helical spin framework.</p>

            <p>Superconducting diodes, which enable dissipationless supercurrent flow in one direction while blocking it in the reverse direction, are emerging as pivotal components for superconducting electronics. The development of editable superconducting diodes could unlock transformative applications, including dynamically reconfigurable quantum circuits that adapt to operational requirements. Here, we report the first observation of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in LaAlO3/KTaO3 heterostructures, a two-dimensional oxide interface superconductor with exceptional tunability. We observe a strong SDE in Hall-bar (or strip-shaped) devices under perpendicular magnetic fields (< 15 Oe), with efficiencies above 40% and rectification signals exceeding 10 mV. Through conductive atomic force microscope lithography, we demonstrate reversible nanoscale editing of the SDE's polarity and efficiency by locally modifying the superconducting channel edges. This approach enables multiple nonvolatile configurations within a single device, realizing an editable superconducting diode. Our work establishes LAO/KTO as a platform for vortex-based nonreciprocal transport and provides a pathway toward designer quantum circuits with on-demand functionalities.</p>

            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), arising from broken inversion symmetry in ferroelectrics, offers a distinct pathway toward high-efficiency next-generation photovoltaics. We propose and investigate A/A$^\prime$-ordered double perovskites KLaFeMoO$_6$ and NaLaFeMoO$_6$ as promising single-phase ferroelectric photovoltaic (FE-PV) materials. First-principles calculations reveal robust P2$_1$ symmetry with A-site layer and B-site rock-salt ordering, accompanied by hybrid improper ferroelectricity driven by $a^{-}a^{-}c^{+}$ octahedral tilts. Both compounds exhibit significant spontaneous polarization and indirect band gaps of $\sim$ 1.8 eV, well suited for visible-light absorption ($>$10$^5$ cm$^{-1}$). Low carrier effective masses along the polar axis indicate efficient charge transport. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) show that polarization-coupled magnetization switching is feasible above room temperature, making these materials suitable for room-temperature applications.</p>

We study the mechanical stability of a minimal friction-stabilized structure composed of three cylindrical particles arranged in a triangular stack on a floor under gravity. We analyze the yield force, defined as the threshold compressive force applied quasi-statically from above at which the structure collapses due to sliding at the floor contact. Using singular perturbation analysis, we derive an expression which quantitatively predicts the yield force as a function of the static friction coefficient and a small dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ characterizing elastic deformation.</p>

            <p>Various techniques can be employed to determine the temperature of magnetic transformation, whether it be the Curie or Neel temperature. The standard procedure typically involves creating alloys with defined compositions and performing measurements experimentally. Alternatively, these temperatures can be predicted based on a material known physical and chemical properties prior to experiments. We identified an optimal feature set and selected the most effective algorithm. Our findings show that the Voting Ensemble model, when combined with Monte Carlo cross-validation, achieves the highest prediction accuracy. The normalized root mean squared error serves as the primary performance metric. For implementation, we utilize the Azure Machine Learning framework for its robust computational and integration capabilities. This approach offers an efficient and reliable strategy for designing and predicting the Curie temperature of ternary alloys. The paper also highlights potential applications of the model and its extensions for other systems.</p>

            <p>In an isotopically disordered harmonic chain, phonon transmission attenuates exponentially with distance because of multiple scattering by the isotopic defects. We propose a simple method, which is based on the static structure factor, for arranging the isotopic defects to suppress or enhance phonon scattering within a targeted frequency window, resulting in maximization or minimization of phonon transmission. The phononic transparency and opacity effects are demonstrated numerically from the frequency dependence of the transmission coefficient. We briefly discuss how the underlying concept can be extended to the design of aperiodic superlattices to improve or block phononic transmission.</p>

            <p>Lactose is the major component of milk powders and is normally found to be in a glassy/amorphous state. During storage, lactose is known to participate in physicochemical processes, including crystallization on the surface and reaction with proteins such as $\beta$-lactoglobulin. Lactose needs to be mobile to participate in such processes. However, there is a lack of evidence of its mobility in milk powders. In this study, we demonstrate that some of the lactose becomes mobile when milk powders are exposed to humid air $-$ an inappropriate storage condition. This mobility is evidenced by peaks in magic angle spinning $^{1}\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectra of milk powders in the range of 3.5 ppm to 4.0 ppm, which stem from lactose molecules displaying considerable rotational mobility. These signals have a longitudinal relaxation time constant T1 similar to that of mobile water according to 2D T1$-\delta(^{1}\mathrm{H})$ experiments under magic angle spinning. Furthermore, 2D $^{1}\mathrm{H}-^{13}\mathrm{C}$ HSQC magic angle spinning experiments of skim milk powder demonstrate the same fingerprint as that of lactose in the solution, confirming our observations.</p>

            <p>We report the crystal growth, structure, physical properties, and first-principles calculations of a vanadium-based oxytelluride Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O. The material possesses two-dimensional V$_2$O square nets sandwiched by tellurium layers, with local crystallographic symmetry satisfying the spin symmetry for a $d$-wave altermagnet. An antiferromagnetic transition at 293 K is unambiguously evidenced from the measurements of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. In addition, a secondary transition at $\sim$70 K is also observed, possibly associated with a Lifshitz transition. The first-principles calculations indicate robust Néel-type collinear antiferromagnetism in the V$_2$O plane. Consequently, spin splittings show up in momentum space, in relation with the real-space mirror/rotation symmetry. Interestingly, the V-$d_{yz}/d_{xz}$ electrons, which primarily contribute the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface, turns out to be fully orbital- and spin-polarized, akin to the case of a half metal. Our work lays a solid foundation on the potential applications utilizing altermagnetic properties in vanadium-based oxychalcogenides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexis Front, Tapio Ala-Nissila, Miguel A. Caro</p>
            <p>Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remains poorly understood. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal that increasing carbon density reduces pore size and accessibility, thereby modulating the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity ($\approx 400$ mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($<10$\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability.</p>

Using scanning tunneling microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, supported by large-scale mean-field Hubbard calculations, we demonstrate 3 meV exchange couplings at separations beyond 10 nm, surpassing all prior systems. The couplings can be ferro- or antiferromagnetic depending on the relative sublattice arrangement. Real-space mapping of spin excitation amplitudes enables characterization with atomic-resolution. Through atomic manipulation we extend this control to spin trimers, revealing collective spin excitations when pairwise exchange couplings are comparable.</p>

            <p>We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of photovoltage generation in a bilayer graphene (BLG) transistor structure exposed to subterahertz radiation. The device features a global bottom and split top gate, enabling independent control of the band gap and Fermi level, thereby enabling the formation of a tunable p-n junction in graphene. Measurements show that the photovoltage arises primarily through a thermoelectric mechanism driven by heating of the p-n junction in the middle of the channel. We also provide a theoretical justification for the excitation of two-dimensional plasmons at a record-low frequency of 0.13 THz, which manifests itself as characteristic oscillations in the measured photovoltage. These plasmonic resonances, activated by a decrease in charge carrier concentration due to opening of the band gap, lead to a local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and an increase in the carrier temperature in the junction region. The record-low frequency of plasmon resonance is enabled by the low carrier density achievable in the bilayer graphene upon electrical induction of the band gap.</p>

Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the field lowers the nucleation barrier and drives the distribution toward smaller particles. Our results are robust for radii above 3 nm (5740 atoms). Below this scale non-extensive effects likely dominate, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Information. The approach generalizes to both diamagnetic and paramagnetic systems and the limitations expected for very small or ferromagnetically ordered nanoparticles are discussed.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected. In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes. In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.</p>

            <p>We performed high-resolution magnetostriction measurements on the Pauli-limited superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using high-quality single crystals. A first-order superconducting transition, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis, was observed under in-plane magnetic fields, where the relative length change of the sample, $\Delta L/L$, was on the order of $10^{-8}$. To ensure the reliability of the measurements, particular attention was paid to minimizing the influence of magnetic torque, which can significantly affect data under in-plane field configurations, via field-angle-resolved magnetostriction. Within the hysteresis regime, slightly below the Pauli-limited upper critical field, a hump-like anomaly in the magnetostriction coefficient was identified. Furthermore, a characteristic double-peak structure in the field-angle derivative of the magnetostriction provides additional support for this anomaly. Although these findings may reflect a lattice response associated with the emergence of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the possibility of a broadened first-order transition cannot be excluded. Notably, this magnetostriction anomaly qualitatively deviates from the FFLO phase boundary suggested by previous NMR measurements, highlighting the necessity for further experimental and theoretical investigations to elucidate the nature of the FFLO state in this material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhadip Basu, Oded Farago</p>
            <p>Membrane proteins often form dimers and higher-order oligomers whose stability and spatial organization depend sensitively on their lipid environment. To investigate the physical principles underlying this coupling, we employ a lattice Monte Carlo model of ternary lipid mixtures that exhibit liquid-disordered ($L_d$) and liquid-ordered ($L_o$) phase coexistence. In this framework, proteins are represented as small membrane inclusions with tunable nearest neighbor interactions with both lipids and other proteins, allowing us to examine how protein-lipid affinity competes with protein-protein interactions and lipid-lipid demixing. We find that the balance of these interactions controls whether proteins remain dispersed, assemble into small oligomers, or form large stable clusters within $L_o$ domains, and that increasing the protein concentration further promotes coarsening of the ordered phase. To incorporate ligand-regulated activation, we extend the model to a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme in which proteins stochastically switch between inactive and active states with distinct affinities. The inverse switching rate, relative to the time required for a protein to diffuse across the characteristic size of the $L_o$ domains, governs the aggregation behavior. Rapid switching yields only transient small oligomers, slow switching reproduces the static limit with persistent large clusters, and intermediate rates produce broad cluster-size distributions. These results highlight the interplay between lipid phase organization, protein-lipid affinity, and activation dynamics in regulating membrane protein oligomerization, a coupling that is central to signal transduction and membrane organization in living cells.</p>

            <p>In this study, we demonstrate an improved version of the roll-to-roll mechanical exfoliation method, incorporating a controlled sliding motion into the exfoliation process to achieve uniform nanosheet films of two-dimensional materials at wafer-scale. This scalable technique enables the fabrication of high-quality films suitable for electronic and optoelectronic applications. We validate the process by fabricating WSe2 phototransistors directly on the exfoliated films, achieving performance metrics comparable to the best reported devices based on electrochemically exfoliated material. The all-dry transfer method employed ensures minimal contamination and preserves the intrinsic properties of the material. This work highlights the potential of high-throughput mechanical exfoliation as a cost-effective and reliable route for large-scale production of 2D material-based devices.</p>

            <p>Synchronization resulting in unified collective behavior of the individual elements of a system that are weakly coupled to each other has long fascinated scientists. Examples range from the periodic oscillation of coupled pendulum clocks to the rhythmic behavior in biological systems. Here we demonstrate this effect in a solid-state platform: spatially remote, auto-oscillating electron-nuclear spin systems in a semiconductor. When two such oscillators separated by up to 40 ${\mu}$m are optically pumped, their individually different frequencies lock to a common value, revealing long-range coherent coupling. For larger separations, the synchronization breaks. The interaction distance matches the electron spin diffusion length, identifying spin transport as the coupling-mediating mechanism and establishing phase coherence over mesoscopic distances. As a consequence, a wide-area optical pump drives all oscillators within the illuminated spot into a single synchronized state, despite their inhomogeneity. This synchronization accounts for the exceptional stability of the resulting auto-oscillations, enabling collective motion in distributed spin systems and paving the way toward coherent spin networks in spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Controlling viscosity to engineer focal conic domains in photonic cellulose nanocrystal films</h2>

            <p>Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) form cholesteric architectures that can have color specific reflectivity and enable sustainable photonic films. However, achieving uniform color, suppressing iridescence, and accessing ordered defect structures such as focal conic domains remain challenging. Here, we control the photonic properties of CNC films by steering the self assembly process. Across 24 dish-cast films with varying salt concentrations and sonication doses, we combine viscosity measurements, timelapse polarized optical microscopy, and angle-resolved reflectance spectroscopy to correlate evaporation dynamics with photonic structure. We show that viscosity, jointly controlled by NaCl-mediated electrostatic screening and sonication-induced bundle fragmentation, dictates the extent of tactoid coalescence. Low-viscosity suspensions generate large, homogeneous cholesteric domains and narrow spectral responses, while high viscosity leads to arrested, heterogenous domains and increased diffuse light reflection. Critically, within a narrow parameter window of intermediate ionic strength and moderate sonication, we reproducibly engineer photonically active focal conic domains. These results identify viscosity-driven flow as a key, previously underappreciated factor in CNC self-assembly and establish design rules for producing structurally colored films with tunable photonic response, reduced iridescence, and controllable defect architectures.</p>

            <h2>The Microscopic Structure of Stacking Faults in Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Sjökvist, Yining Xie, Zabeada Aslam, Andy P. Brown, Nicholas C. Bristowe, Mark S. Senn, Richard Beanland</p>
            <p>Stacking faults and other topological defects in ferroics can have a significant influence on the electronic and mechanical properties of the material. Here, regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$ are investigated through transmission electron microscopy, symmetry mode analysis and machine-learned force-field calculations. It is shown that the faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four in the material, owing to the $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell displacement along the b-axis. The four resulting domains emerge as four possible directions of the S$_3$ order parameter, related to NbO$_6$ octahedral tilts in the material. Force-field calculations reveal that the stacking faults are likely placed at positions where the octahedra in neighbouring domains have similar magnitudes of rotation, and that the estimated stacking fault energy is 46 mJ/m$^2$. The investigation shows that the stacking faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, and therefore could affect the ferroelectric properties.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic origin of period-four stripe charge-density-wave in kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuma Murata, Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>The interplay between unconventional density waves and exotic superconductivity has attracted growing interest. Kagome superconductors $A\rm{V}_3\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \rm{K}, \rm{Rb}, \rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\rm{Rb}$ and $\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayantan Ghosh, Sugata Paul, Tamoghna Chattoraj, Ritesh Kumar, Zachary Fisk, S. S. Banerjee</p>
            <p>Comprehensive study using DC transport, specific heat, magnetization, and two-coil mutual inductance measurements unveils an understanding of three temperature regimes in SmB$_6$: (i) $T \geq T^{*}$ ($\sim66$K), (ii) $T_g$ ($\sim40$ K) $\leq T < T^{*}$, and (iii) $T < T_g$. Onset of Kondo breakdown below $T^{*}$ releases disorder-driven magnetic fluctuations, which splits the bulk ($\sim116$K) and surface Kondo temperature ($T_k^{s} \approx 7$ K). Below $T_g$, as magnetic fluctuations subside, surface Kondo screening revives, stabilizing the topological surface state and generating an in-gap feature ($\sim2.2$ meV) across which Dirac-like carriers are excited. Nyquist impedance analysis reveals a crossover from purely capacitive to capacitive-inductive behavior, signalling a disorder-driven two-fluid phase of heavy quasiparticles and light, high-mobility carriers below $T_g$. We identify a characteristic length scale, $L_{\nu_0}(T)$, associated with the high-mobility phase, exhibiting an almost divergent trend below $T_k^{s}$. These findings underscore the complex nature of the surface conducting state in SmB$_6$.</p>

            <h2>Why Extensile and Contractile Tissues Could be Hard to Tell Apart</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Rozman, Sumesh P. Thampi, Julia M. Yeomans</p>
            <p>Active nematic models explain the topological defects and flow patterns observed in epithelial tissues, but the nature of active stress-whether it is extensile or contractile, a key parameter of the theory-is not well established experimentally. Individual cells are contractile, yet tissue-level behavior often resembles extensile nematics. To address this discrepancy, we use a continuum theory with two-tensor order parameters that distinguishes cell shape from active stress. We show that correlating cell shape and flow, whether in coherent flows in channels, near topological defects, or at rigid boundaries, cannot unambiguously determine the type of active stress. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous measurements of stress and cell shape are essential to fully interpret experiments investigating the nature of the physical forces acting within epithelial cell layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Gusain, Mohd Zeeshan, B. K. Mani</p>
            <p>Slack's phonon-glass and electron-crystal concept has been the guiding paradigm for designing new thermoelectric materials. Zintl phases, in principle, have been shown as great contenders of the concept and thereby good thermoelectric candidates. With this as motivation, we design new Zintl phases SrBaX (X = Si, Ge, Sn) using state-of-the-art computational methods. Herein, we use first-principles simulations to provide key theoretical insights to thermal and electrical transport properties. Some of the key findings of our work feature remarkably low lattice thermal conductivities ($<$~1~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$), putting proposed materials among the well-known thermoelectric materials such as SnSe and other contemporary Zintl phases. We ascribe such low values to antibonding states induced weak bonding in the lattice and intrinsically weak phonon transport, resulting in low phonon velocities, short lifetimes, and considerable anharmonic scattering phase spaces. Besides, our results on electronic structure and transport properties reveal tremendous performance of SrBaGe ($ZT\sim$ 2.0 at 700~K), highlighting the relevance among state-of-the-art materials such as SnSe. Further, the similar performances for both $p$- and $n$-type dopings render these materials attractive from device fabrication perspective. We believe that our study would invite experimental investigations for realizing the true thermoelectric potential of SrBaX series.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Eckert, Daniel de las Heras, Enrique Velasco, Yuri Martínez-Ratón</p>
            <p>We analyze the sedimentation behavior of a polydisperse two-dimensional liquid-crystal fluid using a local density functional theory based on scaled particle theory. Polydispersity is incorporated through variations in the roundness of hard rectangular particles interacting solely via excluded area effects. Despite its simplicity, the model displays a rich phenomenology. In bulk, the fluid exhibits isotropic, nematic, and tetratic phases. In sedimentation, we obtain complex phase stacking diagrams featuring multiphasic stacking sequences with up to four stacks of different bulk phases, inverted stacking sequences such as top isotropic and bottom nematic together with top nematic and bottom isotopic, as well as stacking sequences with reentrant stacks such as tetratic and nematic stacks floating between two isotropic stacks. This phenomenology arises as a result of an intricate coupling between particle polydispersity and the effect of gravity. Our approach can be easily adapted to investigate the sedimentation behaviour of other polydisperse colloidal systems.</p>

            <p>Dipoles in triangular optical ladders constitute a flexible platform for the study of the interplay between geometric frustration and long-range anisotropic interactions, and in particular for the observation of the spontaneous onset of chirality. Frustration magnifies the effect of the dipolar interactions in itinerant polarized dipolar bosons. As a result, the dipole-induced transition between a chiral superfluid and a non-chiral two-component superfluid may be observed for current state-of-the-art temperatures even for the weak inter-site interaction characterizing magnetic atoms in standard optical lattices. On the other hand, pinned spin-$1/2$ dipoles, which we discuss in the context of polar molecules in two rotational states, realize frustrated dipolar XXZ spin models. By controlling the external electric field strength and orientation, these systems can explore a rich ground-state landscape including chiral and nematic phases, as well as intriguing chiral dynamics.</p>

            <p>The intermediate valence of Ce in CeCo$_5$ challenges standard density functional theory (DFT) and static DFT+$U$ approaches, which fail to capture its magnetic properties. By combining DFT+$U$ with exact diagonalization of the Anderson impurity model for the Ce 4$f$ shell, we find a substantial reduction of Ce spin and orbital moments, consistent with DFT+DMFT, arising from Ce$^{4+}$ - Ce$^{3+}$ valence fluctuations. The total magnetic moment of 6.70 $\mu_B$ agrees with experiment, and the calculated $4f$ density of states reproduces photoemission and Bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy reaches 4.8 meV/f.u. when Coulomb correlations on both Ce 4$f$ and Co 3$d$ shells are included, in very good agreement with experimental data. These results highlight the importance of dynamical correlations and provide guidance for exploring high-performance, low-rare-earth-content permanent magnets.</p>

            <p>We investigate uniaxial-stress effects on the magnetic phase diagram of the square-lattice itinerant magnet EuAl$_{4}$, where strong coupling among spin, lattice, and charge produces a variety of helimagnetic phases, including rhombic and square skyrmion lattices. Combining resistivity and magnetization measurements with neutron scattering, we find that compressive stresses of only several tens of MPa along [010] enhance antiferromagnetic character and shorten the magnetic modulation period in the lowest-temperature single-Q spiral state, thereby driving the critical temperatures and fields of multiple phases to higher values. First-principles calculations show that increasing orthorhombic lattice distortion deforms the Fermi surface relevant to the magnetism, providing compelling evidence that Fermi-surface nesting plays a crucial role in stabilizing the helical magnetic modulations in EuAl$_{4}$.</p>

            <p>Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Humaira Zafar, Mauro Fernandes Pereira</p>
            <p>This paper delivers the first report of a mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide array design that employs complementary and asym- metric tapered Euler-shaped bends. These provide greater fabrication flexibility to achieve subwavelength-pitch integration while reducing crosstalk to below 30 dB across the 3.1 to 3.6 micron wavelength range. Unlike previous designs, which main- tained constant waveguide widths, the Euler waveguide bends are characterized by asymmetric and complementary tapered waveguide widths. This approach significantly reduces crosstalk to below 30 dB for both the first and second neighboring waveguides across a 500 nm wavelength range, enhancing the efficiency of optical phased arrays (OPA) with a large field of view, optimizing light propagation and minimizing crosstalk. The waveguide array is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, with a 2-micron buried oxide layer and a 500 nm-thick silicon layer. The design is highly tolerant to fabrication variations, maintaining consistent performance even with width variations. The spectral responses, simulated using the 3D finite-difference time-domain method, demonstrate negligible coupling and low insertion loss across the wavelength range. This work offers a robust and CMOS-compatible solution for MIR integrated photonic circuits.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamical formation of nonlinear patterns in one-dimensional ring condensates under bichromatic periodic modulation of the interaction strength. The stability phase diagram of the condensate's homogeneous density state is analytically derived through a suitable biharmonic variant of the Mathieu equation and computing the associated Floquet spectrum. It reveals the complex interplay between the driving parameters, i.e., amplitude, frequencies, and the so-called frequencies' mixing angle, which dictate the instability onset and the selective enhancement of higher-order resonance tongues, thus offering precise control over the excited modes. These results are in agreement with time-dependent mean-field simulations evidencing the emergence of density wave modulations of specific momenta, while enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear stage of the relevant instability. Further insights on the ensuing unstable nonlinear dynamics are provided through a reduced {five-mode} model which captures the instability onset, the oscillatory behavior of the mode populations and the phase-space dynamics, in agreement with the mean-field predictions. Our study highlights the versatility of bichromatic driving to generate and control complex nonlinear patterns that are within reach in present day ultracold atom experiments.</p>

            <p>Atomically thin silver (Ag) films offer unique opportunities in plasmonic, quantum optics, and energy harvesting, yet conventional growth methods struggle to achieve structural control at the monolayer limit. Here, we demonstrate phase-selective synthesis of large-area, crystalline 2D Ag films via defect-engineered confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet) at the epitaxial graphene/silicon carbide (EG/SiC) interface. By tuning graphene growth and post-growth defect introduction, two distinct Ag phases are achieved with disparate properties: a nearly commensurate Ag(1) lattice stabilized by vacancy and line defects in epitaxial graphene, and a denser Ag(2) phase preferentially grown with sp3-rich zero-layer graphene. Structural and spectroscopic characterization confirm lattice registry with the SiC substrate, while theoretical calculations reveal a thermodynamic preference for Ag(2) but an easier nucleation for Ag(1). Both phases are found to be semiconducting, with the Ag(2) phase exhibiting slightly enhanced n-doping of graphene. Notably, nonlinear optical measurements reveal a three-order magnitude difference in second-order susceptibility between the two phases, demonstrating promise for phase-tunable 2D metals in reconfigurable optoelectronic and metamaterial platforms.</p>

            <p>Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.</p>

            <p>The manufacturing processes of heterostructures determine the structure and properties of their interfaces. In this work, we simulate PbTe and PbSe heterostructures manufactured via (1) direct wave bonding and (2) heteroepitaxial growth. The former contains interfaces with 2D misfit dislocation networks while the latter contains complex 3D networks with both misfit and threading dislocations. To compute the surface energy of interfaces, we measure the interaction energy across surfaces using a well-verified code. Compared with hypothetical interfaces modeled to be coherent, a typical assumption in traditional slab-based methods, the surface energy of wafer bonded and epitaxially grown interfaces are significantly different. Semi-coherent interfaces exhibit up to ~27% lower surface energies than coherent ones, while coherent models overestimate surface energies by up to ~50% relative to epitaxial interfaces. The consequence of such differences can lead to conflicting predictions of physical phenomena such as fracture toughness or growth mode.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muneeb ur Rahman</p>
            <p>The catalytic CO2 photoreduction to CO is significantly hindered by the pervasive kinetic bottleneck of *CO-desorption and inefficient charge separation. Surpassing the conventional single photocatalytic strategy, herein, a multi-synergetic 0D/1D S-scheme heterojunction by precisely assembling 0D InVO4 nanoparticles on 1D Cu-doped TbFeO3 (IVO/CTFO). This nano-heterojunction is rationally designed at multiple steps where Cu2+ substitution at the Fe3+ site induces a compression in lattice strain and oxygen vacancies (VO), acting as electron traps and CO2 chemisorption sites, which breaks spin-polarization of pristine TbFeO3 to facilitate multichannel charge flow. The 0D/1D strategy couples the maximum surface active-sites and short charge diffusion routes with directional charge migration. Moreover, a 0D/1D lattice mismatch creates a built-in electric field at the interface, resulting in an enhanced lifetime (64.70 ns) of charged species, an efficient CO yield (65.75 mmole g-1.h-1), and high selectivity (95.93%). DFT calculations and experimental findings confirmed the Fermi level shift toward the conduction band and the existence of spin-hybridization. Operando-DRIFTS and the free-energy diagram unveil a H+ mediated mechanism at the interface, alongside a reduction in energy barrier for CO2 photoreduction from *COOH to *CO. Thus, this study presents an excellent approach that integrates defect-engineering, strain-compression, and interfacial design in advancing solar fuels production.</p>

            <p>Among all-inorganic halide perovskites, the only known ferroelectrics are the family of CsGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I). Here, we study their ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) and common point defects by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and investigate the interplay between DWs and defects. The most stable defects are V$_{\text{X}}$ and V$_{\text{Cs}}$ and the former shows low migration barriers and high mobility. In contrast to oxide ferroelectrics, the affinity between point defects and DWs is negligible, reflecting the subtle structural distortions at CsGeX$_3$ DWs. Concomitantly, the formation energies and migration energy barriers of CsGeX$_3$ DWs are small compared to oxides, and neither V$_{\text{X}}$ nor V$_{\text{Cs}}$ pin migrating DWs. The band gap invariance across DWs and the lack of affinity towards intrinsic charged point defects imply that conducting DWs for nanoelectronics may be challenging to realise in CsGeX$_3$. However, shallow $p$-type defect levels and low hole effective masses suggest that high $p$-type conductivity may be achievable in nominally ferroelectric CsGeX$_3$. The low DW migration energy barriers and insignificant DW pinning by point defects make CsGeX$_3$ promising materials as robust soft ferroelectrics for high-frequency switching applications with low energy dissipation.</p>

            <h2>Controlling Quantum Transport in a Superconducting Device via Dissipative Baths</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. V. Aksenov, M. S. Shustin, I. S. Burmistrov</p>
            <p>Within the quantum field-theoretical approach describing the evolution of a quadratic Liouvillian in the basis of Keldysh contour coherent states, we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to normal Fermi reservoirs. We derive a generalization of the Meir-Wingreen formula and Onsager matrix for a superconducting system subject to an arbitrary number of fermionic baths. Following Kirchhoff's rule, we obtain an expression describing the dissipation induced loss current and formulate modified quantum kinetic equations. For wide-band contacts locally coupled to individual sites, we find that each contact reduces the degeneracy multiplicity of the non-equilibrium steady state by one. These results are numerically verified through several cases of the extended Kitaev model at symmetric points with a single contact. Furthermore, in the linear response regime at low temperatures, we demonstrate that (non-)degenerate non-equilibrium steady states correspond to (non-)quantized conductance peaks. Revisiting a paradigmatic problem of resonant transport in the Majorana mode of the Kitaev model we demonstrate that the dissipation accounts for the zero-bias peak suppression and its asymmetry.</p>

            <h2>Relaxation time for competing short- and long-range interactions in the model A dynamic universality class</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-François de Kemmeter, Stefano Ruffo, Stefano Gherardini</p>
            <p>We study the relaxation dynamics at criticality in the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Nagle-Kardar model, where short- and long-range interactions can compete. The phase diagram of this model shows lines of first and second-order phase transitions, separated by a tricritical point. We consider Glauber dynamics, focusing on the slowing-down of the magnetization $m$ both along the critical line and at the tricritical point. Starting from the master equation and performing a coarse-graining procedure, we obtain a Fokker-Planck equation for $m$ and the fraction of defects. Using central manifold theory, we analytically show that $m$ decays asymptotically as $t^{-1/2}$ along the critical line, and as $t^{-1/4}$ at the tricritical point. This result implies that the dynamical critical exponent is $z=2$, proving that the macroscopic critical dynamics of the Nagle-Kardar model falls within the dynamic universality class of purely relaxational dynamics with a non-conserved order parameter (model A). Large deviation techniques enable us to show that the average first passage time between local equilibrium states follows an Arrhenius law.</p>

            <p>The Kondo effect emerges when a localized spin is screened by conduction electrons, giving rise to a strongly-correlated many-body ground state. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot, focusing on the spatial extension of the Kondo screening cloud in the electron reservoirs. To probe its properties, the dot is coupled to an electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometer, enabling controlled modulation of the density of states at the Fermi level. The observation of Kondo temperature oscillations indicates a Kondo screening length comparable to the cavity size. Furthermore, we explore how the coupling asymmetry with the two reservoirs affects both the amplitude and the phase of the conductance oscillations, revealing a subtle interplay between coherent transport and Kondo effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsz Wai Ko, Runze Liu, Adesh Rohan Mishra, Zihan Yu</p>
            <p>Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateo Cárdenes Wuttig</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that a machine learning framework based on kernel ridge regression can encode and predict the self-energy of one-dimensional Hubbard models using only mean-field features such as static and dynamic Hartree-Fock quantities and first-order GW calculations. This approach is applicable across a wide range of on-site Coulomb interaction strengths $U/t$, ranging from weakly interacting systems ($U/t \ll 1$) to strong correlations ($U/t > 8$). The predicted self-energy is transformed via Dyson's equation and analytic continuation to obtain the real-frequency Green's function, which allows access to the spectral function and density of states. This method can be used for nearest-neighbor interactions $t$ and long-range hopping terms $t'$, $t''$, and $t'''$.</p>

            <h2>From Fresh to Salty: How Ions Modulate Solvent-Mediated Interactions between Grafted Silica Nanoparticles in Water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuvraj Singh, Chandan K. Choudhury, Rakesh S. Singh</p>
            <p>Nanoparticles (NPs) are fundamental building blocks for engineering functional soft materials, where precise control over the solvent-mediated inter-particle effective interaction (Ueff) is essential for tailoring bulk structure and properties. These solvent-mediated interactions are strongly influenced by NP's surface chemistry, solvent properties, and thermodynamic conditions such as temperature (T) and pressure (P). However, despite considerable progress, a general predictive framework for tuning Ueff and guiding self-assembly remains lacking. In this work, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the alteration of Ueff between silica nanoparticles (Si-NPs) functionalized with polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) by salt (sodium chloride) across a range of thermodynamic conditions. At ambient thermodynamic conditions, bare (not functionalized) Si-NPs exhibit minimal variation in Ueff even at high salt concentrations. In contrast, PE-grafted Si-NPs display strong salt-induced attractions, while PEG-grafted Si-NPs show an intermediate, more gradual response. To asses the transferability of these salt-induced effects on effective interactions, we further examined the effects of salt on Ueff under different (T,P) conditions. Our results indicate that the salt-induced modulation of Ueff between both bare and grafted Si-NPs is largely invariant across the explored (T,P) conditions. Molecular-level analysis reveals that salt promotes solvent depletion within the interparticle cavity for both hydrophobic PE and hydrophilic PEG grafts, with the strongest effect observed in the PE case. In general, this study highlights the coupled roles of surface chemistry, ion-polymer interactions, and solvent structuring in the regulation of Ueff, and provides important insights into the predictable control of interparticle interactions for soft material engineering.</p>

            <p>We present a density-functional theory study of the effects of oxygen vacancies on the structural and electronic properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$). Our motivation is the reported suppression of the metal-insulator transition by oxygen vacancies and the lack of a clear consensus on its origin. We use the DFT$+V$ method with a static intersite vanadium-vanadium interaction term, $V$, to calculate the properties of the oxygen-deficient metallic rutile and insulating monoclinic M1 phases of VO$_2$ on the same footing. We find that oxygen vacancies induce local distortions in the M1 phase, but do not destroy the dimerization usually associated with the insulating behavior. In spite of this, we find that the M1 phase becomes metallic as a result of the partial filling of the conduction band due to a rigid-band-like doping effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiaoyi Li, Dai-Wei Qu, Bin-Bin Chen, Tao Shi, Wei Li</p>
            <p>Numerical simulations of strongly correlated fermions at finite temperature are essential for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other quantum many-body phenomena. The recently developed tangent-space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) provides an efficient and accurate framework by representing thermal density operators as matrix product operators. However, the particle number generally varies during the cooling process. The conventional strategy of fine-tuning chemical potentials to reach a target filling is computationally demanding. Here we propose a fixed-$N$ tanTRG algorithm that stabilizes the average particle number by adaptively tuning the chemical potential within the imaginary-time evolution. We benchmark its accuracy on exactly solvable free fermions, and further apply it to the square-lattice Hubbard model. For hole-doped cases, we study the temperature evolution of charge and spin correlations, identifying several characteristic temperature scales for stripe formation. Our results establish fixed-$N$ tanTRG as an efficient and reliable tool for finite-temperature studies of correlated fermion systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Walther, Josef Willsher, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is an archetypal example of a topological phase transition, which is driven by the proliferation of vortices. In this Letter, we analyze the persistence of the BKT transition in the XY model under the influence of long-range algebraically decaying interactions of the form $\sim 1/{r^{2+\sigma}}$. The model hosts a magnetized low temperature phase for sufficiently small $\sigma$. Crucially, in the presence of long-range interactions, spin waves renormalize the interaction between vortices, which stabilizes the BKT transition. As a result, we find that there is no direct transition from the magnetized to the disordered phase and that the BKT transition persists for arbitrary long-range exponents, which is distinct from previous results. We use both Landau-Peierls-type arguments and renormalization group calculations - including a coupling between spin wave and topological excitations - and obtain similar results. We emphasize that Landau-Peierls-type arguments are a powerful tool for analyzing continuous spin models. We discuss the relevance of our findings for current Rydberg atom experiments, and highlight the importance of long-range couplings for other types of topological defects.</p>

            <p>Faraday waves, typically observed in driven fluids, result from the confluence of nonlinearity and parametric amplification. Here we show that optical pulses can generate analogous phenomena that persist much longer than the pump time-scales in ordered quantum solids. We present a theory of ultrafast light-matter interactions within a symmetry-broken state; dynamical nonlinear coupling between the Higgs (amplitude) and the Goldstone (phase) modes drives an emergent phason texture that oscillates in space and in time: Faraday-Goldstone waves. Calculated signatures of this spatiotemporal order compare well with measurements on K$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$; Higgs-Goldstone beating, associated with coherent energy exchange between these two modes, is also predicted. We show this light-generated crystalline state is robust to thermal noise, even when the original Goldstone mode is not. Our results offer a new pathway for the design of periodic structures in quantum materials with ultrafast light pulses.</p>

Using symmetry analysis of the single-particle Green's function, we classify spectral functions by irreducible representations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Complementarily, we calculate the one-body reduced density matrix which allows us to reach both a qualitative description of charge distribution and an analysis of the state purity. Moreover, within the Tensor Network framework, we employ a Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to confirm the presence of three distinct phases and their corresponding phase transitions. Our results highlight how symmetry-labelled spectral functions and effective orbital analysis provide accessible single-particle tools for probing correlation-driven insulating phases.</p>

We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9° sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity.

            <h2>Machine-Learning Accelerated Calculations of Reduced Density Matrices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Awwab A. Azam, Lexu Zhao, Jiabin Yu</p>
            <p>$n$-particle reduced density matrices ($n$-RDMs) play a central role in understanding correlated phases of matter. Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\times 6 \sim 8\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\%$ and $92.78\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations. Our results illustrate the potential of using NN-based methods for interpolable $n$-RDMs, which might open a new avenue for future research on strongly correlated phases.</p>

However, these three phases are distinct, forming plaquette order, topological dimer order, and non-topological dimer order, respectively. Our findings are based on a cross-validation between variational two-dimensional tensor network calculations: an unrestricted exploration of symmetry-broken states versus the detection of symmetry breaking from cat-state behavior in symmetry-restricted states. The origin of different orders can also be understood from a theoretical analysis.

Among the various integration approaches, Cu-Cu hybrid bonding has emerged as a leading solution for achieving high interconnect density in chiplet integration. In this work, we present YAP+, a yield modeling framework specifically tailored for wafer-to-wafer (W2W) and die-to-wafer (D2W) hybrid bonding processes. YAP+ incorporates a comprehensive set of yield-impacting failure mechanisms, including overlay misalignment, particle defects, Cu recess variations, surface roughness, and Cu pad density. Furthermore, YAP+ supports pad layout-aware yield analysis, considering critical, redundant, and dummy pads across arbitrary 2D physical layout patterns. To support practical evaluation, we developed an open-source yield simulator, demonstrating that our near-analytical model matches simulation accuracy while achieving over 1,000x speedup in runtime. This performance makes YAP+ a valuable tool for co-optimizing packaging technologies, assembly design rules, and system-level design strategies. Beyond W2W-D2W comparisons, we leverage YAP+ to investigate the impact of pad layout patterns, bonding pitch, and pad ratios across different pad types, and explore the benefits of strategically placing redundant pad replicas.</p>

            <p>Structurally nanoengineered antimicrobial peptide polymers (SNAPPs) are emerging as promising selective agents against bacterial membranes. In this study, we used all atom molecular dynamics simulation techniques to investigate the interaction of a promising cationic SNAPP architecture (Alt-SNAPP with 8 arms made of alternating lysine and valine residues) with modelled Gram-negative, Gram-positive, mammalian, and red blood cell membranes. Alt-SNAPP exhibited rapid and stable binding to bacterial membranes, driven by electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), and supported by membrane fluidity. In contrast, mammalian and red blood cell membranes, enriched in zwitterionic lipids and cholesterol, resisted peptide association entirely. Analyses of center of mass distance, partial density, hydrogen bonding, and interaction energy confirmed that SNAPP remains fully excluded from host like membranes while forming stable, multivalent interactions with bacterial bilayers. These findings provide mechanistic insight into membrane selectivity of SNAPP and offer a molecular framework for designing next generation antimicrobial polymers with minimal off target toxicity.</p>

Here, we investigate the transport and spatial distribution of binary gas mixtures in a porous metal organic framework, viz., ZIF-90, using molecular simulations. We perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to examine the competitive adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from a binary gas mixture in ZIF-90, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to investigate the transport behavior of the adsorbed molecules within the framework. These integrated simulations reveal that the framework topology and pore chemistry jointly dictate diffusion pathways and preferential occupancy of gas species, underscoring their intrinsic interdependence. Competitive adsorption leads to distinct spatial partitioning within the pores, which in turn modulates mixture diffusivity inside the porous medium compared to their bulk properties. Our results provide molecular-level insight into how ZIF-90 accommodates and separates gas mixtures, offering design principles for optimizing metal-organic frameworks in energy and environmental applications.</p>

Our stability criterion is in terms of the explicit form of the nonlinearity and the projection of distinguished vectors onto the flat band eigenspace. We apply our general results to MCS states of DNLS for the diamond, Kagom{é} and checkerboard lattices. In lattices where MCS states are unstable, we demonstrate how to engineer the nonlinearity to stabilize small amplitude MCS states.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ki-Seok Kim, Arpita Mitra, Debangshu Mukherjee, Seung-Jong Yoo</p>
            <p>We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $\beta$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.</p>

            <h2>Unveiling architectural and optoelectronic synergies in lead-free perovskite/perovskite/kesterite triple-junction monolithic tandem solar cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md. Faiaad Rahman, Md. Ashaduzzaman Niloy, Ehsanur Rahmana, Ahmed Zubair</p>
            <p>The widespread use of lead-based materials in tandem solar cells raises critical environmental and health concerns due to their inherent toxicity and risk of contamination. To address this challenge, we focused on lead-free tandem architectures based on non-toxic, environmentally benign materials such as tin-based perovskites and kesterites, which are essential for advancing sustainable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively. We simulated the optical and electrical characteristics of these devices using the finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, explicitly considering radiative, non-radiative, and surface recombination mechanisms. The optimized all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.3%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.74 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.227 V, and fill factor (FF) of 83.14%. Conversely, the optimized triple-junction hybrid perovskite-kesterite architecture secured an elevated PCE of 30.69%, along with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%. These findings reveal the strong potential of lead-free perovskite and kesterite material based absorbers in promoting high-performance hybrid tandem solar cells, highlighting their importance in advancing sustainable and efficient photovoltaic technologies.</p>

            <p>Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work. We here report the experimental realization of a fully quantum engine that converts quantum coherence into work. A single solid-state spin in diamond is fueled by a coherent bath and cyclically stores energy in a spin quantum battery. We establish quantum-enhanced performance by showing that almost 200$\%$ more work is produced after a few cycle compared to the corresponding classical engine. We obtain concrete criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and highlight the importance of a coherent motor-battery interaction. This device harnesses nonclassical features during all stages of its cycle, and demonstrates the functionality of a nanomachine whose parts are all quantum coherent.</p>

            <h2>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sang Hoon Lee</p>
            <p>The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This document establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</p>

            <h2>Chiral Anomaly of Kogut-Susskind Fermion in (3+1)-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shoto Aoki, Yoshio Kikukawa, Toshinari Takemoto</p>
            <p>We consider Kogut-Susskind fermions (also known as staggered fermions) in a $(3+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism and examine a chiral transformation and its associated chiral anomaly. The Hamiltonian of the massless Kogut-Susskind fermion has symmetry under the shift transformations in each space direction $S_k \, (k=1,2,3)$, and the product of the three shift transformations in particular (the odd shifts in general) may be regarded as a unitary discrete chiral transformation, modulo two-site translations. The hermitian part of the transformation kernel $\Gamma = i S_1 S_2 S_3$ can define an axial charge as $Q_A = (1/2)\sum_x \chi^\dagger(x) \left(\Gamma+\Gamma^\dagger \right)\chi(x)$, which is non-onsite, nonquantized, and commutative with the vector charge, analogous to $\tilde{Q}_A = (1/2) \sum_n ( \chi^\dagger_n \chi_{n+1} + \chi^\dagger_{n+1} \chi_{n} )$ for the $(1+1)$ dimensional Kogut-Susskind fermion. However, our $Q_A$ cannot be expressed in terms of any quantized charges in a generalized Onsager algebra. Although $Q_A$ does not commute with the fermion Hamiltonian in general when coupled to background link gauge fields, we show that they become commutative for a class of $U(1)$ link configurations carrying nontrivial magnetic and electric fields. We then verify numerically that the vacuum expectation value of $Q_A$ satisfies the anomalous conservation law of axial charge in the continuum two-flavor theory under an adiabatic evolution of the link gauge field.</p>

            <h2>A Bilayer Cathode Design Procedure for Li ion Batteries Using the Multilayer Doyle-Fuller-Newman Model (M-DFN)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. C. Tredenick, A. M. Boyce, R. Drummond, S. R. Duncan</p>
            <p>Heterogeneities in lithium ion batteries can be significant factors in electrode under utilisation and degradation while charging. Bilayer electrodes have been proposed as a convenient and scalable way to homogenise the electrode response. In this paper, the design of a bilayer cathode for Li-ion batteries composed of separate layers of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC622) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) is optimised using the multilayer Doyle-Fuller-Newman (M-DFN) model. Changes to the carbon binder domain, electrolyte volume fraction, and tortuosity provided the greatest control for improving Li-ion charge mobility. The optimised bilayer design was able to charge at 3C between 0-90% SOC in 18.6 minutes, achieving 4.4 mAh/cm2. Comparing the optimal bilayer to the LFP-only electrode, the bilayer achieved 41% higher capacity. Through mechanistic physics-based modelling, it was shown that the 3C charging improvement of the optimised bilayer was achieved by enabling a more homogeneous current density distribution through the thickness of the electrode and electrolyte depletion prevention. The findings were confirmed on a high-fidelity X-ray computed tomography (CT) based microstructural model. The results illustrate how modelling can be used to rapidly search novel electrode designs</p>

            <h2>Global Buckley--Leverett for Multicomponent Flow in Fractured Media: Isothermal Equation-of-State Coupling and Dynamic Capillarity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Tantardini, Fernando Alonso-Marroquin</p>
            <p>We present an isothermal Global Buckley--Leverett framework for multicomponent, multiphase flow in porous and fractured media that retains the interpretability of classical Buckley--Leverett while incorporating essential physics: equation of state-based phase behavior, multicomponent Maxwell--Stefan diffusion, dynamic capillarity, stress-sensitive permeability, and non-Darcy fracture flow. The formulation yields a single global-pressure equation driving the total Darcy flux and an exact fractional-flow decomposition of phase velocities with buoyancy and capillary drifts; inertial effects enter as per-phase damping that renormalizes mobilities. Crucially, the combination of Maxwell--Stefan diffusion and dynamic capillarity renders transport pseudo-parabolic, resolving the loss of strict hyperbolicity that plagues three-phase Buckley--Leverett and ensuring a well-posed initial-value problem. In practice, each time step solves the scalar global-pressure equation, reconstructs phase fluxes via the split, and advances strictly conservative component balances; axisymmetric (cylindrical) forms for radial injection with vertical buoyancy are provided. The model reduces exactly to classical Buckley--Leverett when added physics are disabled, making it a practical backbone for carbon storage and contaminant transport in fractured, compositionally complex reservoirs.</p>

            <h2>Do Discrete Fine-Scale Mechanical Models with Rotational Degrees of Freedom Homogenize Into a Cosserat or a Cauchy Continuum?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Eliáš, Gianluca Cusatis</p>
            <p>This article answers the question of whether homogenization of discrete fine-scale mechanical models, such as particle or lattice models, gives rise to an equivalent continuum that is of Cauchy-type or Cosserat-type. The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other. Finally, the study demonstrates that cases for which the Cosserat character of the homogenized response is significant are associated with non-physically high fine-scale bending stiffness and, as such, are of no interest in practice.</p>

We find that for strong coupling of transmon to a waveguide emitted photons show correlation in frequency and can have the same energies, even if the three-level system is anharmonic.</p>

This decomposition uncovers a multiscaling in the 2D inverse cascade, which remains obscured when using conventional structure functions. Our results highlight a decoupling between velocity amplitude and flow geometry, offering new insight into the statistical structure of turbulent cascades as well as showing how different classes of multiscaling emerge.</p>

            <p>The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.</p>

            <h2>Quantum algorithm for one quasi-particle excitations in the thermodynamic limit via cluster-additive block-diagonalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumeet, M. Hörmann, K.P. Schmidt</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.</p>

            <h2>Local metamaterials and transition layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimya Yadollahpour, Hossein Khodavirdi, Ankit Srivastava</p>
            <p>In this paper, we elucidate the concept of local acoustic metamaterials. These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nitesh Kumar Patro, Washington Taylor, Akshit Goyal</p>
            <p>Species-rich ecosystems often exhibit multiple stable states with distinct species compositions. Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of number entropy in a chain of free fermions subjected to both defects and stochastic processes. For a special class of defects, namely conformal defects, we present analytical and numerical results for the temporal growth of number entropy, the time evolution of the number distribution, and the eigenvalue profile of the associated correlation matrix within a subsystem. We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects. When stochastic processes are introduced, specifically Stochastic Unitary Processes (SUP) and Quantum State Diffusion (QSD), the number entropy scales as $\ln(t)$ in the SUP case and shows strong hints of $\ln [\ln(t)]$ scaling in the QSD case. These findings establish compelling evidence that number entropy grows logarithmically slower than the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy across a wide class of systems.</p>

Consequently, monomer vacancies destabilize the lattice due to the inherent structural loss of tubulin-tubulin contacts and the additive acceleration of fracture through multiple seams. Importantly, the comparison of our simulations with experiments on lattice fracture suggests that the intrinsic ratio of longitudinal to lateral binding energies is bounded at approximately 1.5, challenging previous predictions of lattice anisotropy from tip-growth models and highlighting the urgent need to incorporate into current growth models parameters obtained from lattice dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janani G, Deepak Bhat</p>
            <p>In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.</p>

            <p>Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are uniquely capable of providing exact simulations of quantum many-body systems. Unfortunately, the applications of a QMC simulation are limited because extracting dynamic properties requires solving the analytic continuation (AC) problem. Across the many fields that use QMC methods, there is no universally accepted analytic continuation algorithm for extracting dynamic properties, but many publications compare to the maximum entropy method. We investigate when entropy maximization is an acceptable approach. We show that stochastic sampling algorithms reduce to entropy maximization when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We investigate when is Bryan's controversial optimization algorithm [Bryan, Eur. Biophys. J. 18, 165-174 (1990)] for entropy maximization (sometimes known as the maximum entropy method) appropriate to use. We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage. We support these results by solving the double Gaussian problem using both Bryan's algorithm and the newly formulated dual approach to entropy maximization [Chuna et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 58, 335203 (2025)].</p>

            <p>Hybrid photonic circuits, harnessing the complementary strengths of multiple materials, represent a key resource to enable compact, scalable platforms for quantum technologies. In particular, the availability of bright sources of tunable biphoton states is eagerly awaited to meet the variety of applications currently under development. In this work we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated device that merges biphoton generation and on-chip quantum state engineering, combining an AlGaAs photon-pair source with a CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) circuit. Photon pairs are generated in the C telecom band via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and transferred to the SOI chip through a multimode evanescent coupling scheme. This design achieves a pair generation rate above 10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$ and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 600. Crucially, the coupling design induces strong and predictable transformations of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude, enabling complex quantum state engineering entirely on-chip in a compact device compliant with electrical pumping.</p>

            <h2>A Comprehensive Approach to Finite-Bath Open Quantum Systems: Exact Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>Here, we develop the exact dynamics of the central spin model, modeling a finite-bath open quantum system. Particularly, two different types of interactions are investigated between the system and the bath: Heisenberg interaction with constant interaction strength, and a stochastic time-dependent interaction. In the former case, a new quantum channel is characterized, while the latter elucidates the microscopic understanding of a very well-known non-Markovian quantum channel. Exact master equations are provided in both scenarios. This is achieved by developing a new technique for obtaining a master equation from the map, making use of the concept of a minimal dissipator. This paves the way for a foundational understanding of finite-bath open quantum systems and a number of novel applications in the vast domain of quantum physics, one of which, implemented here, is in quantum thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Matrix-product state skeletons in Onsager-integrable quantum chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imogen Camp, Nick G. Jones</p>
            <p>Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mriganka Basu Roy Chowdhury, Shirshendu Ganguly, Vilas Winstein</p>
            <p>Independent sets in graphs are sets of vertices containing no neighbors, and they represent a canonical spin system with hardcore constraints. Of particular interest is the setting of the boolean hypercube, where counting independent sets was the original motivator for Sapozhenko's famous graph container method. A modern perspective on such problems is to consider the effect of disorder, and the study of independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube obtained via bond percolation with parameter $p$ was initiated by Kronenberg and Spinka. They employed tools from statistical mechanics to obtain detailed information about the moments of the number of independent sets (now a random variable), and posed many interesting questions. Previous work by the authors addressed many of these questions in the regime $p \geq \frac{2}{3}$, where the behavior is relatively simple and can be modeled well by a related family of independent particles. As $p$ decreases, though, typical independent sets become larger and feature more intricate clustering behavior. In the present article we overcome many of the challenges presented by this phenomenon and analyze the model for all $p> 0.465$. We obtain a sharp in-probability approximation for the number of independent sets in the percolated hypercube in terms of explicit random variables, as well as provide a sampling algorithm. Note that this shows, curiously, that $p = \frac{1}{2}$ is not a natural barrier for this problem unlike in many other problems where it appears as a point of a phase transition. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of a new probabilistic framework to handle the clustering behavior for these low values of $p$. Although our analysis is restricted to $p > 0.465$, our arguments are expected to be helpful for studying this model at even lower values of $p$, and possibly for other related problems.</p>

            <h2>Effect of shape on void growth: A coupled Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) and Discrete Dislocation Plasticity (DDP) study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Usman, Sana Waheed, Aamir Mubashar</p>
            <p>Voids are one of the many material defects present at the microscopic length scale. They are primarily responsible for the formation of cracks and hence contribute to ductile fracture. Circular voids tend to deform into elliptical voids just before their coalescence to form cracks. The principle aim of this study is to investigate the effect of void shape on the micro-mechanism of void growth by using Discrete Dislocation Plasticity simulations. For voided crystals, conventional DDP produces a continuous slip step throughout the material even if a dislocation escapes from a non-convex domain. To overcome this issue, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is used here to incorporate the displacement discontinuity. Different aspect ratios of elliptical voids are considered under uniaxial and biaxial deformation boundary conditions. The results suggest that voids having the largest surface area tend to have maximum growth rate as compared to void with lower surface area, i.e. "larger is faster". Under biaxial loading, a higher magnitude of strain hardening, and void growth rate are observed as compared to uniaxial loading. The results also suggest that the orientation of slip planes as well as voids, affect the overall plastic behavior of the voided-ductile material. Furthermore, circular void tends to induce minimum growth rate but have the maximum strain hardening effect as compared to other void shapes under both loading conditions. The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of ductile fracture with applications in manufacturing industry, aerospace industry and in the design of nano/micro-electromechanical devices i.e. NEMS/MEMS.</p>

            <p>For their resilience and toughness, filamentous entanglements are ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems across length scales, from polymer-chain- to collagen-networks and from cable-net structures to forest canopies. Textiles are an everyday manifestation of filamentous entanglement: the remarkable resilience and toughness in knitted fabrics arise predominately from the topology of interlooped yarns. Yet most architected materials do not exploit entanglement as a design primitive, and industrial knitting fixes a narrow set of patterns for manufacturability. Additive manufacturing has recently enabled interlocking structures such as chainmail, knot and woven assemblies, hinting at broader possibilities for entangled architectures. The general challenge is to treat knitting itself as a three-dimensional architected material with predictable and tunable mechanics across scales. Here, we show that knitted architectures fabricated additively can be recast as periodic entangled solids whose responses are both fabric-like and programmable. We reproduce the characteristic behavior of conventional planar knits and extend knitting into the third dimension by interlooping along three orthogonal directions, yielding volumetric knits whose stiffness and dissipation are tuned by prescribed pre-strain. We propose a simple scaling that unifies the responses across stitch geometries and constituent materials. Further, we realize the same topology from centimeter to micrometer scales, culminating in the fabrication of what is, to our knowledge, the smallest knitted structure ever made. By demonstrating 3D-printed knits can be interpreted both as a traditional fabric, as well as a novel architected material with defined periodicity, this work establishes the dual nature of entangled filaments and paves the way towards a new form of material architectures with high degrees of entanglement.</p>

The system approaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with long-range interactions induced by the simultaneous resetting.

Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also discuss a possible experimental realisation of this resetting gas using optical traps.</p>

            <h2>Classical uncertainty relations and entropy production in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, Luca Peliti</p>
            <p>We analyze Fürth's 1933 classical uncertainty relations in the modern language of stochastic differential equations. Our interest is motivated by applications to non-equilibrium classical statistical mechanics. We show that Fürth's uncertainty relations are a property enjoyed by martingales under the measure of a diffusion process. This result implies a lower bound on fluctuations in current velocities of entropic quantifiers of transitions in stochastic thermodynamics. In cases of particular interest, we recover an inequality well known in optimal mass transport relating the mean kinetic energy of the current velocity and the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the probability distributions of the entropy. In performing our analysis, we also avail us of an unpublished argument due to Krzysztof Gawȩdzki to derive a lower bound to the entropy production by transition described by Langevin-Kramers process in terms of the squared quadratic Wasserstein distance between the initial and final states of the transition. Finally, we illustrate how Fürth's relations admit a straightforward extension to piecewise deterministic processes. We thus show that the results in the paper concern properties enjoyed by general Markov processes.</p>

            <h2>Full Counting Statistics of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov Bound States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Christian Ohnmacht, Wolfgang Belzig, Juan Carlos Cuevas</p>
            <p>With the help of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) it has become possible to address single magnetic impurities on superconducting surfaces and to investigate the peculiar properties of the in-gap states known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. However, until very recently YSR states were only investigated with conventional tunneling spectroscopy, missing the crucial information contained in other transport properties such as shot noise. Here, we adapt the concept of full counting statistics (FCS) to provide a very deep insight into the spin-dependent transport in these hybrid systems. We illustrate the power of FCS by analyzing different situations in which YSR states show up including single-impurity junctions, as well as double-impurity systems where one can probe the tunneling between individual YSR states. The FCS concept allows us to unambiguously identify every tunneling process that plays a role in these situations. Moreover, FCS provides all the relevant transport properties, including current, shot noise and all the cumulants of the current distribution. Our approach can reproduce the experimental results recently reported on the shot noise of a single-impurity junction with a normal STM tip. We also predict the signatures of resonant (and non-resonant) multiple Andreev reflections in the shot noise of single-impurity junctions with two superconducting electrodes. In the case of double-impurity junctions we show that the direct tunneling between YSR states is characterized by a strong reduction of the Fano factor that reaches a minimum value of 7/32, a new fundamental result in quantum transport. The FCS approach presented here can be naturally extended to investigate the spin-dependent superconducting transport in a variety of situations, and it is also suitable to analyze multi-terminal superconducting junctions, irradiated contacts, and many other basic situations.</p>

            <h2>Fermi Surface Bosonization for Non-Fermi Liquids</h2>

            <p>Understanding non-Fermi liquids in dimensions higher than one remains one of the most formidable challenges in modern condensed matter physics. These systems, characterized by an abundance of gapless degrees of freedom and the absence of well-defined quasiparticles, defy conventional analytical frameworks. Inspired by recent work [Delacretaz, Du, Mehta, and Son, Physical Review Research, 4, 033131 (2022)], we present a procedure for bosonizing Fermi surfaces that does not rely on the existence of sharp excitation and is thus directly applicable to non-Fermi liquids. Our method involves parameterizing the generalized fermionic distribution function through a bosonic field that describes frequency-dependent local variations of the chemical potential in momentum space. We propose an effective action that produces the collisionless quantum Boltzmann equation as its equation of motion and can be used for any dimension and Fermi surface of interest. Even at the quadratic order, this action reproduces non-trivial results obtainable only through involved analysis with alternative means. By offering an alternative method directly applicable to studying the low-energy physics of Fermi and non-Fermi liquids, our work potentially stands as an important building block in advancing the comprehension of strange metals and associated phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Roughness and critical force for depinning at 3-loop order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikhail N. Semeikin, Kay Joerg Wiese</p>
            <p>A $d$-dimensional elastic manifold at depinning is described by a renormalized field theory, based on the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG). Here we analyze this theory to 3-loop order, equivalent to third order in $\epsilon=4-d$, where $d$ is the internal dimension. The critical exponent reads $\zeta = \frac \epsilon3 + 0.04777 \epsilon^2 -0.068354 \epsilon^3 + {\cal O}(\epsilon^4)$. Using that $\zeta(d=0)=2^-$, we estimate $\zeta(d=1)=1.266(20)$, $\zeta(d=2)=0.752(1)$ and $\zeta(d=3)=0.357(1)$. For Gaussian disorder, the pinning force per site is estimated as $f_{\rm c}= {\cal B} m^{2}\rho_m + f_{\rm c}^0$, where $m^2$ is the strength of the confining potential, $\cal B$ a universal amplitude, $\rho_m$ the correlation length of the disorder, and $f_{\rm c}^0$ a non-universal lattice dependent term. For charge-density waves, we find a mapping to the standard $\phi^4$-theory with $O(n)$ symmetry in the limit of $n\to -2$. This gives $f_{\rm c} = \tilde {\cal A}(d) m^2 \ln (m) + f_{\rm c}^0 $, with $\tilde {\cal A}(d) = -\partial_n \big[\nu(d,n)^{-1}+\eta(d,n)\big]_{n=-2}$, reminiscent of log-CFTs.</p>

The result is owing to the fact that the instantaneous eigenstates approach is applicable in more wide parameter range compared with the time-independent effective Hamiltonian approach. Analysis from the results of quantum master equation shows that the insulator effect is originated from coherent localization of atom wave packets in optical wells.</p>

            <p>Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</p>

            <p>The pairing mechanism behind the monolayer FeSe is one essential question for iron-based superconductors. In this work, we show the sublattice degree of freedoms of monolayer FeSe plays a special role in its pairing properties, namely the sublattice dichotomy. The high-quality monolayer FeSe samples with atomic flat $1\times1$ topography on the SrTiO$_3$(001) substrates are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By comparing the tunneling spectra at $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fe sublattices, we find the coherence peak of $\alpha$-Fe at the inner gap $+V_i$ is higher than $\beta$-Fe while the coherence peak of $\beta$-Fe at $-V_i$ is higher than $\alpha$-Fe with a similar amount. We also observed a reversed effect at the outer gap $\pm V_o$. We propose the $\eta$-pairing mechanism between $k$ and $-k+Q$ is the key mechanism for this unconventional sublattice dichotomy effect.</p>

            <p>In multilayer graphene, the stacking order of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity. By applying shear stress, it is possible to induce sliding between different layers, altering the stacking order. Here, focusing on bilayer graphene, we analyze how ionic fluctuations alter the free energy barrier between different stacking equilibria. We calculate the free energy barrier through the state-of-the-art self-consistent harmonic approximation, which can be evaluated at unstable configurations. We find that above 100 K there is a large reduction of the barrier of more than 30% due to thermal vibrations, which significantly improves the agreement between previous first-principles theoretical work and experiments in a single graphite crystal. As the temperature increases, the barrier remains nearly constant up to around 500 K, with a more pronounced decrease only at higher temperatures. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</p>

            <p>Bipolaronic superconductivity is an exotic pairing mechanism proposed for materials like Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ (BKBO); however, conclusive experimental evidence for a (bi)polaron metallic state in this material remains elusive. Here, we combine resonant inelastic x-ray and neutron total scattering techniques with advanced modelling to study the local lattice distortions, electronic structure, and electron-phonon coupling ($e$-ph) in BKBO as a function of doping. Data for the parent compound ($x = 0$) indicates that the electronic gap opens in predominantly oxygen-derived states strongly coupled to a long-range ordered breathing distortion of the oxygen sublattice. Upon doping, short-range breathing distortions and sizable ($e$-ph) coupling persist into the superconducting regime ($x = 0.4$). Comparisons with exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations further support this conclusion. Our results provide compelling evidence that BKBO's metallic phase hosts a liquid of small (bi)polarons derived from local breathing distortions of the lattice, with implications for understanding the low-temperature superconducting instability</p>

            <p>Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raisa Fabiha, Patrick J. Taylor, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay</p>
            <p>Antennas are the quintessential means to communicate information wirelessly over long distances via electromagnetic waves. Traditional antennas have two shortcomings that have prevented miniaturization: (1) their radiation efficiencies plummet and (2) they radiate isotropically when miniaturized to small fractions of the radiated wavelength. Here, we report a new genre of non-classical antennas that overcome these limitations by employing non-traditional principles and harnessing topological insulators. An alternating charge current of frequency 1-10 GHz injected into a thin film of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) injects a spin current of alternating spin polarization into a periodic array of cobalt nanomagnets deposited on the surface of the 3D-TI. This generates spin waves in the nanomagnets, which radiate electromagnetic waves in space, thereby implementing an antenna. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is the same as that of the current. The antenna dimension is only 0.6-1.8% of the free space wavelength and yet it radiates with an efficiency several orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical limit for conventional antennas. Furthermore, it radiates anisotropically (despite being a "point source") and one can change the anisotropic radiation pattern by changing the direction of the injected alternating charge current, which changes the spin wave patterns within the nanomagnets because of spin-momentum locking in the 3D-TI. This enables beam steering without the use of a phased array. We have overcome several limitations of classical antennas by harnessing the quantum mechanical attributes of a quantum material, namely a 3D-TI.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yutaro Tanaka, Daichi Nakamura, Ryo Okugawa, Kohei Kawabata</p>
            <p>Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases protected by reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Electron-Ion Coupling Breaks Energy Symmetry in Bistable Organic Electrochemical Transistors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lukas M. Bongartz, Garrett LeCroy, Tyler J. Quill, Nicholas Siemons, Gerwin Dijk, Adam Marks, Christina Cheng, Hans Kleemann, Karl Leo, Alberto Salleo</p>
            <p>Organic electrochemical transistors are extensively studied for applications ranging from bioelectronics to analog and neuromorphic computing. Despite significant advances, the fundamental interactions between the polymer semiconductor channel and the electrolyte, which critically determine the device performance, remain underexplored. Here, we examine the coupling between the benchmark semiconductor PEDOT:PSS and an ionic liquid to explain the bistable and non-volatile behavior observed in OECTs. Using X-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate how the electrolyte modifies the channel composition, enhances molecular order, and reshapes the energetic landscape. Notably, the observed bistability arises from asymmetric and path-dependent energetics during doping and dedoping, resulting in two distinct paths, driven by a direct interaction between the electronic and ionic charge carriers. These findings highlight the electrolyte's role in tuning charge carrier dynamics, positioning it as a powerful yet underutilized lever for enabling novel device functionalities.</p>

            <h2>Melting Points and Formation Free Energies of Carbon Compounds with Sodalite Structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuhiro Sano, Kenshin Nato</p>
            <p>Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the melting temperatures $T_{\rm m}$ and formation free energy of carbon compounds with sodalite structures, $X$C$ _6$, $X$C$ _{10}$, and $X$C$ _{12}$, where $X$ is F, Na, Cl, and so on. These compounds are expected to be phonon-mediated superconductors exhibiting high transition temperatures $T_{\rm c}$ of up to about 100 K. We estimate $T_{\rm m}$ as a function of pressure $P$ by using the first-principles molecular dynamics method and show the results as phase diagrams on the $P$-$T$ plane together with the results of $T_{\rm c}$. It indicates that the $T_{\rm m}$ of NaC$_{\rm 6}$, which has a $T_{\rm c}$ up to about 100 K, is about $1300$ K or more at $P=30$ GPa. Furthermore, the $T_{\rm m}$ of FC$_{\rm 6}$ is about 2200 K even at $P=0$ GPa, where its $T_{\rm c}$ is about 80 K. Similar results are obtained for FC$_{\rm 10}$ and ClC$_{\rm 10}$ systems. These results suggest that some compounds can stably exist as high-temperature superconductors even at room temperature and pressure. To examine the feasibility of synthesizing these compounds, we estimate the formation enthalpies and formation free energies. These results suggest that NaC$_6$ could be formed under a sufficiently high pressure of about 300 GPa and a high temperature of about 6500 K.</p>

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</p>

            <h2>In situ vs ex situ: Comparing the structure of PNIPAM microgels at the air/water and air/solid interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hayden Robertson, Joanne Zimmer, Anuar Sifuentes Name, Cassia Lux, Sebastian Stock, Regine von Klitzing, Olaf Soltwedel</p>
            <p>For studying the structure of microgel particles at the air/water interface, specular and off-specular X-ray reflectivity (OSR/XRR) allows in situ measurements without any labelling techniques. Herein we investigate the vertical and lateral structure of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels (MGs) at the air/water interface and the effect of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer onto solid substrates. The initial ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans of LB-transferred MGs at the air/solid interface reveal strong lateral 2D hexagonal ordering across a broad range of lateral surface pressures at the air/water interface before LB-transfer. Notably, for the first time, these results were confirmed by OSR, demonstrating the existence of the long-range hexagonal ordering at low and intermediate surface pressures. For in situ conditions and upon uniaxial compression at the air/water interface, the MG lattice constant decreases non-monotonically. This indicates the formation of domains at low pressures that approach each other and only compress when the surface isotherm reaches a plateau. Comparing the results of in situ and ex situ measurements, our study demonstrates a clear transfer effect during the LB-deposition on the lateral ordering of the MGs: the distance between the particles decreased during LB-transfer, and at high pressures ($\Pi\,>\,17\,\mathrm{mNm^{-1}}$) a second distance occurs indicating small domains with hexagonal internal ordering. The novel surface characterisation approaches debuted here highlight the use of both XRR and OSR to probe the vertical and lateral structure of adsorbed MGs, offering in situ, non-invasive insights without the need for doping or transfer-induced artefacts.</p>

            <h2>Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Pal Singh, Luigi Amico, Ludwig Mathey</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is encoded in a specific microscopic pattern of density waves and phase excitations that can be addressed within the experimental cold atoms capabilities. This work paves the way for tunable amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing. At the same time, our analysis provides the microscopic explanation of the general notion of parametric amplification occurring in nonlinear coherent devices.</p>

            <h2>Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazi Ranjibul Islam, Aditya Savanur, Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau-damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs) for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focused on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs as well, which, however, turn out to have no effect on the solutions. Decomposing the master equation into angular-momentum ($\ell$) channels, the emergent modes are of two types: Fermi-surface deformations with discrete spectra and particle-hole excitations forming a continuous band. The long-lived zero-sound mode, which corresponds to $\ell = 0$, is found to be robust against damping effects. Intriguingly, we have an infinite family of discrete modes corresponding to higher-order harmonics of the net deformation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gustavo A. L. Forão, Fernando S. Filho, Pedro V. Paraguassú</p>
            <p>Collisional Brownian engines have attracted significant attention due to their simplicity, experimental accessibility, and amenability to exact analytical solutions. While previous research has predominantly focused on optimizing mean values of power and efficiency, the joint statistical properties of these performance metrics remain largely unexplored. Using stochastic thermodynamics, we investigate the joint probability distributions of power and efficiency for collisional Brownian engines, revealing how thermodynamic fluctuations influence the probability of observing values exceeding their respective mean maxima. Our conditional probability analysis demonstrates that when power fluctuates above its maximum mean value, the probability of achieving high efficiency increases substantially, suggesting fluctuation regimes where the classical power-efficiency trade-off can be probabilistically overcome. Notably, our framework extends to a broader class of engines, as the essential features of the statistics of the system are fully determined by the Onsager coefficients. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of fluctuations in Brownian engines, highlighting how stochastic behavior can enable performance beyond traditional thermodynamic bounds.</p>

            <h2>Self-consistency error correction for accurate machine learning potentials from variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Tenti, Kousuke Nakano, Michele Casula</p>
            <p>Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) can be used to train accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials on time scales and for system sizes previously unattainable. VMC training sets are often based on partially optimized wave functions (WFs) to circumvent expensive energy optimizations of the whole set of WF parameters. However, frozen variational parameters lead to VMC forces and pressures not consistent with the underlying potential energy surface, a bias called the self-consistency error (SCE). Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the accuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test case. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109, 205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a Jastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The MLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can approach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs. Our conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs trained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical observables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended high-quality training sets with VMC.</p>

            <p>The correlation properties of nonaffine elastic response in strongly disordered materials are investigated using the theory of correlated random matrices and numerical models. The random matrix theory shows that the divergence of the nonaffine displacement field has large-scale exponentially decaying correlations. The corresponding length scale $\xi$ is determined by the strength of the disorder and can be indefinitely large, significantly exceeding the correlation length of the disorder. The rotor of the nonaffine displacement field has the same length scale $\xi$ except the case of the volumetric deformation. The main theoretical dependencies are confirmed by the numerical investigation of the rigidity percolation model and the molecular dynamics simulations of a model polystyrene in the amorphous state.</p>

We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations - strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Rusconi, Christina Schenk, Razvan Ceuca, Arghir Zarnescu, Elena Akhmatskaya</p>
            <p>The description of complex physical phenomena often involves sophisticated models that rely on a large number of parameters, with many dimensions and scales. One practical way to simplify that kind of models is to discard some of the parameters, or terms of underlying equations, thus giving rise to reduced models. Here, we propose a general approach to obtaining such reduced models. The method is independent of the model in use, i.e., equation-free, depends only on the interplay between the scales and dimensions involved in the description of the phenomena, and controls over-parametrization. It also quantifies conditions for asymptotic models by providing explicitly computable thresholds on values of parameters that allow for reducing complexity of a model, while preserving essential predictive properties. Although our focus is on complexity reduction, this approach may also help with calibration by mitigating the risks of over-parameterization and instability in parameter estimation. The benefits of this approach are discussed in the context of the classical projectile model.</p>

            <p>We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and average local density of states (Average-LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</p>

            <p>Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</p>

From a physical point of view, this term may mimic a ferromagnetic order that arises naturally when couplings beyond the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction are taken into account.</p>

            <p>We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors $N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for $N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f > N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly, we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.</p>

            <p>We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet on a square lattice. Our study reveals that the propagation of spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior, i.e., spin waves traveling in opposite directions display asymmetry in energy dispersion $\omega({\bf q}) \ne \omega(-{\bf q)}$, which also results in an asymmetric behavior of group velocity, spin stiffness, etc. We find that this asymmetric behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned inside the atomic plane, while the excitations remain symmetric for out-of-plane magnetization. The first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</p>

With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</p>

            <h2>Excess dissipation shapes symmetry breaking in non-equilibrium currents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo Sireci, Luca Peliti, Daniel Maria Busiello</p>
            <p>Most natural thermodynamic systems operate far from equilibrium, developing persistent currents and organizing into non-equilibrium stationary states (NESSs). Yet, the principles by which such systems self-organize, breaking equilibrium symmetries under external and internal constraints, remain unclear. Here, we establish a general connection between symmetry breaking and dissipation in mesoscopic stochastic systems described by Langevin dynamics. Using a geometric framework based on the inverse diffusion matrix, we decompose the velocity field into excess (gradient) and housekeeping (residual) components. This provides a natural entropy production split: the excess part captures internal reorganization under non-equilibrium conditions, while the housekeeping part quantifies detailed-balance violation due to external forces. We derive an exact equality linking the two, along with an inequality identifying accessible thermodynamics. A weak-noise expansion of the stationary solution reveals the general geometry of the NESS velocity field, enabling a unified classification of steady states. We apply this framework to systems ranging from molecular machines to coupled oscillators, showing how symmetry breaking in trajectory space constrains NESS organization. We further extend our approach to systems with multiplicative noise, deriving how additional symmetry breaking relates to curved (space-dependent) metrics. Finally, we show that both the NESS velocity field and stationary distribution can be derived through variational functionals based on excess dissipation. This work sheds light on the intimate connection between geometric features, dissipative properties, and symmetry breaking, uncovering a classification of NESSs that reflects how emergent organization reflects physical non-equilibrium conditions.</p>

Energy can be stored elastically within grain interiors and dissipated by a variety of different mechanisms. One such dissipation mechanism is diffusionally-accommodated/-assisted grain boundary sliding, also known as transient diffusion creep. Here we detail a simple reference model of transient diffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes: a regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic behaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised extended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and as an Andrade model at high frequencies. The parametrisation has a specific relaxation strength, Andrade exponent and Andrade time. The Andrade exponent depends only on the angles at which grains meet at triple junctions, and can be related to the exponents of stress singularities that occur at triple junctions in purely elastic models without diffusion. A comparison with laboratory experiments shows that the simple models here provide a lower bound on the observed attenuation. However, there are also clearly additional dissipative processes occurring in laboratory experiments that are not described by these simple models.</p>

            <h2>Mass-gap description of heavy impurities in Fermi gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Eugen Dizer, Emilio Ramos Rodríguez, Richard Schmidt</p>
            <p>We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition is absent.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Metal Cation on Chiral Properties of 2D Halide Perovskites</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mike Pols, Helena Boom, Geert Brocks, Sofía Calero, Shuxia Tao</p>
            <p>Chiral two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites are formed by embedding chiral organic cations in a perovskite crystal structure. The chirality arises from distortions of the 2D metal halide layers induced by the packing of these organic cations. Sn-based octahedra spontaneously distort, but it remains unclear whether this intrinsic structural instability enhances the chirality. We investigate the effect of the metal cation on structural and phonon chirality in MBA$_{2}$Sn$_{\mathrm{x}}$Pb$_{1-\mathrm{x}}$I$_{4}$ (x = 0, 1/2, and 1). Incorporating Sn does distort the metal halide octehedra, yet it only has a minor impact on the structural chirality. In contrast, the phonons in MBA$_{2}$SnI$_{4}$ are substantially more chiral than in MBA$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$, especially the in-plane acoustic modes. However, this enhanced phonon chirality does not lead to a generation of a larger angular momentum under a temperature gradient, because the contributions of different chiral phonons tend to compensate one another.</p>

            <p>Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum properties of magnons to advance nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material typically grown as thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) for lattice matching. However, paramagnetic GGG introduces detrimental damping at low temperatures due to substrate magnetization, undermining quantum applications. Here, we study magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film on a yttrium scandium gallium aluminum garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy down to 30$\,$mK, we compare YIG/YSGAG with a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. We demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low damping from 300$\,$K to 30$\,$mK, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$ at room temperature, comparable to the best YIG/GGG films and bulk YIG, with no low-temperature upturn. The diamagnetic substrate eliminates the dissipation mechanisms that dominate on magnetized GGG, preserving low magnetic damping across the full temperature range. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyemin Kim, Hyungseok Kim, Taeyong Kim</p>
            <p>Understanding and manipulating nanoscale energy transport and conversion processes are essential for diverse applications, ranging from thermoelectrics and energy harvesting to thermal management of microelectronics. While it has long been recognized that acoustic and thermal properties in condensed matters are primarily due to microscopic transport of phonons as quasiparticles, probing thermal acoustic excitations particularly at sub-THz remains a challenge primarily due to limitations in experimental techniques with spatiotemporal resolutions pertinent to probing them. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) and its variant, impulsive stimulated Brillouin scattering (ISS), provide access to these thermal acoustic excitations, enabling measurement of quantities such as acoustic dispersions along with relaxation dynamics occurring in ultrasonic as well as hypersonic frequencies. In this perspective, we provide a brief overview of the operational principles of BLS and ISS, and highlight their applications in probing acoustic, thermal, and magnetic excitations in emerging and low-dimensional materials. We conclude by discussing current challenges and future opportunities for advanced material characterization using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Longwen Zhou, Rujia Jing, Shenlin Wu</p>
            <p>Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</p>

The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rushik Desai, Junyeong Ahn, Alejandro Strachan, Arun Mannodi-Kanakkithodi</p>
            <p>Among emerging energy materials, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have garnered significant attention over the last decade owing to the abundance of their constituent species, low manufacturing costs, and their highly tunable composition-structure-property space. Navigating the vast perovskite compositional landscape is possible using density functional theory (DFT) computations, but they are not easily extended to predictions of the synthesizability of new materials and their properties. As a result, only a limited number of compositions identified to have desirable optoelectronic properties from these calculations have been realized experimentally. One way to bridge this gap is by learning from the experimental literature about how the perovskite composition-structure space relates to their likelihood of laboratory synthesis. Here, we present our efforts in combining high-throughput DFT data with experimental labels collected from the literature to train classifier models employing various materials descriptors to forecast the synthesizability of any given perovskite compound. Our framework utilizes the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning strategy and makes probabilistic estimates of the synthesis likelihood based on DFT- computed energies and the prior existence of similar synthesized compounds. Our data and models can be readily accessed via a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) nanoHUB tool.</p>

            <p>This article describes an extension to the effective Average Atom (AA) method for random alloys to account for local ordering (short-range order) effects by utilizing information from partial radial distribution functions. The new Local-Order Average Atom (LOAA) method is rigorously derived based on statistical mechanics arguments and validated for non-stoichiometric binary 2D hexagonal crystals and 3D FeNiCr and NiAl alloys whose ground state is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. Material properties for these alloys, and phase transformations for the NiAl system, computed from static and dynamic atomistic simulations using standard interatomic potentials (IPs) exhibit a strong dependence on local ordering that is captured by simulations with effective LOAA IPs, but not the original AA method. The advantage of LOAA is that it requires smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and therefore enables the simulation of complex materials, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the computational cost of standard IPs.</p>

Numerical evidence for a phase transition is found both with and without an externally applied magnetic field. The critical exponents are computed in both cases. We compute with a 10% accuracy the lower critical dimension at zero magnetic field, finding a result consistent with estimates obtained with entirely different methods, by combining our estimates of critical exponents in five dimensions with previous results for other spatial dimensions. When the results in a magnetic field are compared with previous results in six spatial dimensions, qualitative differences emerge in the scaling behavior of the correlation functions at zero external momentum. This anomalous scaling does not extend to other wavevectors. We do not find indications of a quasi first-order phase transition in a magnetic field.</p>

Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance.

            <p>The interplay between charge ordering and its manifestation in macroscopic electrical transport in low-dimensional materials is crucial for understanding resistive switching mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the electronic transport and switching behavior of single-crystalline $\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$, focusing on low-frequency resistance noise dynamics of charge-order-driven resistive switching. Using electrical transport, low frequency noise spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we probe electron dynamics across the Na-ion-ordering (IO) and charge-ordering (CO) transitions. Near room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the noise spectral density points to a dominance of nearest-neighbor polaron hopping. Below IO transition temperature (\( T_{IO} \sim 240 \, \text{K} \)), structural analysis reveals that Na-ions adopt a zig-zag occupancy pattern, breaking the two-fold rotational symmetry and influencing the electronic ground state. Subsequently, a sharp drop in resistance noise below the CO transition temperature (\( T_{CO} \sim 125 \, \text{K} \)) indicates the emergence of correlated electron behavior. Furthermore, application of sufficient electric field leads to the destabilization of the CO state, and a transition to a high-conducting state. The material exhibits distinct resistive switching between 35~K and 110~K, with a resistance change spanning two orders of magnitude, primarily driven by electronic mechanisms rather than Joule heating. These findings provide new insights into charge-order-induced switching and electronic correlations in quasi-one-dimensional systems, with potential applications in cryogenic memory and neuromorphic computing devices owing to the low noise levels in their stable resistive states.</p>

            <h2>Inverse Purcell Suppression of Decoherence in Majorana Qubits via Environmental Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir Toussaint</p>
            <p>We propose a novel approach for optimizing topological quantum devices: instead of merely isolating qubits from environmental noise, we engineer the environment to actively suppress decoherence. For a Majorana qubit in a topological superconducting wire, the exponentially small energy splitting $\epsilon \sim e^{-L/\xi}$ provides protection against local perturbations but renders it highly susceptible to pure dephasing from low-frequency environmental noise. We show that coupling via a parity-conserving operator ($i\gamma_L\gamma_R$) to a bosonic environment yields a dephasing rate $\Gamma_\phi \propto S(\epsilon)$, where $S(\epsilon)$ is the environmental noise power at the qubit splitting frequency. In the experimentally relevant regime where $k_B T \gtrsim \hbar\epsilon$ (with $T \sim 10-100$ mK), the noise power scales as $S(\epsilon) \propto \rho(\epsilon) k_B T/\hbar\epsilon$, leading to a dephasing rate $\Gamma_\phi \propto \rho(\epsilon) T/\epsilon$. This exposes a fundamental challenge: the dephasing rate diverges as $1/\epsilon$ for a standard environment, e.g., a 1D system with linear dispersion where $\rho(\epsilon)$ is constant. We overcome this by designing environments with a suppressed density of states following $\rho_{\text{engineered}}(\epsilon) = \rho_{\text{free}}(\epsilon) (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$. This creates an ``inverse Purcell effect'' that yields a temperature-independent suppression factor $F_P = (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$. For $\alpha > 1$, the engineered dephasing rate decreases exponentially with wire length, $\Gamma_{\phi,\text{engineered}} \propto e^{-(\alpha-1)L/\xi}$, meaning longer wires provide better coherence protection. This provides a quantitative design principle where environmental engineering transforms detrimental noise into a tool for coherence stabilization, while respecting fermion parity superselection rules.</p>

            <p>Phonons have long been thought to be incapable of explaining key phenomena in strange metals, including linear-in-\textit{T} Planckian resistivity from high to very low temperatures. We argue that these conclusions were based on static, perturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and nonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best target for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think about Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and electromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been developing the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of academic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the strange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions playing a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$ resistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the Drude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature resistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity saturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from the Fröhlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all along, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In the course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson localization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a ``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and is more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of ``Planckian speed limit''.</p>

E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain. Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD) distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\alpha), which facilitates a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena.</p>

            <p>Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</p>

We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.</p>

            <p>The study-to-study variability of bedload flux measurements in turbulent sediment transport borders an order of magnitude, even for idealized laboratory conditions. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, empirical methods to account for channel geometry effects in the determination of the transport-driving bed shear stress and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive a universal method of bed shear stress determination. It consists of a physically-based definition of the bed surface and a channel sidewall correction that does not rely on empirical elements, except for well-established scaling coefficients associated with Kolmogórov's theory of turbulence. Application of this method to bedload transport of spherical grains -- to rule out grain shape effects -- collapses data from existing laboratory measurements and grain-resolved CFD-DEM simulations for various channel geometries onto a single curve. In contrast, classical sidewall corrections, as well as an alternative bed surface definition, are unable to universally capture these data, especially those from shallow or very narrow channel flows. We then apply our method to an extended grain-shape-controlled data compilation, complemented by literature data for non-spherical grains and from grain-unresolved CFD-DEM simulations. This compilation covers a very diverse range of transport conditions, ranging from very narrow to infinitely wide channels, from shallow to deep channel flows, from mild to steep bed slopes, and from weak to intense transport. We generalize an existing physical bedload flux model to account for grain shape variability and show that it explains almost all the compiled data within a factor of only $1.3$.</p>

We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paweł Matus, Rajesh Biswas, Piotr Surówka, Francisco Peña-Benítez</p>
            <p>This paper explores the application of Newton-Cartan geometry to the kinetic theory of gases that includes non-relativistic gravitational effects and the principle of general covariance. Starting with an introduction to the basics of Newton-Cartan geometry, we examine the motion of point particles within this framework, leading to a detailed analysis of kinetic theory and the derivation of conservation equations. The equilibrium distribution function is explored, and the example of a rotating gas in a gravitational field is discussed. Further, we develop covariant hydrodynamic equations and extend our analysis through a gradient expansion approach to assess first-order constitutive relations for rotating gases. Finally, we address the frame-dependence paradox, presenting a novel resolution that addresses apparent discrepancies. Our construction resolves a fifty-year-old debate about the frame-indifferent formulation of kinetic theory. The resolution is presented in a modern, symmetry-based approach.</p>

            <p>We consider a composite defect system where a lower-dimensional defect (sub-defect) is embedded to a higher-dimensional one, and examine renormalization group (RG) flows localized on the defect. A composite defect is constructed in the $(3-\epsilon)$-dimensional free $\text{O}(N)$ vector model with line and surface interactions by triggering localized RG flows to non-trivial IR fixed points. Focusing on the case where the symmetry group $\text{O}(N)$ is broken to a subgroup $\text{O}(m)\times\text{O}(N-m)$ on the line defect, there is an $\text{O}(N)$ symmetric fixed point for all $N$, while two additional $\text{O}(N)$ symmetry breaking ones appear for $N\ge 23$. We also examine a $\mathcal{C}$-theorem for localized RG flows along the sub-defect and show that the $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds in our model by perturbative calculations.</p>

            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are changing atomistic simulations in the field of chemistry and materials science. However, constructing a single universal MLIP that can accurately model molecular and crystalline systems remains challenging. A central obstacle is the integration of diverse datasets generated under different computational conditions. We present Total Energy Alignment (TEA), which is an approach that enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous quantum chemical datasets without redundant calculations. Using TEA, we trained MACE-Osaka24, the first open-source MLIP model based on a unified dataset covering molecular and crystalline systems. This universal model displays strong performances across diverse chemical systems, exhibiting similar or improved accuracies in predicting organic reaction barriers compared to those of specialized models, while effectively maintaining state-of-the-art accuracies for inorganic systems. These advancements pave the way for accelerated discoveries in the fields of chemistry and materials science via genuine foundation models for chemistry.</p>

            <p>Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages quantum systems to perform complex computational tasks with exceptional efficiency and reduced energy consumption. We introduce a minimalistic QRC framework utilizing as few as five atoms in a single-mode optical cavity, combined with continuous quantum measurement. The system is conveniently scalable, as newly added atoms naturally couple with existing ones via the shared cavity field. To achieve high computational expressivity with a minimal reservoir, we include two critical elements: reservoir feedback and polynomial regression. Reservoir feedback modifies the reservoir's dynamics without altering its internal quantum hardware, while polynomial regression nonlinearly enhances output resolution. We demonstrate significant QRC performance in memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks: predicting chaotic time-series data via the Mackey-Glass task and classifying sine-square waveforms. This framework fulfills QRC's objectives to minimize hardware size and energy consumption, marking a significant advancement in integrating quantum physics with machine learning technology.</p>

            <p>We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system and are applicable to both near-term and large-scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Isaac Chuang</p>
            <p>With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</p>

            <h2>Probing forced responses and causality in data-driven climate emulators: conceptual limitations and the role of reduced-order models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca</p>
            <p>A central challenge in climate science and applied mathematics is developing data-driven models of multiscale systems that capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. Current neural climate emulators aim to resolve the atmosphere-ocean system in all its complexity but often fail to reproduce forced responses, limiting their use in causal studies such as Green's function experiments. To investigate the origin of these limitations, we first focus on a simplified dynamical system that retains key features of climate variability. We interpret the results through linear response theory, providing a rigorous framework to evaluate neural models beyond stationary statistics and probe causal mechanisms. We argue that the ability of multiscale systems' emulators to reproduce perturbed statistics depends critically on (i) identifying an appropriate coarse-grained representation and (ii) careful parameterizations of unresolved processes. For low-frequency climate dynamics, these insights highlight reduced-order models, tailored to specific processes and scales, as valuable alternatives to general-purpose emulators. We next consider a real-world application, developing a neural model to investigate the joint variability of the surface temperature field and radiative fluxes. The model infers a multiplicative noise process directly from data, largely reproduces the system's probability distribution, and enables causal studies through forced responses. We discuss its limitations and outline directions for future work. These results expose fundamental challenges in data-driven modeling of multiscale physical systems and underscore the value of coarse-grained, stochastic approaches, with response theory as a principled framework to guide model design.</p>

            <p>We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</p>

By combining biophysical arguments and dimensional analysis, we show that vital properties of chemical self-replicators, such as growth yield, minimum doubling time, and minimum power consumption in dormancy, can be quantitatively estimated using fundamental physical constants. The calculations highlight how the laws of physics constrain chemistry-based life on Earth, and if it exists, elsewhere in our universe.</p>

Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schrödinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Going beyond Landauer: Information-cost relations from inference based on the maximum entropy principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanyuan Xiao, Jian-Hua Jiang, Junjie Liu</p>
            <p>The Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of information thermodynamics, provides a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of information erasure in terms of the information content change. However, its traditional formulation is largely confined to systems exchanging solely energy with an ideal thermal bath. In this work, we derive general information-cost trade-off relations that go beyond the scope of Landauer's principle by developing a thermodynamic inference approach based on the maximum entropy principle. These relations require only information about the system and are applicable to complex quantum scenarios involving multiple conserved charges and non-thermal environments. Specifically, we present two key results: (i) In scenarios where only the mean values of observables are accessible, we derive an information-content-informed upper bound on the thermodynamic cost which complements an existing generalized Landauer lower bound. (ii) When second-order fluctuations can also be measured, we obtain an information-content-informed lower bound on the change in variances of observables, thereby extending the Landauer's principle to constrain higher-order fluctuation costs. We numerically validate our information-cost trade-off relations using a coupled-qubit system exchanging energy and excitations, a driven qubit implementing an information erasure process, and a driven double quantum dot system that can operate as an inelastic heat engine. Our results underscore the broad utility of maximum-entropy inference in constraining thermodynamic costs for generic finite-time quantum processes, with direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamic applications.</p>

            <p>We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</p>

Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$.

            <p>We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a space like singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.</p>

The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor. The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.</p>

The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</p>

In this work, we propose a ferroelectric mechanism to switch the chirality of Weyl phonons, where the reversal of ferroelectric polarization is intrinsically coupled to a simultaneous reversal of the chirality of Weyl points. This enables electric-field-driven control over the topological properties of phonon excitations. Through a comprehensive symmetry analysis of polar space groups, we identify 27 groups capable of hosting symmetry-protected Weyl phonons with chiral charges $C = 1$, $2$, and $3$, whose chirality can be reversed via polarization switching. The first-principles calculations are performed to screen feasible material candidates for each type of chirality, yielding a set of prototypical ferroelectric compounds that realize the proposed mechanism. As a representative example, K$_2$ZnBr$_4$ hosts the minimal configuration of two pairs of Weyl phonons. Upon polarization reversal, the chirality of all Weyl points is inverted, accompanied by a reversal of associated topological features such as Berry curvature and surface arcs. These findings provide a viable pathway for dynamic, electrical control of topological band crossings and open new avenues for chirality-based phononic applications.</p>

            <h2>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiyuan Wang</p>
            <p>We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Electron-phonon coupling of one-dimensional (3,0) carbon nanotube</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenfeng Ouyang, Jing Jiang, Jian-Feng Zhang, Miao Gao, Kai Liu, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>A very recent report claims that ambient-pressure high-temperature ($T_c$) superconductivity was found in boron-doped three-dimensional networks of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Here, we systematically study the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of one-dimensional (1D) (3,0) CNT under ambient pressure. Our results show that the EPC constant $\lambda$ of the undoped 1D (3,0) CNT is 0.70, and reduces to 0.44 after 1.3 holes/cell doping. Further calculations show that the undoped (3,0) CNT is a two-gap superconductor with a superconducting $T_c$ $\sim$ 33 K under ambient pressure. Additionally, we identify three characteristic phonon modes with strong EPC, establishing that the pristine (3,0) CNT is a high-$T_c$ superconducting unit, and further suggest that searching for those superconducting units with strong EPC phonon mode would be an effective way to discover high-$T_c$ phonon-mediated superconductors. Our study not only provide a crucial and timely theoretical reference for the recent report regarding superconducting CNTs, but also uncover that the pristine (3,0) CNT hosts the highest record of superconducting $T_c$ among the elemental superconductors under ambient pressure.</p>

            <h2>Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa</p>
            <p>In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of the Schmid-Higgs Mode in $d$-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Awelewa, Maxim Dzero</p>
            <p>We study the dynamics of the longitudinal collective mode in an unconventional superconductor. For concreteness, we assume that the superconductor is described by a $d$-wave order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry. After the superconductor has been suddenly subjected to a perturbation at time $t=0$, the order parameter exhibits a peculiar oscillatory behavior, with the amplitude of the oscillations slowly decaying with time in a power-law fashion. Assuming that the initial perturbation is weak, we use a formalism based on quasi-classical approach to superconductivity to determine both the frequency of the oscillations as well as how fast these oscillations decay with time by evaluating the time dependence of the pairing susceptibility. We find that the frequency of the oscillations is given by twice the value of the pairing amplitude in the anti-nodal direction and its amplitude decays as $1/t^2$. The results are also verified by a direct calculation of the order parameter dynamics by numerically solving the equations of motion for the Anderson pseudospins.</p>

            <p>We present a theory for the spin fluctuation spectrum of the hole-doped cuprates in a ground state with period 4 unidirectional charge density wave (`stripe') order. Motivated by recent experimental evidence for a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the `hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed by neutron or X-ray scattering.</p>

            <h2>Unconventional quantization of 2D plasmons in cavities formed by gate slots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilia Moiseenko, Olga Polischuk, Viacheslav Muravev, Dmitry Svintsov</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition $L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the metal edges.</p>

            <p>Even in the quantum limit, non-equilibrium quasiparticle (QP) populations induce QP poisoning that irreversibly relaxes the quantum state and significantly degrades the coherence of transmon qubits. A particularly detrimental yet previously unexplored mechanism arises from QP multiplication facilitated by vortex trapping in superconducting quantum circuits, where a high-energy QP relaxes by breaking additional Cooper pairs and amplifying the QP population due to the locally reduced excitation gap and enhanced quantum confinement within the vortex core. Here we directly resolve this elusive QP multiplication process by revealing vortex-controlled QP self-generation in a highly nonequilibrium regime preceding the phonon bottleneck of QP relaxation. At sufficiently low fluence, femtosecond-resolved magneto-reflection spectroscopy directly reveals a continuously increasing QP population that is strongly dependent on magnetic-field-tuned vortex density and absent at higher excitation fluences. Quantitative analysis of the emergent QP pre-bottleneck dynamics further reveals that, although the phonon population saturates within $\simeq$10~ps, both free and trapped QPs continue to grow in a self-sustained manner--hallmarks of the long-anticipated QP-vortex interactions in nonequilibrium superconductivity. We estimate a substantial increase of $\sim$34\% in QP density at vortex densities of $\sim$ 100 magnetic flux quanta per $\mathrm{\mu m^{2}}$. Our findings establish a powerful spectroscopic tool for uncovering QP multiplication and reveal vortex-assisted QP relaxation as a critical materials bottleneck whose mitigation will be essential for resolving QP poisoning and enhancing coherence in superconducting qubits.</p>

            <p>Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and non-Abelian physics.</p>

            <p>Light polarization is one of the most fundamental features, equivalent to energy and coherence. Magnetism changes light polarization, and vice versa. The irradiation of intense circularly polarized femtosecond pules to magnetic materials can alter the magnetic orders and elementary excitations, particularly in the visible to infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the recent development of x-ray free-electron laser enables the element-specific trace of the ultrafast dynamics with high time and spatial resolution. However, the light helicity of x-ray photons has not yet been used to control order parameters in condensed matter materials, not limited to such magnetic phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt multilayer solely by irradiating femtosecond pulses of circularly polarized hard x-rays. The observed all-optical magnetization switching depends on the helicity of incident x-ray pulses and is strongly resonant with the photon energy at the Pt $L_3$ edge. These results originate in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism of Pt, involving helicity-dependent excitation from the 2$p_{3/2}$ core level to the exchange-split 5$d$ valence states owing to the magnetic proximity effect with Co. These findings mark a new frontier for examining interactions between light and matter in the x-ray region.</p>

            <h2>Polariton XY-simulators revisited</h2>

            <p>Arrays of bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons have emerged as a promising platform for simulating classical XY models, capable of rapidly reaching phase-locked states that may be mapped to arrays of two-dimensional classical spins. However, it remains unclear whether these states genuinely minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how the convergence time scales with the system size. Here, we develop an analytical model revealing that an array of $N$ condensates possesses $N$ stable phase configurations. The system selectively amplifies a specific configuration dependent on the pump power: at low power, the state with the smallest eigenvalue of an effective XY Hamiltonian is favored, while at high power, the state with the largest eigenvalue prevails. At intermediate pump powers, the system visits all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Crucially, the formation rate for any of these phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, independent of the size of the array, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of polariton-based XY simulators.</p>

            <h2>High-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Buckled Honeycomb Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Hafez-Torbati, Götz S. Uhrig</p>
            <p>We propose Néel antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulators with a buckled honeycomb structure as potential candidates to host a high-temperature AF Chern insulator (AFCI). Using a generalized Kondo lattice model we show that the staggered potential induced by a perpendicular electric field due to the buckling can drive the AF Mott insulator to an AFCI phase. We address the temperature evolution of the Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The quantization temperature $T_q$, below which the Hall conductance is quantized, depends essentially on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the hopping parameter, independent of the specific details of the model. The deviation of the Hall conductance from the quantized value $e^2/h$ above $T_q$ is found to be accompanied by a spectral broadening of the chiral edge states, reflecting a finite life-time, i.e., a decay. Using parameters typical for heavy transition-metal elements we predict that the AFCI can survive up to room temperature. We suggest Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ as a potential compound to realize a high-$T$ AFCI phase.</p>

            <p>In the recently discovered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave order. The pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. Here, utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe Fermi-surface-dependent anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure with anisotropy exceeding 80% and a gap maximum along the V-V bond direction on a Fermi surface originating from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V kagome lattice. This is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap structure on the Fermi surface occupied by Sb 5p-orbital electrons. Our direct observation of the Fermi-surface-dependent anisotropic pairing in CsV3Sb5 is fundamental for understanding the intertwined orders in the ground state of kagome superconductors.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment, which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based quantum processors fidelity.</p>

            <p>Localized $5d^2$ electrons in a cubic crystal field possess multipoles such as electric quadrupoles and magnetic octupoles. We studied the cubic double perovskite Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ containing the Os$^{6+}$ ($5d^2$) ions, which exhibits a phase transition to a `hidden order' below $T^* \sim$ 50 K, by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Os $L_{2,3}$ edge. The cubic ligand-field splitting between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ levels of Os $5d$ was deduced by XAS to be $\sim$4 eV. The temperature dependence of the XMCD spectra was consistent with a $\sim$18 meV residual cubic splitting of the lowest $J_{\rm eff} =$ 2 multiplet state into the non-Kramers $E_g$ doublet ground state and the $T_{2g}$ triplet excited state. Ligand-field (LF) multiplet calculation under fictitious strong magnetic fields indicated that the exchange interaction between nearest-neighbor octupoles should be as strong as $\sim$1.5 meV if a ferro-octupole order is stabilized in the `hidden-ordered' state, consistent with the exchange interaction of $\sim$1 meV previously predicted theoretically using model and density functional theory calculations.</p>

            <p>Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cvetič-Lü-Pope solution.</p>

All critical points extracted from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at $p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest finite-size effects.

            <p>Radiation-induced defects can have a significant impact on the longevity and performance of semiconductor devices. We present an Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) method that integrates first-principles defect properties and experimentally measured parameters into a device model to dynamically simulate the defect chemistry in semiconductors. For a silicon-doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) material, we showcase three capabilities: (i) Fermi level $E_F$ movement including its component electron and hole Fermi levels, (ii) dynamical charge equilibration with the arsenic vacancy serving as an example, and a (iii) diffusion-driven reaction between Coulomb attracted gallium interstitial ($Ga_i$) and arsenic vacancy ($v_{As}$). Governed by charge carrier reactions, the electron and hole Fermi levels remained dissimilar until equilibrium was achieved at $E_F\approx1.32$ eV. The equilibrium Fermi level was verified by successfully identifying $v_{As}^{3-}$ as the most populated charge state within the arsenic vacancy defect. Lastly, a Coulomb attraction, created by the shifted Fermi level and the charge equilibration process, between $Ga_i^{1+}$ and $v_{As}^{3-}$ resulted in the formation of a doubly negative gallium antisite ($Ga_{As}^{2-}$). The AIDE method can access experimentally inaccessible short-time and low-concentration regimes, is generalizable to other more complex systems (e.g., indium gallium arsenide), and, after solving open problems in GaAs, will serve as a virtual experiment to bound estimates for difficult-to-measure physical quantities.</p>

            <h2>A Normalized Descriptor for Unbiased Screening of Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aubrey G. J. Nyiri, Michael J. Waters, James M. Rondinelli</p>
            <p>Second-order nonlinear optical materials enable frequency doubling of light (second-harmonic generation, SHG), which is essential for optoelectronic applications ranging from materials characterization to quantum technologies. However, comparing SHG performance across materials remains challenging as the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ spans several orders of magnitude and strongly depends on the band gap $E_g$. To address this, we empirically validate a theoretical upper bound on $\chi^{(2)}$ using new databases of \textit{ab initio}-computed nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We then formulate a normalized descriptor, $\hat{d}$, which expresses the NLO response of a material relative to the band gap-dependent physical limit. We show that $\hat{d}$ exhibits a similar distribution across a wide range of band gap energies. This universality supports the use of $\hat{d}$ as a robust, generalizable descriptor for data-driven and chemistry-informed machine learning models of NLO response, enabling accelerated materials discovery and optimization across broad application frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Bistability and Exact Reflectionless States in Nonlinear Scattering of a Bose--Einstein Condensate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feilong Wang, Jinlin Fan, Ruolin Chai, Zhibin Zhao, Qiongtao Xie</p>
            <p>We investigate the mean-field scattering dynamics of a quasi-one-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensate interacting with a Rosen--Morse potential. For specific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact, degenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect transmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the stability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only one solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity, identifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical analysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability to bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes an analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly relevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and optical propagation in engineered photonic lattices.</p>

            <h2>Free Majorana Modes in Superconducting Quantum Wires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karyn Le Hur</p>
            <p>An s-wave superconducting wire with attractive interactions can admit a zero-energy bound state equation (solution) at an edge similar to the Jackiw-Rebbi model; this is a specific aspect of low-dimensional quantum systems, Dirac equation and e.g. of the Luther-Emery liquid with a spin gap. In this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes, i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when including perturbations.</p>

            <h2>Giant field-tunable nonlinear Hall effect by Lorentz skew scattering in a graphene moire superlattice</h2>

            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can enable rectification and energy harvesting, and its control by external fields, including gate, strain and magnetic field, has been pursued intensively. However, existing tuning pathways rely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically inefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this work, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE originating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\mu}mV-1{\Omega}-1) near van Hove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude larger than all previously reported NHEs. Our findings establish an efficient, magnetic-field-driven route to giant Hall rectification in high-mobility materials, offering a broadly applicable paradigm for modulating the NHE beyond electrostatic gating.</p>

            <p>We study the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions between a single terahertz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator (cSRR) and a two-dimensional electron gas. For this purpose, transmission spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\eta$ = 0.46 down to $\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruth H. Tichauer, Maksim Lednev, Gerrit Groenhof, Johannes Feist</p>
            <p>In the context of light-matter interactions between organic chromophores and confined photons of (plasmonic) nano-resonators, we introduce a general framework that couples ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics with few-mode field quantization to simulate light-matter interactions of molecular emitters at the nanoscale. Arbitrary, lossy, and spatially inhomogeneous photonic environments are represented by a minimal set of interacting modes fitted to their spectral density, while geometry-dependent molecular properties are computed on the fly. Applications to few-molecule strong coupling show that strong coupling persists when molecular degrees of freedom and disorder are included for the chosen system consisting of a nanoparticle dimer coupled to multiple emitters. At the same time, symmetry-protected degeneracies of two-level models are lifted. The framework further reveals how spatial field inhomogeneity and molecular disorder shape cavity-mediated energy transfer, illustrated for an HBQ-Methylene Blue donor-acceptor combination in a five-emitter system.</p>

            <p>The integration of single-atom bits enables the realization of the highest data-density memory. Reading and writing information to these bits through mechanical interactions opens the possibility of operating the magnetic devices with low heat generation and high density recording. To achieve this visionary goal, we demonstrate the use of magnetic exchange force microscopy to read and write the spin orientation of individual holmium adatoms on MgO thin films. The spin orientation of the holmium adatom is stabilized by the strong uniaxial anisotropy of the adsorption site and can be read out by measuring the exchange forces between the magnetic tip and the atom. The spin orientation can be written by approaching the tip closer to the holmium this http URL explain this writing mechanism by the symmetry reduction of the adsorption site of the Ho adatom. These findings demonstrate the potential for information storage with minimal energy loss and pave the way for a new field of atomic-scale mechano-spintronics.</p>

            <p>Thermal logic aims to create thermal counterparts to electronic circuits. In this work, we investigate experimentally the response of an analog memory device based on a thin film of an antiferromagnetic metal CuMnAs to bursts of heat pulses generated by the absorption of femtosecond laser pulses at room ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat pulses.</p>

            <h2>From Lasers to Photon Bose--Einstein Condensates: A Unified Description via an Open-Dissipative Bose--Einstein Distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Krauß, Enrico Stein, Axel Pelster</p>
            <p>Photon condensation was first experimentally realized in 2010 within a dye-filled microcavity at room temperature. Since then, interest in the field has increased significantly, as a photon Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) represents a prototypical driven-dissipative system. Here, we investigate how its inherent open nature influences the condensation process both quantitatively and qualitatively. To this end, we consider a mean-field model, which can be derived microscopically from a Lindblad master equation. The underlying rate equations depend on various external parameters such as emission and absorption rates of the dye molecules as well as the cavity photon loss rate. In steady state, we obtain an open-dissipative Bose-Einstein distribution for the mode occupations. The chemical potential of this distribution depends on the occupations of the dye molecules in both their ground and excited state and must therefore be determined self-consistently. We find that the resulting photon distribution is strongly influenced by the driven-dissipative parameters. Based on this result, we identify the main differences between a photonic BEC, an atomic BEC, and a laser.</p>

            <h2>Multiferroic-like Quasiparticles in Ferroelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Tang, Gerrit E. W. Bauer</p>
            <p>Multiferroics are materials with coexisting electric and magnetic orders that are of central importance for fundamental research and technological applications. Unfortunately, intrinsic multiferroics that operate at room temperature remain rare due to an apparent incompatibility between magnetism and ferroelectricity. Here we predict that a pure ferroelectric support multiferroic-like quasiparticles, termed ``multiferrons", that simultaneously carry \emph{static} magnetic and electric dipoles. The electric dipole moment emerges from the parity-odd anharmonicity of the ferroelectric dynamics, while the magnetic moment has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic origins generated by circularly polarized transverse fluctuations of the ferroelectric polarization. In contrast to the established ``dynamical multiferroicity" of circularly polarized phonons, which involve only \emph{oscillating} electric dipoles, multiferrons cause, apart from Zeeman and Einstein-de Haas effects, a linear dc Stark response, giant electric-field-tunable second-harmonic generation in the THz-frequency regime, and a finite magnetoelectric cross coupling. Multiferrons open a new route toward nonlinear THz optical applications and offer multiferroic functionalities with simple ferroelectrics.</p>

            <p>Tissue dynamics play a crucial role in biological processes ranging from inflammation to morphogenesis. However, these noisy multicellular dynamics are notoriously hard to predict. Here, we introduce a biomimetic machine learning framework capable of inferring noisy multicellular dynamics directly from experimental movies. This generative model combines graph neural networks, normalizing flows and WaveNet algorithms to represent tissues as neural stochastic differential equations where cells are edges of an evolving graph. Cell interactions are encoded in a dual signaling graph capable of handling signaling cascades. The dual graph architecture of our neural networks reflects the architecture of the underlying biological tissues, substantially reducing the amount of data needed for training, compared to convolutional or fully-connected neural networks. Taking epithelial tissue experiments as a case study, we show that our model not only captures stochastic cell motion but also predicts the evolution of cell states in their division cycle. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately generate the experimental dynamics of developmental systems, such as the fly wing, and cell signaling processes mediated by stochastic ERK waves, paving the way for its use as a digital twin in bioengineering and clinical contexts.</p>

            <p>The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors.</p>

We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases.

            <h2>Solution to a Quantum Impurity Model for Moiré Systems: Fermi Liquid, Pairing, and Pseudogap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Jie Wang, Geng-Dong Zhou, Hyunsung Jung, Seongyeon Youn, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals. This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential, pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$, $J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S>J_D$) or a valley doublet ($J_D>J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when $J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet (local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG calculations.</p>

Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling.

            <p>The coherence of hole spin qubits in germanium planar heterostructures is limited by the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath due to 29Si and 73Ge isotopes. Thus, removing these nuclear spin-full isotopes is essential to extend the hyperfine-limited coherence times needed to implement robust quantum processors. This work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of device-grade nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures on industrial SiGe buffers while minimizing the amounts of highly purified 70GeH4 and 28SiH4 used. The obtained 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures exhibit a dislocation density of 5.3 x 10e6 cm-2 and an isotopic purity exceeding 99.99%, with carbon and oxygen impurities below the detection sensitivity, as revealed by atom probe tomography. Magnetotransport measurements on gated Hall bars demonstrate effective gate control of hole density in nuclear spin-free quantum wells. Negative threshold gate voltages confirm the absence of intentional doping in the wells, while Hall and Shubnikov-de Haas analyses yield consistent carrier densities (1.4 x 10e11 cm-2) and high mobilities (2.4 x 10e5 cm2/Vs). Mobility trends reveal interfacetrap- limited scattering and percolation concentration below 7 x 10e10 cm-2. These analyses, along with atomic-level studies, confirm the high quality of epitaxial 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures and their relevance as a platform for long-coherence spin qubits.</p>

            <p>The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives, governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime, where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states. We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting circuit platforms.</p>

            <p>The electron self-interaction problem in density functional theory affects the accurate modeling of polarons, particularly their localization and formation energy. Charged and neutral density functional formulations have been developed to address this issue, yet their relationship remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate their equivalence in treating the many-body self-interaction of the polaron state. In particular, we connect with each other piecewise-linear functionals based on adding an extra charge to the supercell, the pSIC approach derived from the energetics of the neutral defect with polaronic distortions in a supercell, and the unit-cell method for polarons based on electron-phonon couplings. We show that these approaches lead to the same formal expression of the self-interaction corrected energy, which is fully defined by the energetics of the neutral charge state of the charged polaronic structure. Residual differences between these methods solely arise from the achieved polaronic structure, which is affected by different treatments of electron-screening and finite-size effects. We apply these methods to a set of prototypical small hole and electron polarons, including the hole polaron in MgO, the hole polaron in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, the $V_\text{k}$ center in NaI, the electron polaron in BiVO$_4$, and the electron polaron in TiO$_2$. We show that the ground-state properties of polarons obtained using charged and neutral density functional formulations are in excellent agreement.</p>

            <p>The hybridization gap in strained-layer InAs/InxGa1-xSb quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) is significantly enhanced compared to binary InAs/GaSb QSHI structures, where the typical indium composition, x, ranges between 0.2 and 0.4. This enhancement prompts a critical question: to what extent can quantum wells (QWs) be strained while still preserving the fundamental QSHI phase? In this study, we demonstrate the controlled molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of highly strained-layer QWs with an indium composition of x = 0.5. These structures possess a substantial compressive strain within the In0.5Ga0.5Sb QW. Detailed crystal structure analyses confirm the exceptional quality of the resulting epitaxial films, indicating coherent lattice structures and the absence of visible dislocations. Transport measurements further reveal that the QSHI phase in InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb QWs is robust and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Notably, the edge states in these systems exhibit giant magnetoresistance when subjected to a modest perpendicular magnetic field. This behavior is in agreement with the Z2 topological property predicted by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, confirming the preservation of topologically protected edge transport in the presence of enhanced bulk strain.</p>

            <p>When particles move through a crystal or optical lattice, their motion can sometimes become frozen by strong external forces -- yet collective motion may still emerge through subtle many-body effects. In this work, we explore such constrained dynamics by realizing a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, where single atoms are immobile but pairs of particles can move cooperatively while preserving the system's center of mass, i.e. the overall dipole moment of the particle distribution. Starting from a one-dimensional chain of ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice, we generate localized dipole excitations consisting of a hole and a doublon using site-resolved optical potentials and characterize their quantum walks and scattering dynamics. Our study provides a bottom-up investigation of a Hamiltonian with kinetic constraints, and paves the way for exploring low-energy phases of fractonic matter in existing experimental platforms.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast magnetic moment transfer and bandgap renormalization in monolayer \ce{FeCl2}</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hui Song, Huan-Cheng Yang, Kai Liu, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic \ce{FeCl2} monolayer using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms. More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer, attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to $41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Time-Reversed Superfluorescence in a Polaronic Quantum Material</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Ghosh, Patrick Brosseau, Dmitry N. Dirin, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Patanjali Kambhampati</p>
            <p>Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and superabsorbing quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuumś Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahima Yadav, Devvrat Tiwari, Subhashish Banerjee</p>
            <p>Quantum batteries have emerged as promising platforms for exploring energy storage and transfer processes governed by quantum mechanical laws. In this work, we study three models of two-qubit open quantum systems. The first model comprises two central spins immersed in spin baths, and both central spins are collectively considered as quantum batteries. The impact of inter-qubit interactions on the performance of the quantum battery is investigated. In the second model, a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath serves as a collective quantum battery, where the impact of inter-atomic distance and the bath temperature on the battery's performance is explored. Furthermore, a two-qubit model is used, where one qubit is modeled as a battery and the other as a charger. The charger in this model interacts with an anisotropic spin-chain bath, which is conducive to quantum criticality. It is demonstrated that this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage capacity.</p>

            <p>In this work, we introduce a family of new equivalence relations among fusion categories that are less refined than the usual Morita equivalence. We obtain abelian groups by quotienting these new equivalence relations from the commutative monoids of the equivalence classes of all fusion categories. Moreover, we upgrade them to equivalence relations among nondegenerate braided fusion categories that are more refined than the usual Witt equivalence. As a consequence, we obtain new abelian groups that are more refined than the usual Witt group. These new groups allow us to access the internal structures within Witt classes. We expect that they are useful in the classification program of (braided) fusion (higher) categories and in the study of gapless edges of 2+1D topological orders.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Hao Ding, Li-Jun Lang, Qizhong Zhu, Liang He</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Sliding and superlubric moiré twisting ferroelectric transition in HfO2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Sun, Yiheng Shen, Tengfei Cao, Li-Min Liu</p>
            <p>Despite progress in HfO2 thin-film ferroelectrics, issues like high coercive fields persist, and the dynamics of twisted ferroelectricity remain largely unexplored. Here, we explore how sliding and twisting in bilayer HfO2 enables low barrier switching. Among 144 sliding configurations, two exhibit strong in-plane polarization (2360 pC/m) with a low switching barrier of 9.57 meV/f.u. Twisting generates polar textures associated with moiré patterns, which drive ferroelectricity via a soft zone-center mode, as revealed by machine-learning-assisted first-principles calculations. The in-plane (out-of-plane) polarization values for HfO2 at twist angles of 21.79°, 27.80°, and 46.83° are 430 (5.82), 367 (2.20), and 1057 (0.03) pC/m, respectively. For 21.79° and 27.80° twisting, switching barriers drop to 1.74 and 0.18 meV/f.u., indicating superlubric-like transitions. Notably, the 46.83° twisted bilayer shows an almost barrier-free polar evolution (0.03 meV /f.u.), attributed to sharply enhanced zone-center phonon linewidths. Our findings establish a moiré-engineered switching route for 2D ferroelectrics.</p>

            <p>Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.</p>

            <h2>Maximum Quantum Work at Criticality: Stirling Engines and Fibonacci-Lucas Degeneracies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bastian Castorene, Martin HvE Groves, Francisco J. Peña, Eugenio E. Vogel, Patricio Vargas</p>
            <p>Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining the performance of quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by $ W = k_B \delta \ln (g_{\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $ \delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \eta_C = 1 - T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work.</p>

            <p>This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.</p>

            <p>Many topological phases host gapless boundary modes that can be dramatically modified by electronic interactions. Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for copropagating modes, and induce unexpected edge valley polarization that differ from those of the bulk. While some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes STM as a promising tool for exploring edge physics of the rapidly expanding 2D topological phases, including newly realized fractional Chern insulators.</p>

            <p>The discovery of effective molecular modulators is essential for advancing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the research process is hindered by the vastness of chemical space and the time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error experimental screening. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) offers significant potential for accelerating materials discovery. However, applying ML to PSCs remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and limitations of traditional quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Here, we apply a chemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural networks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is established through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular representations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over 79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage interpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation and experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite interactions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are subsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved champion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs.</p>

Specifically, we predict that relatively high-temperature superconductivity can be induced in bilayer graphene twisted to an angle somewhat larger than the magic value by surrounding it with a THz polar dielectric. Our conclusions are based on numerical solutions of Eliashberg equations for massless Dirac fermions with tunable Fermi velocities and Fermi energies, and can be understood qualitatively in terms of a generalized McMillan formula.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Zhao, Fu Li, Wei Ren, Hao Wang, Hongbin Zhang</p>
            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) are a recently identified class of unconventional collinear compensated antiferromagnets that exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This unconventional magnetic order gives rise to a range of phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, chiral magnons, and nonlinear photocurrents. Here, using spin space group (SSG) symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to control altermagnetism in two-dimensional multiferroics through ferroelectric polarization and interlayer sliding. For material realization, we find that monolayer and bilayer FeCuP2S6 exhibit finite spin splitting when ferroelectric sublattices are connected by nonsymmorphic screw-axis operations rather than pure translation or inversion symmetry. Interlayer sliding further enables reversible switching or suppression of spin splitting through modifications of the SSG. Our calculations further reveal that the anomalous Hall response serves as a direct probe of these spin-split states. These findings establish two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics as promising platforms for realizing electrically controllable altermagnetism and advancing next-generation spintronic and magnetoelectric technologies.</p>

Here, we report preliminarily experimental advances in creating, manipulating, and exchanging the presumed Majorana zero modes in an envelope-shaped Josephson device composed of multiple trijunctions on a topological insulator surface. We observed the signatures of in-gap states migration consistent with the expectations of the Fu-Kane model, supporting the realization of an exchange operation.

            <p>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are essential for next-generation, high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), yet their rational design is hampered by the high computational cost of accurate excited-state predictions. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark study validating semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods -- specifically sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB -- for the high-throughput screening of TADF materials. Using an unprecedentedly large dataset of \num{747} experimentally characterized emitters, our framework demonstrates a computational cost reduction of over \qty{99}{\percent} compared to conventional TD-DFT, while maintaining strong internal consistency between methods (Pearson $r \approx \num{0.82}$ for \deltaest), validating their utility for relative molecular ranking. Validation against \num{312} experimental \deltaest values reveals a mean absolute error of approximately \qty{0.17}{\electronvolt}, a discrepancy attributed to the vertical approximation inherent to the HTS protocol, underscoring the methods' role in screening rather than quantitative prediction. Through large-scale data analysis, we statistically validate key design principles, confirming the superior performance of Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures and identifying an optimal D-A torsional angle range of \qtyrange{50}{90}{\degree} for efficient TADF. Principal Component Analysis reveals that the complex property space is fundamentally low-dimensional, with three components capturing nearly \qty{90}{\percent} of the variance. This work establishes these semi-empirical methods as powerful, cost-effective tools for accelerating TADF discovery and provides a robust set of data-driven design rules and methodological guidelines for the computational materials science community.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianliang Zhou, Yifan Gao, Laiyuan Su, Z. F. Wang, Li Huang, Angel Rubio, Zhiwen Shi, Lede Xian</p>
            <p>Moiré superlattices provide a compelling platform for exploring exotic correlated physics. Electronic interference within these systems often results in flat bands with localized electrons, which are typically described by effective moiré lattice models. While conventional models treat moiré sites as indivisible, analogous to atoms in a crystal, this picture overlooks a crucial distinction: unlike a true atom, a moiré site is composed of tens to thousands of atoms and is therefore spatially divisible. Here, we introduce a universal mechanism rooted in this spatial divisibility to create topological boundary states in moiré materials. Through tight-binding and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that cutting a moiré site with a physical boundary induces bulk topological polarization, generating robust boundary states with fractional charges. We further show that when the net edge polarization is canceled, this mechanism drives the system into an intrinsic moiré higher-order topological insulator (mHOTI) phase. As a concrete realization, we predict that twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide ($WS_2$) is a robust mHOTI with experimentally detectable corner states when its boundaries cut through moiré hole sites. Our findings generalize the theoretical framework of moiré higher-order topology, highlight the critical role of edge terminations, and suggest new opportunities for realizing correlated HOTIs and higher-order superconductivity in moiré platforms.</p>

            <h2>Polaronic-Distortion-Driven Enhancement of Excitonic Auger Recombination in ZnO Nanoparticles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fuyong Hua, Zheng Zhang, Zhong Wang, Yang Liu, Changchang Gong, Chunlong Hu, Yinhua Zhou, Wenxi Liang</p>
            <p>The surface effect and quantum confinement render nanomaterials the optoelectronic properties more susceptible to nonradiative processes than their bulk counterparts. These nonradiative processes usually contain a series of interwoven and competing sub-processes, which are challenging to disentangle. Here, we investigate the structural origin of Auger recombination in ZnO nanoparticles using transient absorption spectroscopy and ultrafast electron diffraction. The photogenerated hot holes are captured by oxygen vacancies through an Auger mechanism, inducing significant local structural distortions around the oxygen vacancy and its neighboring zinc tetrahedron on a sub-picosecond timescale. The recombination of trapped holes accelerates the lattice thermalization and stabilizes the formed small hole polarons. Subsequently, the recombination of localized polarons forms a confined exciton-polaron complex that may account for the long-lived (>7 ns) visible luminescence observed in ZnO nanoparticles. Our findings are potentially applicable to other transition metal oxide nanomaterials, bringing insights for the optimization of their functional properties.</p>

            <h2>Improved contraction of finite projected entangled pair states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus Scheb</p>
            <p>We present an improved version of the algorithm contracting and optimizing finite projected entangled pair states (fPEPS) in conjunction with projected entangled pair operators (PEPOs). Our work has two components to it. First, we explain in detail the characteristic contraction patterns that occur in fPEPS calculations and how to slice them such that peak memory occupation remains minimal while ensuring efficient parallel computation. Second, we combine controlled bond expansion [A. Gleis, J.-W. Li, and J. von Delft, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)] with randomized singular value decomposition [V. Rokhlin, A. Szlam, and M. Tygert, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. (2009)] and apply it throughout the fPEPS algorithm. We present benchmark results for the Hubbard model for system sizes up to 8x8 and SU(2) symmetric bond dimension of up to D = 6 for PEPS bonds and $\chi$ = 500 for the environment bonds. Finally, we comment on the state and future of the fPEPS-PEPO framework.</p>

They appear due to electron-electron interactions under condition of the magnetic breakdown phenomenon between the so-called open interference electron orbits. We argue that such forbidden thermodynamic oscillations can exist in Q1D conductors (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$, where TMTSF stands for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, Per is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and mnt is mononitrotoluene, and suggest to discover them.</p>

            <h2>Exposing Altermagnetism through Momentum Density Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenhan Chen, Alyn D. N. James, Stephen B. Dugdale</p>
            <p>Materials which show a strong time-reversal symmetry-breaking response leading to spin-polarization phenomena, in conjunction with antiparallel magnetic alignments producing zero net magnetization, have recently been identified, classified, and been given the name 'altermagnets'. However, measuring and diagnosing possible candidates as altermagnetics still remains a challenge. From the uncertainty of the material being an altermagnet, additional experimental probes are essential to resolve this. Here, we propose using spin-dependent and magnetic momentum density probes such as spin-polarised positron annihilation and revisiting magnetic Compton scattering. By looking at the previously claimed altermagnetic candidates RuO2, CrSb and MnTe, we present theoretical altermagnetic calculations of the experimental quantities measured by these probes. We show that these quantities should produce a measurable signal and unequivocally confirm the altermagnetic state. We also highlight the additional benefits from these probes such as extracting spin-resolved Fermi surfaces which are key for further understanding the nature of the altermagnetic state.</p>

            <p>Coherent ferrons, the quanta of polarization waves, can potentially be hybridized with many other quasiparticles for achieving novel control modalities in quantum communication, computing, and sensing. Here, we theoretically demonstrate a new hybridized state resulting from the strong coupling between fundamental-mode (wavenumber is zero) coherent ferrons and cavity bulk acoustic phonons. Using a van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6 membrane as an example, we predict an ultra-strong ferron-phonon coupling at room temperature, where the coupling strength g_c reaches over 10% of the resonant frequency {\omega}_0. We also predict an in-situ electric-field-driven bistable control of mode-specific ferron-phonon hybridization via ferroelectric switching. We further show that, CuInP2S6 allows for reaching the fundamentally intriguing but challenging deep strong coupling regime (i.e., g_c/{\omega}_0>1) near the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. Our findings establish the theoretical basis for exploiting coherent ferrons as a new contender for hybrid quantum system with strong and highly tunable coherent coupling.</p>

            <h2>Rheological Behavior of Colloidal Silica Dispersion: Irreversible Aging and Thixotropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Kumar, Yogesh M. Joshi</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the rheological behavior of colloidal dispersion of charge-screened nanoparticles of silica suspended in aqueous media that exhibits soft solid-like consistency. We observe that the system shows various characteristics of physical aging wherein it undergoes time evolution of rheological properties such as elastic modulus, relaxation time, and yield stress subsequent to shear melting of the same. Notably, the relaxation time increases more strongly than linearly with time, which is suggestive of hyper-aging dynamics. When considered along with the time-dependent yield stress, this behavior indicates the steady state shear stress-shear rate flow curve to be non-monotonic with a negative slope in a lower shear rate region. Performing shear melting on this system at a later date since the preparation of the dispersion (rest time) results in higher viscosity as well as yield stress, and the corresponding evolution of the elastic modulus shifts to lower times. This implies that physical aging in studied silica dispersion, while reversible over short time scales (of the order of hours), becomes irreversible over longer durations (days) owing to the inability of strong shear to break interparticle bonds that have strengthened over long durations. We also develop a thixotropic structural kinetic model within a time-dependent Maxwell framework that captures the experimentally observed rheological behavior well.</p>

            <h2>Robust structural superlubricity of twisted graphene bilayer and domain walls between commensurate moiré pattern domains from first-principles calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irina V. Lebedeva, Andrey M. Popov, Yulia G. Polynskaya, Andrey A. Knizhnik, Sergey A. Vyrko, Nikolai A. Poklonski</p>
            <p>Twisted graphene layers exhibit extremely low friction for relative sliding. Nevertheless, previous studies suggest that the area contribution to friction for commensurate moiré systems is finite and might restrict macroscopic superlubricity for large layer overlaps. In this paper, we investigate the potential energy surface (PES) for relative displacement of the layers forming moiré patterns (2,1) and (3,1) by accurate density functional theory calculations using the vdW-DF3 functional. The amplitudes of PES corrugations on the order of 0.4 and 0.03 $\mu$eV per atom of one layer, respectively, are obtained. The account of structural relaxation doubles this value for the (2,1) pattern, while causing only minimal changes for the (3,1) pattern. We show that different from aligned graphene layers, for moiré patterns, PES minima and maxima can switch their positions upon changing the interlayer distance. The PES shape is closely described by the first spatial Fourier harmonics both with and without account of structural relaxation. A barrier for relative rotation of the layers to an incommensurate state that can make superlubricity robust is estimated based on the approximated PES. We also derive a set of measurable physical properties related to interlayer interaction including shear mode frequency, shear modulus and static friction force. Furthermore, we predict that it should be possible to observe domain walls separating commensurate domains, each comprising a large number of moiré pattern unit cells, and provide estimates of their characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Intertwined Hyperferroelectricity, Tunable Multiple Topological Phases and Giant Rashba Effect in Wurtzite LiZnAs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saurav Patel, Paras Patel, Shaohui Qiu, Prafulla K. Jha</p>
            <p>Composite quantum compounds offer a fertile ground for uncovering the complex interrelations between seemingly distinct phenomena in condensed matter physics for advanced nonvolatile and spintronics applications. Beyond topological superconductors and axion insulators, the idea of intertwined Hyperferroelectricity (HyFE), multiple topological phases and Rashba spin-splitting with reversible spin textures represents the local, global and symmetry-driven characteristics of quantum materials, respectively, offering unique pathways for enhanced functionalities. We unveiled a unified framework to achieve this synergy through the presence of crystalline symmetries and spin-orbit coupling in LiZnAs compound using first-principles calculations. HyFE exhibits ability to maintain spontaneous polarization under open-circuit boundary conditions, even with existence of depolarization field while Rashba effect exhibits paradigmatic spin texture in momentum space with tangential vector field. The presence of unstable $A_{2u}(LO)$ mode leads to free energy minimum with significant well depth and polarization of -66 meV and $P_{HyFE} = 0.282~C/m^2$, respectively indicating stable HyFE. The robust HyFE stem from mode-specific effective charges and larger high-frequency dielectric constants. This study also addresses the subtle question of whether critical point of topological phase transition shifts in response to drastically different Rashba spin-splitting values obtained from VASP and WIEN2k. Moreover, biaxial strain (BAS) induced Weyl semimetal (at 3.4% BAS) and topological insulating phase (after 3.4% BAS) is observed with giant Rashba coefficient of 5.91 eV Å and 2.42 eV Å, respectively. Furthermore, switching of bulk polarization leads to spin texture reversal, providing a robust mechanism to leverage spin degrees of freedom in these Hyperferroelectric Rashba topological materials.</p>

            <p>Single crystals of $\alpha$-MnTe were synthesized by chemical vapor transport using iodine as the transport reagent. Structural characterization by powder x-ray diffraction confirmed the hexagonal structure (space group P6$_{3}$/mmc). Magnetization $M(T)$ and specific heat $C_p(T)$ measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \approx307$ K. The magnetic entropy derived from the $C_p(T)$ data is consistent with the $S = 5/2$ spin state of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. Angle- and field-dependent magnetization measurements indicate complex magnetic responses associated with domains, and show an anomaly around 1 T. These features are analyzed using a phenomenological micromagnetic model that includes higher-order anisotropic exchange interactions coupling the weak ferromagnetic component and the antiferromagnetic order parameter. The model captures the generic behavior of magnetic states and demonstrates that the observed uniaxial and unidirectional anisotropies arise from metastable domain configurations and irreversible magnetization processes.</p>

            <p>Protected states are promising for quantum technologies due to their intrinsic resilience against noise. However, such states often emerge at discrete points or small regions in parameter space and are thus difficult to find in experiments. In this work, we present a machine-learning method for tuning to protected regimes, based on injecting noise into the system and searching directly for the most noise-resilient configuration. We illustrate this method by considering short quantum dot-based Kitaev chains which we subject to random parameter fluctuations. Using the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy we minimize the typical resulting ground state splitting, which makes the system converge to a protected configuration with well-separated Majorana bound states. We verify the robustness of our method by considering finite Zeeman fields, electron-electron repulsion, asymmetric couplings, and varying the length of the Kitaev chain. Our work provides a reliable method for tuning to protected states, including but not limited to isolated Majorana bound states.</p>

            <p>Frequency combs represent a hallmark of coherence emerging from nonlinear dynamics, where periodic driving organizes energy into a precisely spaced spectral structure. Extending this concept to collective excitations in solids such as magnons, the quanta of spin waves in magnetically ordered materials, offers a powerful route to control energy flow, coherence, and information processing in condensed matter systems. Here, we demonstrate deterministic control of Floquet-engineered magnon frequency combs in magnetic vortices using nanosecond voltage pulses. By tuning the pulse duration and timing, we control the nonlinear energy transfer between magnons and the vortex core, enabling the Floquet-engineered initiation or suppression of magnon frequency combs far below their spontaneous instability threshold. This pulse-programmable interaction allows the vortex to sustain magnon-driven auto-oscillation with high phase stability, or to revert to its static ground state on demand. Our results establish vortex-based magnetic systems as a robust solid-state platform for Floquet engineering, bridging nonlinear spin dynamics with frequency conversion and coherent spin-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Fei Huang, Houssam Sabri, Jiadong Zang, Jie-Xiang Yu</p>
            <p>Strong coupling among spontaneous structural symmetric breaking, magnetism and metallicity in an intrinsic polar magnetic metal can give rise to novel physical phenomena and holds great promise for applications in spintronics. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of metallic ferroelectricity in the recently discovered polar metal Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our first-principles calculations reveal that both the spontaneous ferroelectric displacements and the metallicity originate from charge disproportionation of Co ions. This is characterized by an inverted ligand-field splitting of the Co $t_2g$ orbitals at one site, while the metallic behavior is preserved by the t$_2g$ orbitals at both sites. The charge disproportionation stabilizes the asymmetric phase Within the framework of the on-site Hubbard U interaction. We thus propose that in related transition metal oxides, charge disproportionation within specific orbitals can concurrently drive metallicity and ferroelectricity, enabling strong coupling between these properties. More remarkably, this mechanism allows for the coexistence of magnetism, as evidenced in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our findings highlight a promising avenue for realizing polar magnetic metals and provide a new design principle for exploring multifunctional materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manon Bourgade, Nicolas Bain, Loïc Vanel, Mathieu Leocmach, Catherine Barentin</p>
            <p>Forcing hydrophilic fluids through hydrophobic porous solids is a recurrent industrial challenge. If the penetrating fluid is Newtonian, the imposed pressure has to overcome the capillary pressure at the fluid-air interface in a pore. The presence of a yield-stress, however, makes the pressure transfer and the penetration significantly more complex. In this study, we experimentally investigate the forced penetration of a water based yield-stress fluid through a regular hydrophobic mesh under quasi-static conditions, combining quantitative pressure measurements and direct visualisation of the penetration process. We reveal that the penetration is controlled by a competition between the yield-stress and two distinct pressures. The capillary pressure, that dictates the threshold at which the yield-stress fluid penetrates the hydrophobic mesh, and a priming pressure, that controls how the fluid advances through it. The latter corresponds to a pressure drop ensuing a local capillary instability, never reported before. Our findings shine a new light on forced imbibition processes, with direct implications on their fundamental understanding and practical engineering.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled networks of metallic nanowires (NWs) are being intensively explored as test benches for neuromorphic proposals. In this work, we study the electric transport properties of dense self-assembled networks of Ag-based NWs (AgNWNs) coated with a thin insulating layer, using DC and AC stimuli. The building blocks of this network are the metallic NWs and the NW-NW junctions, either metallic or memristive. In the pristine state, frequency independence of the impedance reveals an over-percolated purely resistive network. A combination of low-temperature annealing and AC stimulus is shown to drastically affect the resistivity of the sample (interpreted as a depopulation of purely metallic junctions), unveiling a rich dynamic response. This procedure triggers the achievement of a capacitive response, which is successfully rationalized using a previously introduced 'two junction model'. Thermal treatment appears to be an indirect strategy to effectively modify the humidity content at the NW-NW intersections and, consequently, enable multiple switching schemes suitable for brain-like processing alternatives.</p>

While both take the universal values $G_V({\omega = 0}) = e^2/h$ and $S_V(\omega = 0) = 4 e^2 k_{\rm B} T/h$ in the zero-frequency limit, $G_V(\omega)$ and $S_V(\omega)$ are quickly suppressed for finite $\omega$, so that low-frequency transport is effectively noiseless.</p>

            <p>Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a nonlinear optical material of high interest for integrated photonics with applications ranging from optical communications to quantum information processing. The performance of on-chip devices based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by fabrication imperfections such as sidewall surface roughness and geometry inhomogeneities over the chip. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially be used to overcome these difficulties. Although an isotropic ALE process for LN has been reported, performing LN fabrication completely with ALE faces several challenges, including the lack of a directional ALE process for pattern transfer and the redeposition of involatile compounds. Here, we report a directional ALE process for LN consisting of sequential exposures of HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma for surface modification and Ar plasma for removal. The HBr chemistry is found to decrease redeposition compared to F- and Cl-based plasmas, which we attribute to the higher vapor pressures of Br-based products. A grating pattern etched entirely by the process (total etch depth of 220 nm) exhibits no aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) down to the smallest tested gap of 150 nm, in contrast to ion milling in which ARDE manifests even at 300 nm gaps for the same etch depth. The HBr plasma chemistry is also found to support an isotropic process consisting of sequential exposures of H$_2$ plasma and HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma. These processes could be used together to perform the complete fabrication process for TFLN devices, eliminating imperfections arising from ion milling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanka Ghosh, Andreas M. Menzel</p>
            <p>When a hole is introduced into an elastic material, it will usually act to reduce the overall mechanical stiffness. A general ambition is to investigate whether a stiff shell around the hole can act to maintain the overall mechanical properties. We consider the basic example situation of an isotropic, homogeneous, linearly elastic material loaded uniformly under plane strain for low concentrations of holes. As we demonstrate, the thickness of the shell can be adjusted in a way to maintain the overall stiffness of the system. We derive a corresponding mathematical expression for the thickness of the shell that conceals the hole. Thus, one can work with given materials to mask the presence of the holes. One does not necessarily need to adjust the material parameters and thus materials themselves. Our predictions from linear elasticity continuum theory are extended to atomistic level using molecular dynamics simulations of a model Lennard-Jones solid. Small deviations from linear elasticity theory can be minimized by tuning the hole-to-system size ratio in the molecular dynamics simulations. This extension attests the robustness of our continuum predictions even at atomistic scales. The basic concept is important in the context of light-weight construction.</p>

            <p>Parametrized measures (or Young measures) enable to reformulate non-convex variational problems as convex problems at the cost of enlarging the search space from space of functions to space of measures. To benefit from such machinery, we need powerful tools for approximating measures. We develop a deep neural network approximation of Young measures in this paper. The key idea is to write the Young measure as push-forward of Gaussian mea- sures, and reformulate the problem of finding Young measures to finding the corresponding push-forward. We approximate the push-forward map us- ing deep neural networks by encoding the reformulated variational problem in the loss function. After developing the framework, we demonstrate the approach in several numerical examples. We hope this framework and our illustrative computational experiments provide a pathway for approximating Young measures in their wide range of applications from modeling complex microstructure in materials to non-cooperative games.</p>

            <p>Focused ion beams (FIBs) are widely used in nanofabrication for applications such as circuit repair, ultra-thin lamella preparation, strain engineering, and quantum device prototyping. Although the lateral spread of the ion beam is often overlooked, it becomes critical in precision tasks such as impurity placement in host substrates, where accurate knowledge of the ion-matter interaction profile is essential. Existing techniques typically characterise only the beam core, where most ions land, thus underestimating the full extent of the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we use four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to resolve the ion beam tail at defect densities equivalent to $<$0.1 ions nm$^{-2}$. Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) patterns were collected in calibration regions with known ion fluence and compared to patterns acquired around static dwell spots exposed to a 30 keV Ga$^{+}$ beam for 1-10 s. Cross-correlation using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artefacts than conventional dark-field imaging. This approach is complementary to image resolution methods enabling a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage even at low-dose regimes, offering a more accurate representation of FIB performance and supporting application tailoring beyond the conventional resolution metrics focused solely on the beam core.</p>

Typically, this coefficient is complicated and highly dependent on its details. In this work, we introduce a new perspective based on the notion of a ``phantom current''. We have shown that a spin-2 phantom current arising from the folding trick completely determines the transmission coefficient. In particular, when there is a single phantom current, the transmission coefficient is uniquely fixed by its conformal dimension. As a result, our framework provides a unified explanation of known results in minimal models and the free boson, while also yielding concrete predictions for previously unexplored interfaces.</p>

Specifically, we impose a selection rule motivated by Kramers-Wannier duality and derive bounds on the conformal dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon)$ of the lowest-lying $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd scalar $\sigma$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-even scalar $\epsilon$ in dimensions $d=2$ through $d=7$. Our bounds correctly allow the $d=2$ Ising model while excluding the $d=3$ Ising model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the imposed condition. Furthermore, we observe a distinct feature in $d=2$ corresponding to the $\mathcal{M}(8,7)$ minimal model and find non-trivial constraints in $d=3$ ($\Delta_\sigma \gtrsim 0.85$), relevant for theories like QED$_3$. This work opens a new avenue for non-perturbatively probing the vast landscape of CFTs constrained by non-invertible symmetries.</p>

            <h2>Quantum dynamics in lattices in presence of bulk dephasing and a localized source</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamoghna Ray, Katha Ganguly, Dario Poletti, Manas Kulkarni, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla</p>
            <p>The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of quantum systems subjected to a localized fermionic source in the presence of bulk dephasing. We consider two classes of one-dimensional lattice systems: (i) a non-interacting lattice with nearest-neighbor and beyond, i.e., long-ranged (power-law) hopping, and (ii) a lattice that is interacting via short-range interactions modeled by a fermionic quartic Hamiltonian. We study the evolution of the local density profile $n_i(t)$ within the system and the growth of the total particle number $N(t)$ in it. For case (i), we provide analytical insights into the dynamics of the nearest-neighbor model using an adiabatic approximation, which relies on assuming faster relaxation of coherences of the single particle density matrix. For case (ii), we perform numerical computations using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm and analyze the density profile and the growth exponent in $N(t)$. Our detailed study reveals an interesting interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and various environmentally induced mechanisms in open quantum systems, such as local source and bulk dephasing. It brings out rich dynamics, including universal dynamical scaling and anomalous behavior across various time scales and is of relevance to various quantum simulation platforms.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Materials for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Koehler, Akshata Sangle, Stefan M. Goetz</p>
            <p>Various coils for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are widely available for clinical and research use. These coils are almost all designed as air coils, which require large levels of energy to achieve a given magnetic flux density and in turn electric field strength, whereas in other sectors, such as power electronics or electrical machines, magnetic materials have been used for a long time to achieve higher efficiencies. We tested the impact on the electric and magnetic properties of different soft magnetic materials, including various ferrite cores, laminated sheet materials of nonisotropic corn-oriented silicon-steel, non-oriented silicon-steel, as well as cobalt-iron, and soft magnetic compound powder cores with insulated particles. Every material led to a reduction in coil current and voltage for the same target electric field strength. For the same field energy, every material yielded lower losses. Most common materials saturated already at very low currents. More material in thicker layers could shift the saturation point but at the cost of high weight. Due to their low saturation flux density, ferrites appear unsuitable for the high amplitude requirements of TMS. Laminated sheet materials and powder cores reduce the pulse energy, but the laminated sheet material adds more weight for the same effect than powder cores. Thus, appropriate magnetic materials can reduce the required pulse energy. Saturation flux density is the most relevant parameter, whereas the permeability beyond a certain base level is practically irrelevant. Most importantly, the weight of a magnetic-core coil may always be increased compared to an air coil for the same target field.</p>

            <p>We engineer lumped-element superconducting resonators that maximize magnetic coupling to molecular spin qubits, achieving record single-spin couplings up to 100 kHz and collective couplings exceeding 10 MHz. The resonators were made interact with PTMr organic free radicals, model spin systems with $S=1/2$ and a quasi-isotropic $g \simeq 2$, dispersed in polymer matrices. The highest collective spin-photon coupling strengths are attained with resonators having large inductors, which therefore interact with most spins in the molecular ensemble. By contrast, the coupling of each individual spin $G_{1}$ is maximized in resonators having a minimum size inductor, made of a single microwire. The same platform has been used to study spin relaxation and spin coherent dynamics in the dispersive regime, when spins are energetically detuned from the resonator. We find evidences for the Purcell effect, i.e. the photon induced relaxation of those spins that are most strongly coupled to the circuit. The rate of this process has been used to infer the distribution of single spin photon couplings in a given device. For resonators with a 50 nm wide constriction fabricated at the center of its single maximum $G_{1}$ values reach $\sim 100$ kHz. Pumping the spins with strong pulses fed through an independent transmission line induces coherent Rabi oscillations. The spin excitation then proceeds via either direct resonant processes induced by the main pulse frequency or, in the case of square-shaped pulses, via the excitation of the cavity by side frequency components. The latter process measures the cavity mode hybridization with the spins and can be eliminated by using Gaussian shaped pulses. These results establish a scalable route toward integrated molecular-spin quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Bone serves as a remarkable example of nature's architectured material with its unique blend of strength and toughness, all at a lightweight design. Given the hierarchical nature of these materials, it is essential to understand the governing mechanisms and organization of its constituents across length scales for bio-inspired structural design. Despite recent advances in transmission electron miscoscopy (TEM) that have allowed us to witness the fascinating arrangement of bone at micro- down to the nano-scale, we are still missing the details about the structural organization and mechanical properties of the main building blocks of bone - mineralized collagen fibrils (MCFs). Here, we propose a novel approach for extracting individual MCFs from nature's model material via a dropcasting procedure. By isolating the MCFs onto TEM-compatible substrates, we visualized the arrangement of organic and mineral phases within the individual MCFs at the nanoscale. Using a 4D-STEM approach, the orientation of individual mineral crystals within the MCFs was examined. Furthermore, we conducted first-of-its-kind in situ tensile experiments, revealing exceptional tensile strains of at least 8%, demonstrating the intricate relationship between structural organization and the mechanical behavior of MCFs. The capabilities of TEM allow us to resolve MCF organization and composition down to the nanoscale level. This new knowledge of the ultrastructure of the bone-building blocks and the proposed sample extraction and in situ mechanical testing opens up new avenues for research into nature's inspired material design.</p>

            <h2>Large deviations of spectral determinants of matrix-valued random Schrödinger operators and Dyson Brownian motion in cubic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yan Fyodorov, Pierre Le Doussal, Alexander Ossipov</p>
            <p>We study the moments of $\overline{|\det(H-E)|^q}$ and the associated large deviations of $\log |\det(H-E)|$ where $H$ are random matrix operators involving Laplace operators and random potentials. This includes as a special case Hessians of random elastic manifolds at a generic energy configuration. In one dimension $d=1$ these are $N \times N$ matrix valued random Schrödinger operators and $\log | \det(H-E) | $ is the sum of the $N$ associated Lyapunov exponents. Using a mapping to a stochastic matrix Ricatti equation we make a connection between the spectral properties of these operators and the total $N$ particle current of a Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) in a cubic potential. The latter model was studied by Allez and Dumaz [1] who showed that for $N=+\infty$ it exhibits a sharp transition between a phase with non-zero current and a confined (zero current) phase. We compute the barrier-crossing probability of the DBM at large but finite $N$, which gives an estimate of the exponential tail of the average density of states of a matrix Schrodinger operator below the edge of its spectrum. The barrier behaves as $\sim N (-E)^{3/2}$ at large negative energy and vanishes as $\sim N(E^*-E)^{5/4}$ near the edge. For $q=1$ the present work provides an independent derivation of the total complexity of stationary points for an elastic string embedded in $N$ dimension in presence of disorder.</p>

            <p>Distributed quantum computing offers a potential solution to the complexity of superconducting chip hardware layouts and error correction algorithms. High-quality gates between distributed chips enable the simplification of existing error correction algorithms. This article proposes and demonstrates a remote quantum geometric gate scheme via parametric modulation. Our scheme inherits the intrinsic robustness of geometric phases. Meanwhile, by employing gradient-based optimization algorithms(Adaptive Moment Estimation) from deep learning, we design control waveforms that significantly suppress population leakage. We experimentally realize the rapid remote SWAP and $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gates with high fidelity, completing operation in about 30 ns. The gate error of SWAP ($\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$) is 1.16\% (0.91\%) after excluding the effect of energy relaxation. The simulation demonstrate that this scheme can be implemented in the distributed chips connected by cables extending several meters. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in enabling modular quantum processors, offering a promising path toward the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <h2>2D or not 2D: a "holographic dictionary'' for Lowest Landau Levels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Mandal, Ajay Mohan, Rushikesh Suroshe</p>
            <p>We consider 2D fermions on a plane with a perpendicular magnetic field, described by Landau levels. It is wellknown that, semiclassically, restriction to the lowest Landau levels (LLL) implies two constraints on a 4D phase space, that transforms the 2D coordinate space (x,y) into a 2D phase space, thanks to the non-zero Dirac bracket between x and y. A naive application of Dirac's prescription of quantizing LLL in terms of L2 functions of x (or of y) fails because the wavefunctions are functions of x and y. We are able, however, to construct a 1D QM, sitting differently inside the 2D QM, which describes the LLL physics. The construction includes an exact 1D-2D correspondence between the fermion density \rho(x,y) and the Wigner distribution of the 1D QM. In a suitable large N limit, (a) the Wigner distribution is upper bounded by 1, since a phase space cell can have at most one fermion (Pauli exclusion principle) and (b) the 1D-2D correspondence becomes an identity transformation. (a) and (b) imply an upper bound for the fermion density \rho(x,y). We also explore the entanglement entropy (EE) of subregions of the 2D noncommutative space. It behaves differently from conventional 2D systems as well as conventional 1D systems, falling somewhere between the two. The main new feature of the EE, directly attributable to the noncommutative space, is the absence of a logarithmic dependence on the size of the entangling region, even though there is a Fermi surface. In this paper, instead of working directly with the Landau problem, we consider a more general problem, of 2D fermions in a rotating harmonic trap, which reduces to the Landau problem in a special limit. Among other consequences of the emergent 1D physics, we find that post-quench dynamics of the (generalized) LLL system is computed more simply in 1D terms, which is described by well-developed methods of 2D phase space hydrodynamics.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled systems, from synthetic nanostructures to developing organisms, are composed of fluctuating units capable of forming robust functional structures despite noise. In this Letter we ask: are there fundamental bounds on the robustness of self-organized nano-systems? By viewing self-organization as noisy encoding, we prove that the positional information capacity of short-range classical systems with discrete states obeys a bound reminiscent of area laws for quantum information. This universal bound can be saturated by fine-tuning transport coefficients. When long-range correlations are present, global constraints reduce the need for fine-tuning by providing effective integral feedback. Our work identifies bio-mimetic principles for the self-assembly of synthetic nanosystems and rationalizes, on purely information-theoretic grounds, why scale separation and hierarchical structures are common motifs in biology.</p>

            <p>Computational materials discovery relies on the generation of plausible crystal structures. The plausibility is typically judged through density functional theory methods which, while typically accurate at zero Kelvin, often favor low-energy structures that are not experimentally accessible. We develop a combined compositional and structural synthesizability score which provides an accurate way of predicting which compounds can actually be synthesized in a laboratory. We use it to evaluate non-synthesized structures from the Materials Project, GNoME, and Alexandria, and identified several hundred highly synthesizable candidates. We then predict synthesis pathways, conduct corresponding experiments, and characterize the products across 16 targets, successfully synthesizing 7 of 16. The entire experimental process was completed in only three days. Our results highlight omissions in lists of known synthesized structures, deliver insights into the practical utility of current materials databases, and showcase the central role synthesizability prediction can play in materials discovery.</p>

Despite extensive research, the upper limits of flow strength, the resistance to plastic flow, remain uncertain, and the mechanisms driving deformation at the relevant stresses are a subject of debate.

            <p>A supersolid is a quantum-entangled state of matter exhibiting the dual characteristics of superfluidity and solidity. Theory predicts that hard-core bosons with repulsive interactions on a triangular lattice can form supersolid phases at half filling and near complete filling. Leveraging an exact mapping between bosons and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ degrees of freedom, we investigate these phases in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet \K212 with exchange constants $J_z = 2.96(2)$~meV and $J_{\perp} = 0.21(3)$~meV. At zero field, neutron diffraction reveals the gradual development for $T<15$~K of quasi-two-dimensional $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ magnetic order with $Z_3$ translational symmetry breaking (solidity) albeit with 44(5)% reduced amplitude at $T=0.3$~K indicating strong quantum fluctuations. These are apparent in equidistant bands of continuum neutron scattering for $\hslash\omega_n\approx n\times J_z$, where $n=0,1,2,3$. The lowest energy ($n=0$) $\bf Q$-dependent continuum has a lower resonant edge and includes a quasi-elastic component at K $(\frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{3})$ consistent with broken $U(1)$ spin rotational symmetry (boson superfluidity). Competing instabilities are apparent in soft albeit finite-energy modes at M $(\frac{1}{2}0)$ and at $\frac{1}{2}$K $(\frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{6})$. For $\bf c$-axis-oriented magnetic fields $17~{\rm T} <\mu_0 H< 21~{\rm T}$ that almost saturate the magnetization, corresponding to nearly filling the lattice with bosons, we find a new phase consistent with a second supersolid. These phases are separated by a pronounced 1/3 magnetization plateau that supports coherent spin waves, from which we determine the spin Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Friedrich Hübner, Leonardo Biagetti, Jacopo De Nardis, Benjamin Doyon</p>
            <p>In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of ``diffusion from convection'' previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</p>

Our novel strong ECHP mechanism explains the entire phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, the duality of the spin gap and strange metal phase, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping and the rest of the overdoped regions of the superconducting (SC) dome, the presence of the parallel superconducting stripes in the CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and the linear-T behavior of the strange metal phase above the overdoped regions of the SC dome. This also explains the experimental spin textures of the cuprates. We refer to our new ECHP model as a resonating entanglement and confinement hole pair (RECHP) theory. Based on RECHP theory, we were able to provide a conceptual and comprehensive qualitative explanation of the entire phase diagram, thus providing the sought-after mechanism responsible for the entire phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates</p>

            <h2>Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Jonas Moser, Lukas Janssen</p>
            <p>A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Other possible realizations include kagome quantum magnets, quantum impurity models, and quantum chromodynamics with supplemental four-fermion interactions.</p>

            <p>Flat electronic bands strongly enhance Coulomb interactions and can stabilize unconventional insulating states. Motivated by the recent discovery of flat bands in breathing Kagome lattices, we use first-principles GW--Bethe--Salpeter theory to investigate the excitonic spectrum of single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$. We find a dark spin-triplet Frenkel exciton whose spectral peak lies at negative energy ($-0.14$~eV) relative to the quasiparticle gap, directly signaling a preformed bound state and an excitonic Mott insulating phase potentially stable at room temperature. Bright excitons appear at $0.94$~eV and $1.21$~eV, with ultra-large binding energies of $2.05$~eV and $1.77$~eV. By mapping the low-energy dynamics onto a spin-1 Hubbard model on a triangular lattice, we show that frustrated antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric tendencies naturally emerge. These results identify Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ as a candidate multiferroic dark excitonic insulator, opening a pathway to correlated quantum phases in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into alternative thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser-irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite-element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters.

            <h2>Interaction-induced reentrance of Bose glass and quench dynamics of Bose gases in twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Hao Ding, Li-Jun Lang, Qizhong Zhu, Liang He</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state and dynamical properties of ultracold Bose gases in optical lattices with a quasicrystal structure, inspired by recent experiments on twisted bilayer and quasicrystalline optical lattices. The interplay between on-site repulsive interactions and the quasiperiodic potential leads to rich physics. At low filling factors, increasing the interaction strength induces a delocalization effect that transforms a Bose-glass (BG) phase-characterized by disconnected superfluid (SF) regions-into a robust SF phase with a percolated network of SF clusters. This transition is quantitatively identified via the percolation probability. At higher filling factors, we uncover a reentrant behavior: with increasing interaction, the system first changes from BG to SF, but further strengthening reverses the trend, restoring the BG phase. This reentrance originates from an interaction-driven rearrangement of particles, where a percolated SF network fragments into isolated SF islands as repulsion dominates. The quench dynamics show distinct transient features: intraphase quenches cause minor variations in the percolation probability and the inverse participation ratio (IPR), while interphase quenches produce strong responses. In particular, an SF-to-BG quench exhibits an abrupt loss of global SF connectivity, whereas a BG-to-SF quench shows oscillatory percolation and a gradual IPR decrease, stabilizing the SF phase. These results elucidate the competition between quasiperiodicity and interactions in ultracold Bose gases and offer insights relevant to current experiments with twisted bilayer and quasicrystal optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Active wave-particle clusters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahil N. Valani, David M. Paganin</p>
            <p>Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of inertial active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and wave memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have previously been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. Inspired by the rich dynamics of strongly interacting superwalking droplets in experiments, we numerically investigate the dynamics of WPE clusters using a stroboscopic model. We find that several interacting WPEs self-organize into a stable bound cluster, reminiscent of an atomic nucleus. This active cluster exhibits a rich spectrum of collective excitations, including shape oscillations and chiral rotating modes, akin to vibrational and rotational modes of nuclear excitations, as the spatial extent of the waves and their temporal decay rate (memory) are varied. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective wave field potential, bearing qualitative similarities with the nuclear shell model and the bag model of hadrons. For high memory and rapid spatial decay of waves, the active cluster becomes unstable and disintegrates; however, within a narrow regime of the parameter space, the cluster ejects single particles whose decay statistics follow exponential laws, reminiscent of radioactive nuclear decay. Our study uncovers a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviors in clusters of active particles, opening new avenues for exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in active matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Is Herbertsmithite far from an ideal antiferromagnet? Ab-initio answer including in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and coupling with extra-plane impurities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flaurent Heully-Alary, Nadia Ben Amor, Nicolas Suaud, Laura Messio, Coen de Graaf, Nathalie Guihéry</p>
            <p>Herbertsmithite is known as the archetype of a S=1/2 nearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Kagomé lattice, theoretically presumed to be a quantum gapless spin liquid. However, more and more experiments reveal that the model suffers from deviations from the ideal one, evidenced at very low temperatures. This detailed ab initio study focuses on two such deviations that have never been quantitatively calculated: the anisotropic exchange interactions and the Heisenberg exchange with extra-plane magnetic impurities. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is found to have an in-plane component almost three times larger than the out-of-plane component, but typically obviated in theoretical studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a strong ferromagnetic interaction (minus half the main exchange $J_1$ ) with the Kagomé magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of $\sim15\%$, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.</p>

This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</p>

            <p>Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Stahl, Oliver Hart, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent advances in ultracold atomic gas experiments, we investigate a two-terminal mesoscopic system in which two-body loss occurs locally at the center of a one-dimensional chain. By means of the self-consistent Born approximation in the Keldysh formalism, we uncover mesoscopic current formulas that are experimentally relevant and applicable to the weak dissipation regime. Although these formulas are analogous to those for systems with one-body loss, it turns out that the channel transmittance and loss probability depend on the nonequilibrium occupation at the lossy site. We demonstrate that this occupation dependence leads to a weaker suppression of currents in the presence of two-body loss compared to one-body loss.</p>

            <p>Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. We propose a hitherto unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. We demonstrate these harmonic signals with semimetal WTe$_2$ in mind but the results are not restricted to specific materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacques K. Desmarais, Kamel Bencheikh, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis</p>
            <p>The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</p>

            <h2>Growth of Structural Lengthscale in Kob Andersen Binary Mixtures: Role of medium range order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanket Kumawat, Mohit Sharma, Ujjwal Kumar Nandi, Indrajit Tah, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya</p>
            <p>A central and extensively debated question in glass physics concerns whether a single, growing lengthscale fundamentally controls glassy dynamics, particularly in systems lacking obvious structural motifs like the Kob Andersen binary Lennard Jones (KALJ) model. In this work, we investigate structural and dynamical lengthscales in supercooled liquids using KALJ model in two compositions: 80:20 and 60:40. We compute the dynamical lengthscale from displacement displacement correlation functions and observe a consistent growth as temperature decreases. To explore the static counterpart, we use a structural order parameter (SOP) based on the mean field caging potential. While this SOP is known to predict short time dynamics effectively, its bare correlation function reveals minimal spatial growth. Motivated by recent findings that long time dynamics reflect collective rearrangements, we perform spatial coarse graining of the SOP and identify an optimal lengthscale Lmax that maximises structure dynamics correlation. We show that the structural correlation length derived from SOP coarse grained over Lmax exhibits clear growth with cooling and closely tracks the dynamical lengthscale, especially for A particles in the 80:20 mixture and for both A and B particles in the 60:40 system. Our results reconcile the previously observed absence of static length growth in the KALJ model by highlighting the necessity of intermediate range structural descriptors. Furthermore, we find that the particles with larger structural length growth also correspond to species with latent crystallisation tendencies, suggesting a possible link between structural order, dynamics, and incipient crystallisation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Coppola, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Zala Lenarčič</p>
            <p>The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo M. Blanco, Hedda H. Rønneberg, Rita S. Dias</p>
            <p>Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used as drug carriers in cancer therapy due to their ability to accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, their transport within tumors is often hindered by the dense extracellular matrix, where diffusion dominates. Several studies suggest that ultrasound (US) irradiation can enhance NP diffusion in ECM-mimicking hydrogels, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and experimental findings are often contradictory. Here, we use coarse-grained Langevin Dynamics simulations to investigate the conditions under which US can enhance NP diffusion in hydrogels. After validating our simulation framework against an exact analytical solution for NP motion under US in dilute buffer, we systematically explore NP diffusion in hydrogels with varying degrees of NP-network attraction. Our results reveal that acoustic enhancement arises from reduced contact time between NPs and the hydrogel matrix. This effect becomes significant only when NP-hydrogel interactions are sufficiently strong and US pulses are long enough to disrupt these interactions, following a "stick-and-release" mechanism. These findings reconcile previously conflicting experimental observations and explain why acoustic enhancement is observed in some studies but not others. Overall, our study provides a molecular-level explanation for US-enhanced NP diffusion in hydrogels and establishes design principles for optimizing therapeutic US protocols in drug delivery applications.</p>

            <h2>Nonextensive Thermodynamics of the Morse Oscillator: Signature and Solid State Application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arpita Goswami</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of a bound quantum system: the Morse oscillator within the framework of Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using the property of the bound spectrum (upper bound) of the Morse potential, limited by the bond dissociation energy, we analytically derive the generalized partition function. We present results for both the high- and low-temperature limits. We propose the effective number of accessible states as a measure of nonextensivity. The calculation shows that the nonextensive framework further restricts the number of accessible states. We also derive the generalized internal energy and entropy and examine their dependence on temperature and the nonextensivity parameter \( q \). Numerical results confirm the strong effect of nonextensive behavior in the low-temperature regime (precisely low to moderate temperature), where the ratio of generalized internal energy and internal energy calculated from the Boltzmann Gibbs (BG) formula develops a nontrivial dip structure for \( q < 1 \). Moreover, the generalized specific heat shows the Schottky-type anomaly. We extend our study by deriving the specific heat of solids with BG and Tsallis statistics using the anharmonic energy levels of the Morse oscillator. This study suggests that the Morse oscillator is a solvable and physically meaningful testing ground for exploring the thermodynamics of quantum systems driven by nonextensive statistics, with implications for the vibrational properties of the non-equilibrium molecular thermodynamics (especially diatomic molecules).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Xin Lin, Hsiu-Chuan Hsu</p>
            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions, respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and injection currents. In contrast, circularly polarized light can not induce shift or injection currents, as constrained by the three-fold rotation symmetry. Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of responses is shown in the Haldane model. Under linearly polarized light, shift current, allowed by time-reversal symmetry, flows perpendicularly to the injection current, allowed by $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry. Across the topological phase transition, the injection current does not change sign since the group velocity's sign remains unchanged. On the contrary, shift current shows a sign flip, as a result of band inversion. Furthermore, we calculate quantum geometry, including quantum metric and symplectic connection, to demonstrate the microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE. We found that the vector field of symplectic connection in the Brillouin zone possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase.</p>

            <p>Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1, 0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.</p>

NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate effectively in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point.

            <p>Understanding thermal and electrical transport in topological materials is essential for advancing their applications in quantum technologies and energy conversion. Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate phonon and charge transport in the prototypical nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. The results unveil that anharmonic phonon renormalization results in the pronounced softening of heat-carrying phonons and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). Crucially, anharmonic effects are found to noticeably weaken Zr-S interactions, triggering avoided-crossing behavior of low-frequency optical phonons. The combination of phonon softening and avoided crossing synergistically reduces phonon group velocities, yielding a 16\% suppression in $\kappa_{\rm L}$ along the $c$-axis at room temperature. Contrary to conventional metals, we discover that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity in ZrSiS is abnormally large, even dominating heat conduction along the $c$-axis. This unusual behavior results in a substantial deviation of the Lorenz number from the Sommerfeld value -- exceeding it by up to threefold -- thereby challenging the validation of standard Wiedemann-Franz law for thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, our calculations demonstrate that ZrSiS exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity, attributed to its topological electronic Dirac states that account for both high Fermi velocities and weak electron-phonon coupling. This study provides critical insights into the electrical and thermal transport mechanisms in ZrSiS and highlights the importance of anharmonic effects in the lattice dynamics and thermal transport of metallic materials.</p>

            <p>We study a binary Bose gas in a symmetric dual-core, pancake-shaped trap, modelled by two linearly coupled two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equations with Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. Two different cases are considered. First, we consider a spatially uniform condensate, where we identify the domains of parameters for macroscopic quantum tunnelling, self-trapping and localisation revivals. The analytical formulas for the Josephson frequencies in the zero- and $\pi$-phase modes are derived. As the total atom number varies, the system displays a rich bifurcation structure. In the zero-phase, two successive pitchfork bifurcations generate bistability and hysteresis, while the $\pi$-phase exhibits a single pitchfork bifurcation. The second case is when the quantum droplets are in a dual-core trap. Analytical predictions for the oscillation frequencies are derived via a variational approach for the coupled dynamics of quantum droplets, and direct numerical simulations validate the results. We identify critical values of the linear coupling that separate Josephson and self-trapped regimes as the particle number changes. We also found the Andreev-Bashkin superfluid drag effect in numerical simulations of the droplet-droplet interactions in the two-core geometry.</p>

            <p>Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has expanded rapidly to encompass a broad range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending the concept of HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), where non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order, despite reducing configurational entropy, create new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often surpassing those of higher-entropy counterparts. Along this line, several fundamental scientific questions arise. Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Should maximizing entropy always be the goal? In this perspective article, I revisit key concepts and terminologies and highlight emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. I propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with correlated disorder (coupled chemical and structural short-range order), offers an effective strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance.</p>

            <p>Accurate yet transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for accelerating materials and chemical discovery. However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.</p>

            <p>We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and $p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$.</p>

            <p>The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are dictated by their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). The absence of a predictive theory directly linking catalysts to the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific chiralities. Here we narrow this gap through a two-step approach. First, we derive a universal vector sum rule that quantifies the relationship between cap structure and chirality, demonstrating that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the vector sum of the six pentagon coordinates within the cap. The complete set of these coordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully defines the carbon cap structure. Building on this topological foundation, we establish that chirality is encoded deterministically at nucleation, as perturbations to pentagon positions lead to predictable, quantifiable, and kinetically irreversible shifts in (n,m). By examining existing experimental evidence, we further propose that the preferential formation of $(12,6)$ nanotubes arises from a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial matching to the <1,1,1> catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework that redefines the field, shifting the paradigm from stochastic growth kinetics to deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable synthesis.</p>

            <h2>Generative diffusion modeling protocols for improving the Kikuchi pattern indexing in electron back-scatter diffraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meghraj Prajapat, Alankar Alankar</p>
            <p>Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.</p>

            <h2>Spin glass phase at zero temperature in the Edwards-Anderson model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourav Chatterjee</p>
            <p>While the analysis of mean-field spin glass models has seen tremendous progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from physics. The fourth result is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like a power of the volume. The fifth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. Taken together, these results comprise the first mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.</p>

            <p>A shortcut-to-adiabatic protocol for the realization of a fast and high-fidelity controlled-phase gate in Rydberg atoms is developed. The adiabatic state transfer, driven in the high-blockade limit, is sped up by compensating nonadiabatic transitions via oscillating fields that mimic a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. High fidelities are obtained in wide parameter regions. The implementation of the bare effective counterdiabatic field, without original adiabatic pulses, enables to bypass gate errors produced by the accumulation of blockade-dependent dynamical phases, making the protocol efficient also at low blockade values. As an application toward quantum algorithms, how the fidelity of the gate impacts the efficiency of a minimal quantum-error correction circuit is analyzed.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Entanglement Phases with Bipartite Projected Ensembles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Yong Ge, Franco Nori</p>
            <p>We introduce bipartite projected ensembles (BPEs) for quantum many-body wave functions, which consist of pure states supported on two local subsystems, with each state associated with the outcome of a projective measurement of the complementary subsystem in a fixed local basis. We demonstrate that the corresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can effectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE converges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For critical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for area-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a disordered-ordered phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random Clifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that EAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils additional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and surface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to diagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement phase transitions. Moreover, given the accessibility of measuring EAE in quantum simulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.</p>

We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the noninvertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</p>

            <p>Recent experimental progress in controlling open quantum systems enables the pursuit of mixed-state nonequilibrium quantum phases. We investigate whether open quantum systems hosting mixed-state symmetry-protected topological states as steady states retain this property under symmetric perturbations. Focusing on the decohered cluster state -- a mixed-state symmetry-protected topological state protected by a combined strong and weak symmetry -- we construct a parent Lindbladian that hosts it as a steady state. This Lindbladian can be mapped onto exactly solvable reaction-diffusion dynamics, even in the presence of certain perturbations, allowing us to solve the parent Lindbladian in detail and reveal previously-unknown steady states. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that typical symmetric perturbations cause strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily small perturbations, destabilize the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order. However, when perturbations introduce only weak symmetry defects, the steady-state mixed-state symmetry-protected topological order remains stable. Additionally, we construct a quantum channel which replicates the essential physics of the Lindbladian and can be efficiently simulated using only Clifford gates, Pauli measurements, and feedback.</p>

            <p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p>

            <p>Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the Universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile.

In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.</p>

            <h2>Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Entao Yang, Ge Zhang</p>
            <p>Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</p>

            <p>The critical dynamics of conformal field theories on random surfaces is investigated beyond the previously studied dynamics of the overall area and the genus. It is found that the evolution of the order parameter in physical time performs a generalization of the multifractal random walk. Accordingly, the higher moments of time variations of the order parameter exhibit multifractal scaling. The series of Hurst exponents is computed and illustrated at the examples of the Ising-, 3-state-Potts-, and general minimal models as well as $c=1$ models on a random surface. It is noted that some of these models can replicate the observed multifractal scaling in financial markets.</p>

This unusual coexistence of universal and variable exponents offers a rare empirical testbed for nonequilibrium growth and an empirical basis for modeling urban sprawl.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ian T. Abrahams</p>
            <p>Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical FP time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</p>

            <p>The preparation procedures of materials are often embedded narratively in experimental protocols, research articles, patents, and laboratory notes, and are structured around procedural sequences, causal relationships, and conditional logic. The synthesis of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer composites exemplifies this linguistically encoded decision-making system, where the practical experiments involve interdependent multistage and path-dependent processes such as exfoliation, functionalization, and dispersion, each governed by heterogeneous parameters and contextual contingencies, challenging conventional numerical optimization paradigms for experiment design. We reformulate this challenge into a text-reasoning problem through a framework centered on a text-first, lightly structured materials database and large language models (LLMs) as text reasoning engines. We constructed a database that captures evidence-linked narrative excerpts from the literature while normalizing only the minimum necessary entities, attributes, and relations to enable composite retrieval that unifies semantic matching, lexical cues, and explicit value filters. Building on this language-native, provenance-preserving foundation, the LLM operates in two complementary modes: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), grounding outputs in retrieved evidence modules from the database, and experience-augmented reasoning (EAR), which leverages iteratively trained text guides derived from multi-source literature-based narrative data as external references to inform reasoning and decision-making. Applying this integration-and-reasoning framework, we demonstrate rapid, laboratory-scale optimization of BNNS preparation, highlighting how language-native data combined with LLM-based reasoning can significantly accelerate practical material preparation.</p>

            <p>We locate the phase-transition line for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere from a finite-size scaling analysis of its ground-state energy. Our strategy is to write the latter as $E_{GS}(N_m)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ \chi:=E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. Conformal perturbation theory predicts that around a CFT, $\chi= \chi_{\rm min} + \sum_i \lambda_i^2 N_m^{-\omega_i} + O(\lambda^3)$, where $\lambda_i$ are the couplings associated to perturbations of operators with dimension $\Delta_i$, and $\omega_i = d-\Delta_i$. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] and their sweet spot with good precision. Varying two coupling constants allows us to extract the correction-to-scaling exponent $\omega$ associated to the two leading scalars $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$. We find similar results when normalizing by the gap to the stress tensor $T$ or first parity-odd operator $\sigma$ instead of $E_0$.</p>

The simulation of thermal equilibrium in imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics. For reference, we demonstrate analytic continuation of the Drude model into the imaginary time and Matsubara series, showing perfect agreement with our data within ranges of finite temperatures and densities. Method parameters, such as the finite time-step and finite-size effects prove only modestly significant. Our method, here carefully validated against an exactly solvable reference, remains amenable to more interesting domains in higher-order optical response, quantum confinements and quantum statistical effects, and applications in plasmonics, heterogeneous plasmas and nonlinear optics, such as epsilon-near-zero materials.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical framework for investigating superconducting proximity effect in altermagnet (AM)-superconductor (SC) heterostructures. In general, AMs, characterized by vanishing net magnetization but spin-split electronic spectra, provide a promising platform for realizing unconventional magnetic phases. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave AM proximity coupled to a three dimensional ordinary $s$-wave SC. By integrating out the superconducting degrees of freedom, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that describes the proximity-induced modifications in the AM layer in the form of a self-energy. We then derive an effective Green's function to obtain the proximity-induced pairing amplitudes in the AM layer and classify the induced pairing amplitudes according to their parity, frequency, and spin. We find the presence of even-parity singlet and triplet pairing amplitudes in the AM layer. To achieve the odd-parity triplet components, important to realize topological superconductivity, we introduce a layer of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in the heterostructure. We analyse the band topology of this proximity-induced AM-RSOC layer and demonstrate the emergence of both weak and strong topological superconducting phases with edge-localized modes, characterized by winding number and Chern number. These findings highlight the role of AM-SC hybrid setup as a versatile platform for realizing odd-parity triplet pairings and engineering topological superconductivity in two-dimension.</p>

            <p>Symmetries strongly influence transport properties of quantum many-body systems, and can lead to deviations from the generic case of diffusion. In this work, we study the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking on the transport and its universal aspects in integrable chiral spin ladders. We observe that the infinite-temperature spin transport is superdiffusive with a dynamical critical exponent z = 3/2 matching the one of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, which also lacks the time reversal symmetry. However, we find that fluctuations of the net magnetization transfer deviate from the KPZ predictions. Moreover, the full probability distribution of the associated spin current obeys fluctuation symmetry despite broken time-reversal and space-reflection symmetries. To further investigate the role of conserved quantities, we introduce an integrable quantum circuit that shares the essential symmetries with the chiral ladder, and which exhibits analogous dynamical behaviour in the absence of energy conservation. Our work shows that time-reversal symmetry breaking is compatible with superdiffusion, but insufficient to stabilize the KPZ universality in integrable systems. This suggests that additional fundamental features are missing in order to identify the emergence of such dynamics in quantum matter.</p>

Previously thought to vanish in SG198, our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under experimentally feasible electric biases.</p>

            <p>Multiorbital Hubbard models with Hund coupling and crystal-field splitting exhibit an instability toward spin-triplet excitonic order in the parameter regime characterized by strong local spin fluctuations. Upon chemical doping, two distinct types of excitonic ferromagnetism have been reported. Using steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that photo-doped half-filled systems can host nonthermal counterparts of these excitonic phases and exhibit a rich phase diagram in the space of photo-doping and crystal field splitting. Photo-doping a spin-triplet excitonic insulator provides a route towards nonequilibrium control of magnetic order.</p>

            <p>Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Zitterbewegung Effect and Quantum Geometry in Non-Hermitian Exciton-Polariton Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yow-Ming Robin Hu, Elena A. Ostrovskaya, Eliezer Estrecho</p>
            <p>In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane effective field.</p>

            <h2>The microscopic origin of the Quantum Hall Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eugenio DelRe, Paolo Di Porto</p>
            <p>Topology is key in describing unconventional quantum phases of matter and devising robust quantum technology. Exactly how topology mixes with quantum mechanics remains largely unclear, as testified by the lack of a unifying microscopic theory for the ever-expanding and still puzzling transport behavior of electrons in the Quantum Hall Effect. Here we formulate a microscopic theory able to quantitatively describe the large wealth of Quantum Hall physics starting from one basic assumption, that the topological constraint in actual space leads to a superposition of states in the associated angular space. This allows us to identify the mechanism underlying quantum topology, single-particle wavefunction regularity in 3D, while many-body physics and disorder play no fundamental role. Our findings introduce a new far-reaching perspective in analyzing topological quantum systems and applications, such as topological quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Topological Superconductivity and Antiferromagnetic Correlated Insulators in Twisted Bilayer WSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuyi Tuo, Ming-Rui Li, Zhengzhi Wu, Wen Sun, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>Since the very recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers at filling $\nu=-1$, considerable interest has arisen in revealing its mechanism. In this paper, we developed a three-band tight-binding model with non-trivial band topology by direct Wannierization of the low-energy continuum model. Incorporating both onsite Hubbard repulsion and next-nearest-neighbor attraction, we then performed a mean-field analysis of the microscopic model and obtained a phase diagram qualitatively consistent with the experiment results. For zero or weak displacement field, the ground state is a Chern number $C=\pm 2$ topological superconductor in the Altland-Zirnbauer A-class (breaking time-reversal but preserving total $S_z$ symmetry) with inter-valley pairing dominant in $d_{xy}\pm id_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (mixing with a subdominant $p_x\mp i p_y$-wave) component. For a relatively strong displacement field, the ground state is a correlated insulator with the $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Our results provide new insights into the nature of the twisted WSe$_2$ systems and suggest the need for further theoretical and experimental explorations.</p>
