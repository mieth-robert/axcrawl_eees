            <h2>Many-body effects of two-level systems in superconducting qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshuah T. Heath, Alexander C. Tyner, Thue Christian Thann, Vincent P. Michal, Peter Krogstrup, Mark Kamper Svendsen, Alexander V. Balatsky</p>
            <p>Superconducting qubits are often adversely affected by two-level systems (TLSs) within the Josephson junction, which contribute to decoherence and subsequently limit the performance of the qubit. By treating the TLS as a soft (i.e., low-frequency) bosonic mode localized in real space, we find that a single TLS in either the amorphous oxide surface or the superconducting bulk may result in a localized "hot spot" of amplified Josephson energy. Such amplification is shown to have a non-negligible effect on the $T_1$ time of certain superconducting qubits, regardless of whether or not the TLS is on resonance with the qubit frequency. With this study, we identify sources of decoherence unique to the superconducting element of superconducting quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Power-law banded random matrix ensemble as a model for quantum many-body Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wouter Buijsman, Masudul Haque, Ivan M. Khaymovich</p>
            <p>Hamiltonians of one-dimensional, disordered single-particle systems with long-range hopping terms can naturally be modeled by power-law banded random matrices. In this picture, the phase diagram of a power-law banded random matrix ensemble show ergodic, weakly ergodic, multifractal, and localized phases. Motivated by recent developments on ergodicity breaking and localization in interacting quantum many-body systems, we explore many-body interpretations of the power-law banded random matrix ensemble. We discuss a number of ways to label the basis vectors with many-body configurations, and compare the physical properties of the resulting Hamiltonians. We characterize the scaling of the many-body eigenstate entanglement entropy with system size for the different labeling schemes and in each of the phases. Using a scaling analysis on the full sets of eigenstates, we subsequently provide a quantitative picture of the boundary between the different types of scaling behavior that we observe for the spectral-bulk and spectral-edge eigenstates.</p>

            <h2>Excitonic bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructure metasurfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Polina Pantyukhina, Andrey Bogdanov, Kirill Koshelev</p>
            <p>We investigate the formation of excitonic quasi-bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructures composed of two-dimensional excitonic layers and resonant dielectric metasurfaces. We begin our analysis with a simplified planar heterostructure slab model containing a vdW layer. We develop a theoretical framework based on the slab's Green function to describe the weak coupling between excitons and quasi-normal electromagnetic modes. We show that the exciton Purcell factor can be significantly suppressed when the exciton frequency matches a Fabry-Pérot mode and the vdW layer is positioned at the nodes of the mode's electric field. In this case, the suppression reaches its fundamental limit, which is defined exclusively by slab's permittivity. In heterostructure metasurfaces, a more substantial suppression can be achieved due to multiple interferences between Fabry-Pérot modes and guided-mode resonances with high quality factors. Numerical simulations confirm that the exciton radiative lifetime can be extended by over two orders of magnitude, demonstrating the formation of excitonic quasi-BICs and their potential for advancing quantum optics and information processing.</p>

            <h2>Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Ferrini, S.V. Koniakhin</p>
            <p>The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</p>

            <h2>Pressure-induced strange metal phase in a metallic kagome ferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Shen, Feng Du, Franziska Breitner, Victoria A. Ginga, Ece Uykur, Alexander A. Tsirlin, Philipp Gegenwart</p>
            <p>Strange metallicity with $T$-linear electrical resistance preceding high-$T_c$ superconductivity remains an enigmatic, yet crucial, signature of correlation physics. Using electrical transport and magnetization measurements up to 50 GPa, we show that such a strange-metal phase is formed in pressurized kagome ferromagnet CrNiAs. In contrast to other kagome materials, a linear suppression of the Curie temperature is found, with the ferromagnetic quantum critical point at $p_{\rm{c}} \approx 12.5$ GPa. Remarkably, from $p_{\rm{c}}$ up to the highest measured pressure, characteristic strange-metal behavior is observed, whereas magnetic field reinstates the Fermi liquid. Electronic structure calculations reveal robust weakly dispersive bands persisting unchanged beyond $p_{\rm{c}}$, possibly at the origin of the $T$-linear electrical resistance. This establishes pressurized kagome ferromagnets as an intriguing platform for strange-metal behavior.</p>

            <h2>Odd-parity altermagnetism through sublattice currents: From Haldane-Hubbard model to general bipartite lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Ping Lin</p>
            <p>We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in nonmagnetic crystal structures and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.</p>

            <h2>Persistent, controllable circulation of a polariton ring condensate</h2>

            <p>Persistent circulation is a canonical effect of superfluidity. In previous experiments, quantized circulation has been observed in polariton condensates, usually far from equilibrium, but persistent current in the absence of any stirring has not been seen. We report here the direct observation of persistent circulation of a polariton condensate with no driving force and with no observable change in time. We can cause the condensate to circulate in either direction on demand using a short laser pulse, after which the condensate continues to circulate for dozens to hundreds of rotations around a ring trap without any further stimulation. Our theoretical model successfully shows how the pulse, despite not carrying any angular momentum, causes the circulation.</p>

            <h2>Crystal valley Hall effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chao-Yang Tan, Ze-Feng Gao, Huan-Cheng Yang, Zheng-Xin Liu, Kai Liu, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu</p>
            <p>The time-reversal symmetry is thought to be a necessary condition for realizing valley Hall effect. If the time-reversal symmetry is broken, whether the valley Hall effect can be realized has not been explored. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$. Due to crystal symmetry required, the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry is called crystal vally Hall effect. In addition, under uniaxial strain, both monolayer Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$ can realize piezomagnetic effect. Under biaxial compressive stress, both monolayer Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$ will transform from altermagnetic semiconductor phase to bipolarized topological Weyl semimetal phase. Our work not only provides a new direction for exploring the novel valley Hall effect, but also provides a good platform for exploring altermagnetic semiconductors and altermagnetic topological phase transitions.</p>

            <h2>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan C. Petit, Saswati Ganguly, Matthias Sperl</p>
            <p>We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same packing fractions, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</p>

            <h2>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Qi Fang, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.</p>

            <h2>Purely Electronic Model for Exciton-Polaron Formation in Moiré Heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian Pichler, Mohammad Hafezi, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Understanding interactions between excitons and correlated electronic states presents a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics. Here, we introduce a purely electronic model for the formation of exciton-polarons in moiré lattices. Unlike conventional approaches that treat excitons as tightly-bound bosonic particles, our model considers only electronic degrees of freedom, describing excitons as electron-hole bound states. Our findings reveal a pronounced renormalization of the polaron mass as a function of electron density, particularly near correlated insulators, consistent with recent transport experiments. Additionally, we predict an observable sign change in the effective polaron mass when increasing the electron density that can be measured in Hall-type experiments. Our purely electronic model provides a unified framework to investigate the formation and renormalization of exciton-polarons in correlated states.</p>

            <h2>Robustness of Vacancy-Bound Non-Abelian Anyons in the Kitaev Model in a Magnetic Field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Xiao, Gonzalo Alvarez, Gábor Halász</p>
            <p>The search for non-Abelian anyons in quantum spin liquids (QSLs) is crucial for advancing fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In the exactly solvable Kitaev honeycomb model, nonmagnetic spin vacancies are known to bind emergent gauge fluxes of the QSL ground state, which in turn become non-Abelian anyons for an infinitesimal magnetic field. Here, we investigate how this approach for stabilizing non-Abelian anyons at spin vacancies extends to a finite magnetic field represented by a proper Zeeman term. Specifically, we use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations to compute the vacancy-anyon binding energy as a function of magnetic field for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev models. We find that, while the inclusion of the field weakens anyon binding in both cases, there is a pronounced difference in the finite-field behavior; the binding energy remains finite within the entire QSL phase for the FM Kitaev model but approaches zero already inside this phase for the AFM Kitaev model. To reliably compute a very small binding energy that is three orders of magnitude below the magnetic interaction strength, we also introduce a refined definition for the binding energy and an extrapolation scheme for its accurate extraction through exclusively ground-state properties using DMRG.</p>

            <h2>Majorana polarization in disordered heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubhanshu Karoliya, Sumanta Tewari, Gargee Sharma</p>
            <p>Recent studies propose Majorana polarization (MP) as a tool for identifying topological Majorana bound states (MBS). We analyze MP in two systems: a one-dimensional (1d) semiconducting nanowire and a finite-size graphene strip, both with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity-induced superconductivity, and disorder. While MP reflects topological features, it does not always distinguish true MBS from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or quasi-Majorana modes. True MBS are expected to satisfy $\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left} \cdot \mathcal{P}^\mathrm{right} \sim -1$, but two additional criteria - a topological bandgap and edge-localized wavefunctions - are also necessary for their identification and use in topological quantum computation (TQC). We highlight cases where the polarization product condition holds without meeting these extra requirements. In finite graphene strips, disorder blurs the complex topological phase diagram, with isolated regions showing $\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{right}\approx-\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left}$ and $|\mathcal{P}^\mathrm{left}|\gtrsim \frac{1}{2}$. Even here, MP alone cannot reliably distinguish true MBS from quasi-Majorana or trivial states. Robust MBS identification for TQC demands combining MP with energy spectra and wavefunction localization, especially in disordered systems.</p>

            <h2>Untwisted and Twisted Rényi Negativities: Toward a Rényi Proxy for Logarithmic Negativity in Fermionic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fo-Hong Wang, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for pure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, Rényi entanglement entropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic negativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct computation is often intractable, leaving Rényi negativity (RN) as the practical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into untwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic partial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true Rényi proxy for LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this question by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute both untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where non-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges: the singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large variance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted and twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we find that the twisted Rényi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law and decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR but consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only establishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent Rényi proxy for LN in fermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the stable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs. Our work lays the foundation for future studies of mixed-state entanglement in large-scale fermionic many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Andreev versus Tunneling Spectroscopy of Unconventional Flat Band Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayak Biswas, Saurav Suman, Mohit Randeria, Rajdeep Sensarma</p>
            <p>STM experiments in the tunneling and Andreev regimes on graphene-based moire superconductors (SC) show two distinct energy scales whose origin is mysterious. We express the conductance of a normal-SC interface in terms of Green's functions, which allows us to sharpen the issues in two ways. First, we show that the two distinct energy scales cannot be understood in terms of a pseudogap in tunneling and a superconducting gap in the Andreev spectra. Second, the large Fermi velocity vF mismatch between the STM tip and the at band SC renormalizes a transparent interface towards the tunneling regime, and the ballistic Andreev regime cannot be realized in moire SCs. We also discuss self energy corrections to vF that determines the conductance. Finally, we offer a resolution to these problems by modeling the Andreev experiment as a circular metallic disc embedded in an unconventional SC. We show that with strong vF mismatch the low bias conductance is dominated by Andreev bound states induced by the tip at the interface with the unconventional SC. The ABS give rise to the low energy scale seen in Andreev experiments, smaller than the SC gap in tunneling spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>BCS-like formula for $T_c$ does not necessarily imply BCS pairing mechanism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Wang, Andrey V. Chubukov</p>
            <p>In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</p>

            <h2>Effect of imaginary gauge on wave transport in driven-dissipative systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. Komis, K. G. Makris, K. Busch, R. El-Ganainy</p>
            <p>Wave transport in disordered media is a fundamental problem with direct implications in condensed matter, materials science, optics, atomic physics, and even biology. The majority of studies are focused on Hermitian systems to understand disorder-induced localization. However, recent studies of non-Hermitian disordered media have revealed unique behaviors, with a universal principle emerging that links the eigenvalue spectrum of the disordered Hamiltonian and its statistics with its transport properties. In this work we show that the situation can be very different in driven-dissipative lattices of cavities, where a uniform gain applied equally to all the components of the system can act as a knob for controlling the wave transport properties without altering the eigenvalue statistics of the underlying Hamiltonian. Our results open a new avenue for developing a deeper insight into the transport properties in disordered media and will aid in building new devices as well. Our work which is presented in the context of optics generalizes to any physical platforms where gain can be implemented. These include acoustics, electronics, and coupled quantum oscillators such as atoms, diamond centers and superconducting qubits.</p>

            <h2>Effect of the Coulomb repulsion and oxygen level on charge distribution and superconductivity in the Emery model for cuprates superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis-Bernard St-Cyr, David Sénéchal</p>
            <p>The Emery model (aka the three-band Hubbard model) offers a simplified description of the copper-oxide planes that form the building blocks of high-temperature superconductors. By contrast with the even simpler one-band Hubbard model, it differentiates between copper and oxygen orbitals and thus between oxygen occupation ($n_p$) and copper occupation ($n_d$). Here we demonstrate, using cluster dynamical mean field theory, how the two occupations are related to the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ on the copper orbital and to the energy difference $\epsilon_p$ between oxygen and copper orbitals. Since the occupations ($n_p$ and $n_d$) have been estimated from NMR for a few materials (LCO, YBCO and NCCO), this allows us to estimate the value of $U-\epsilon_p$ for these materials, within this model. We compute the density of states for these and the effect of $(U,\epsilon_p)$ on the $n_d$-$n_p$ curve, superconductivity, and antiferromagnetism.</p>

            <p>Moiré engineering offers new pathways for manipulating emergent states in twisted layered materials and lattice-mismatched heterostructures. With the key role of the geometry of the underlying lattice in mind, here we introduce the watermill lattice, a two-dimensional structure with low-energy states characterized by massless pseudospin-3/2 fermions with high winding numbers. Its twisted bilayer is shown to exhibit magic angles, where four isolated flat bands emerge around the Fermi level, featuring elevated Wilson-loop windings and enhanced quantum geometric effects, such as an increase in the ratio of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature to the mean-field critical temperature under a weak Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing. We discuss how the watermill lattice could be realized in the MXene and group-IV materials. Our study highlights the potential of exploiting lattice geometry in moiré engineering to uncover novel quantum phenomena and tailor emergent electronic properties in materials.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic phases and electron-phonon coupling in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Zhu, Bin Li, Yuxiang Fan, Chuanhui Yin, Junjie Zhai, Jie Cheng, Shengli Liu, Zhixiang Shi</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent reports of pressure-induced superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we present a comprehensive investigation into the structural, electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties of this compound across a pressure range of 0 to 29.5 GPa. DFT+U calculations reveal that the A-type antiferromagnetic ground state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ persists throughout the studied pressure range. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni-$d_{xy}$ and Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level in both the $Fmmm$ and $Amam$ phases of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Phonon dispersion calculations for the $Fmmm$ phase reveal no imaginary modes from 12 to 29.5 GPa, confirming its dynamical stability in this pressure range. The vibrational frequencies of O atoms are substantially higher than those of Ni and La atoms, primarily due to the lower mass of oxygen. At 29.5 GPa, the electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ for the $Fmmm$ phase is calculated to be 0.13. This small value suggests that conventional electron-phonon coupling is insufficient to explain the reported superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, indicating a potentially unconventional mechanism. The study offers nuanced, actionable insights that can strategically inform and direct subsequent experimental investigations into the design and optimization of nickel-based superconducting materials.</p>

            <p>The kagome lattice is a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. However, achieving a single-atomic-layer kagome lattice in elemental materials has remained a significant challenge. Here we introduce line-graph epitaxy, a novel approach that enables the synthesis of single-atomic-layer goldene with a kagome lattice. Through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS), alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we provide direct evidence of kagome goldene, which exhibits a flat band with a van Hove singularity approximately 1.1 eV below the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron correlation effects. Notably, the flat band breaks down at the zigzag edges of the goldene nanoflakes, underlining the role of edge effects. Additionally, our calculations reveal that weak interlayer interactions between goldene and the Au$_2$Ge substrate give rise to dual Dirac nodal lines due to a proximity effect. These findings offer a strategy for constructing elemental kagome lattices and provide a generalizable approach for fabricating and controlling line-graph materials. This work paves the way for exploring quantum phases driven by strong correlations and designing materials for quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Spin supercurrent in parity mixed superconductors with structural chirality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keito Hara, Youichi Yanase</p>
            <p>Chiral materials exhibit a spin filtering effect, so-called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). A recent observation of spin accumulation at the ends of a chiral-structured superconductor has opened up a new pathway for studying the CISS effect in superconductors. In chiral-structured superconductors, the admixture of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet order parameters significantly influences the properties of superconductivity. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between the superconducting order parameter and supercurrent-induced spin current, namely, the superconducting CISS effect. In weakly party-mixed superconductors, the spin current, which is predominantly temperature-independent, is carried by spin-polarized Cooper pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum. In contrast, in strongly party-mixed superconductors the temperature-dependent spin current is also carried by electrons with opposite momentum and antiparallel spins forming a Cooper pair. Chiral-structured superconductors will offer a novel platform for exploring the CISS effect and may provide deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms related to the parity-mixed order parameter.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Magnetization as the Origin of the Nonlinear Hall Effect and Its Implications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zesheng Zhang, Xin-Zhi Li, Wen-Yu He</p>
            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect is a new type of Hall effect that has recently attracted significant attention. For the physical origin of the nonlinear Hall effect, while orbital magnetization has long been hypothesized to underpin the nonlinear Hall effect, quantitative connections between the two remain elusive. Here, we resolve the problem by deriving the first explicit formula connecting the electric field induced orbital magnetization to the second order nonlinear Hall conductivity. Our theory reveals that the applied electric field plays dual roles in generating the nonlinear Hall effect: it first generates nonequlibrium orbital magnetization and subsequently perturbs the circulating edge states to produce transverse Hall voltage. Based on this scenario, we point out that in isotropic chiral metals of T and O point groups, although the nonlinear Hall response of a monochromatic linear polarized electric field is forced to vanish due to the crystalline symmetry, applying a non-collinear bichromatic electric field can give rise to a nonvanishing nonlinear Hall current that directly manifests the chiral correlation of the applied electric field. This discovery in isotropic chiral crystals enables us to incoporate both the nonlinear Hall effect and the circulat photo-galvanic effect into the framework of orbital magnetization.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, which exhibit the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, have attracted significant attention recently. Among them, ruthenium dioxide (RuO2), a prototypical altermagnet candidate, is under intensive debate on its magnetic order and altermagnetic characters. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial RuO2 thin films with various orientations and fabrication methods. By utilizing thermal spin injections from a ferrimagnetic insulator, we unambiguously reveal a negative spin Hall angle for RuO2, which is opposite to all the previous reports using ferromagnetic metals. Most importantly, we observe robust anisotropic spin-to-charge conversion in RuO2, with voltage ratios of 30% for the (100)- and (110)-orientations and 40% for the (101)-orientations. The ratio remains consistent across RuO2 films fabricated by sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and molecular-beam epitaxy. These results conclusively show a robust and anisotropic spin Hall effect in RuO2 with the absence of altermagnetic spin-splitting contributions. Our study provides crucial insights and advances the understanding of spin-to-charge conversions in emerging materials with low crystal symmetries.</p>

            <p>In this study, we perform a detailed investigation into the interplay between disorder-induced electron localization and long-range hopping amplitudes within the Selective Long-Range Tight-Binding Model (SLRTB). Through numerical simulations, we analyze the electronic properties of the system, with a focus on the participation ratio (PR), entanglement entropy (EE), energy spectrum, and the ratio of level spacings ($r_n$). Our results reveal a marked distinction between negative and positive long-range hopping amplitudes, manifesting in different electronic behaviors and transitions. Notably, we carry out a finite-size scaling analysis, identifying the critical point and exponents that characterize the system's behavior near the transition. The investigation highlights the role of gapless regions in shaping the system's PR, $r_n$, and EE, and the influence of disorder on these properties. The SLRTB model proves to be an effective framework for understanding the effects of disorder and long-range hopping on electron dynamics, offering valuable insights into localization and delocalization phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Topological Nature of Orbital Chern Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yueh-Ting Yao, Chia-Hung Chu, Arun Bansil, Hsin Lin, Tay-Rong Chang</p>
            <p>Ground state topologies in quantum materials have unveiled many unique topological phases with novel Hall responses. Recently, the orbital Hall effect in insulators has suggested the existence of orbital Chern insulators (OCIs) in which the orbital angular momentum drives the Hall response. Studies on OCIs, however, have so far been restricted to valley-locked or spinful systems, but candidate materials for systematic studies of OCIs are lacking. Here we discuss a framework for investigating OCIs using the feature-spectrum topology approach. To characterize the ground-state topology in the orbital degree of freedom, we introduce the orbital Chern number and orbital-feature Berry curvature and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence and orbital Hall response. We also uncover a parameter-driven topological phase transition, which would offer tunability of the OCIs. In this way, we identify monolayer blue-phosphorene (traditionally considered topologically trivial) as the primal 'hydrogen atom' of OCIs as a spinless, valley-free OCI material. Our study gives insight into the nature of orbital-driven topological phases and reveals a new facet of blue-phosphorene, and provides a new pathway for advancements in orbitronics and the discovery of novel topological materials.</p>

            <h2>Josephson diode effect with Andreev and Majorana bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sayan Mondal, Pei-Hao Fu, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>Superconductor-semiconductor hybrids are useful for realizing the Josephson diode effect, where nonreciprocity in the supercurrents occurs due to the interplay of the Josephson effect and applied magnetic fields. These junctions can host Andreev and Majorana states with the same ingredients, though their interplay with the Josephson diode effect is unclear. In this work, we consider short Josephson junctions based on superconductor-semiconductor systems under homogeneous Zeeman fields and investigate the Josephson diode effect in the presence of Andreev and Majorana states. Under generic conditions, the Zeeman field component parallel to the spin-orbit axis promotes an asymmetric low-energy energy spectrum as a function of the superconducting phase, which persists in the trivial and topological phases hosting Andreev and Majorana bound states, respectively. Interestingly, this asymmetry creates supercurrents that are not odd functions of the phase difference, leading to a nonreciprocal behaviour and the Josephson diode effect. We show that the Josephson diode effect is particularly promoted under the presence of both zero-energy Andreev and Majorana bound states, revealing that Josephson diodes can be realized in the trivial and topological phases of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. We then demonstrate that the Zeeman field evolution of the diode's efficiencies can map the topological phase transition and the formation of Majorana bound states via an oscillatory behavior that becomes more visible in long superconductors. While Josephson diodes generally exist in the trivial and topological phases of Josephson junctions, we discover that in the tunneling regime only a Josephson diode effect in the topological phase remains due to the finite contribution of Majorana bound states. Our findings clarify the Josephson diode effect and aid in realizing Majorana-only Josephson diodes.</p>

            <p>In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently become a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases. Using mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating phases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\delta = 0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\prime$ plane. We also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each metallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state numerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and peaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases identified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a narrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in understanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chunhe Li, Hongyi Bian, Zixiang Lin, Yi Man, Zijie Qu</p>
            <p>The movement of microorganisms near solid-liquid interfaces is a topic of significant scientific interest due to its relevance in various natural and industrial contexts, such as biofilm formation and marine biofouling. In this study, we investigate the swimming behavior of C. reinhardtii near a sinusoidal periodic microstructure (SPM). Using fluorescence microscopy and three-dimensional tracking, we observe that the swimming direction of C. reinhardtii is strongly influenced by the geometric constraints of the SPM. Our results show that cells tend to aggregate at the bottom of the SPM rather than the top, and exhibit a speed orientation tendency near the microstructure. We attribute this behavior to a combination of the "memory effect" and hydrodynamic attraction. By altering the shape of the periodic microstructure, we successfully achieve directed induction of cell swimming, which has potential applications in micro-nano robot control and biofouling prevention. This work provides new insights into the movement mechanisms of microorganisms near solid-liquid surfaces and highlights the potential for manipulating their behavior through microstructure design.</p>

            <h2>Multi-particle-collision simulation of heat transfer in low-dimensional fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rongxiang Luo, Stefano Lepri</p>
            <p>Simulation of transport properties of confined, low-dimensional fluids can be performed efficiently by means of Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics with suitable thermal-wall boundary conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method by studying dimensionality effects and size-dependence of thermal conduction, properties of crucial importance for understanding heat transfer at the micro-nanoscale. We provide a sound numerical evidence that the simple MPC fluid displays the features previously predicted from hydrodynamics of lattice systems: (1) in 1D, the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with the system size $L$ as $\kappa\sim L^{1/3}$ and its total heat current autocorrelation function $C(t)$ decays with the time $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-2/3}$; (2) in 2D, $\kappa$ diverges with $L$ as $\kappa\sim \mathrm{ln} (L)$ and its $C(t)$ decays with $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-1}$; (3) in 3D, its $\kappa$ is independent with $L$ and its $C(t)$ decays with $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-3/2}$. For weak interaction (the nearly integrable case) in 1D and 2D, there exists an intermediate regime of sizes where kinetic effects dominate and transport is diffusive before crossing over to expected anomalous regime. The crossover can be studied by decomposing the heat current in two contributions, which allows for a very accurate test of the predictions. In addition, we also show that upon increasing the aspect ratio of the system, there exists a dimensional crossover from 2D or 3D dimensional behavior to the 1D one. Finally, we show that an applied magnetic field renders the transport normal, indicating that pseudomomentum conservation is not sufficient for the anomalous heat conduction behavior to occur.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maciej Bazarnik, Anika Schlenhoff</p>
            <p>Spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy studies of image-potential states on Gr/Fe/Ir(111) show their sensitivity to the spatial variation of the Gr-Fe distance, and of the interfacial charge and spin transfer within the moiré unit cell. A stacking contrast between fcc and hcp sites, indistinguishable in the direct tunneling mode, is provided by the image-potential states in both resonant tunneling topography and spectroscopy images. The spin-polarized measurements reveal a site- and energy-dependent spin-polarization of the image-potential states that is mapped across the moiré unit cell with a spin contrast between hcp and fcc sites unobservable in direct tunneling mode. On the on-top sites, the lowest image-potential states are found to exhibit a high spin-polarization, in contrast to the electronic states around the Fermi energy evanescent into vacuum, and attributed to their interfacial character at the respective Gr-Fe distance. Since the physisorbed graphene is only weakly spin-polarized on these sites, image-potential states reflect the spin density at buried interfaces covered by non-magnetic passivation layers. The simultaneous imaging of structural, electronic and magnetic properties, both at the surface and the buried interface will prove invaluable in research of 2D hybrids and heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Artificial spin systems, sometimes referred to as artificial spin ices, are arrays of coupled nanoscale magnets that order according to the lattice geometry, nanomagnet shape and magnetic anisotropy. Here we characterize a family of artificial spin systems that are formed by placing arrays of out-of-plane nanomagnets on the vertices of the Archimedean lattices. On demagnetizing these nanomagnet arrays using a magnetic field protocol and subsequently imaging the magnetic configuration using magnetic force microscopy, we observe different types of magnetic order. We compare our experimental results with those predicted by Monte Carlo simulations to assign an effective temperature to each lattice. We find that, for all of the lattices, the assigned effective temperature is above the transition temperature. This reflects the difficulty of obtaining system-spanning order in lattices with out-of-plane nanomagnets. We consider to what extent further-neighbor interactions affect the phase diagram and spin-spin correlations in each lattice, illustrating our results with four example lattices. We can divide the lattices into three main categories: bipartite lattices that admit a perfect antiferromagnetic ground state, frustrated lattices where ordering proceeds via a single step, and frustrated lattices with two-step-ordering. Our work highlights the diversity of magnetic ordering that can be hosted in two-dimensional artificial spin systems with out-of-plane nanomagnets, and demonstrates the importance of including long-range interactions to explain the magnetic ordering. Such insights will be important for incorporating artificial spin systems into novel computing applications.</p>

            <p>Kramers degeneracy is one fundamental embodiment of the quantum mechanical nature of particles with half-integer spin under time reversal symmetry. Under the chiral and noncentrosymmetric achiral crystalline symmetries, Kramers degeneracy emerges respectively as topological quasiparticles of Weyl fermions and Kramers nodal lines, anchoring the Berry phase-related physics of electrons. However, an experimental demonstration for ideal Kramers nodal lines (KNLs) well isolated at the Fermi level is lacking. Here, we establish a class of noncentrosymmetric achiral intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors with large Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, represented by In$_x$TaS$_2$, to host an ideal KNL phase. We provide evidence from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with spin resolution, angle-dependent quantum oscillation (QO) measurements, and ab-initio calculations. Our work not only provides a realistic platform for realizing and tuning KNLs in layered materials, but also paves the way for exploring the interplay between KNLs and superconductivity, as well as applications pertaining to spintronics, valleytronics, and nonlinear transport.</p>

            <p>It has recently been proposed that all achiral non-centrosymmetric crystals host so-called Kramers nodal lines, which are doubly degenerate band crossings connecting time-reversal invariant momenta in the Brillouin zone that arise due to spin-orbit coupling. When Kramers nodal lines intersect the Fermi level, they form exotic three-dimensional Fermi surfaces which is certain configurations can be fully described by two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. These Fermi surfaces are predicted to realize a quantized optical conductivity with multiple quantized levels a large light- and field-induced anomalous Hall effect. However, until now, no Kramers nodal line metal with such unconventional Fermi surfaces has been experimentally observed. Here, we extend the search for Kramers nodal line metals beyond the previously considered case in which the Fermi surfaces enclose a single time-reversal invariant momentum. Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and ab-initio calculations, we present evidence that the 3R polytypes of TaS$_2$ and NbS$_2$ are Kramers nodal line metals with open Octdong and Spindle-torus Fermi surfaces, respectively. We show that by reducing the band filling, a transition between these two configurations can be observed. Moreover, our data suggests a naturally occurring size quantization effect of inclusions of 3R-TaS$_2$ in commercially available 2H-TaS$_2$ crystals, which could enable the observation of quantized optical conductivity. Finally, since the open Fermi-surfaces encircle two time-reversal invariant momenta each, we predict a phase transition from a Kramers nodal line metal to a conventional metal by strain or uniaxial pressure. Our work establishes the 3R phase of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides as a tunable platform to explore new phenomena expected from exotic Fermi surfaces in Kramers nodal line metals.</p>

            <p>Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key enablers of spintronic technologies used in a variety of applications including information storage, microwave generation and detection, as well as unconventional computing. Here, we present experimental and theoretical studies of quantized spin wave eigenmodes in perpendicular MTJs focusing on a coupled magnetization dynamics in the free (FL) and reference (RL) layers of the MTJ, where the RL is a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF). Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements reveal excitation of two spin wave eigenmodes in response to applied microwave current. These modes show opposite frequency shifts as a function of out-of-plane magnetic field. Our micromagnetic simulations accurately reproduce the dependence of the mode frequencies on magnetic field and reveal the spatial profiles of the excitations in the FL and RL. The FL and RL modes generate rectified voltage signals of opposite polarity, which makes this device a promising candidate for a tunable dual-frequency microwave signal detector. The simulations show that weak interlayer exchange coupling within the SAF enhances the mode amplitudes. We also calculate the response of the detector as a function of in-plane magnetic field bias and find that its sensitivity significantly increases with increasing field. We experimentally confirm this prediction via ST-FMR measurements as a function of in-plane magnetic field. Our results provide deeper understanding of quantized spin wave eigenmodes in nanoscale MTJs with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and demonstrate the potential of these devices for frequency-selective dual-channel microwave signal detectors.</p>

            <p>Due to their photonic components, exciton-polariton systems provide a convenient platform to study the coherence properties of weakly-interacting Bose gases and the Bose-Einstein condensate transition. In particular, optical interferometry enables the measurement of the first-order coherence function which provides insight into the phase of the system. In this paper, we analyze the buildup of coherence in finite-sized, noninteracting, equilibrium Bose gases through the condensate fraction and the related coherent fraction, defined via the first-order coherence function. Our results provide a baseline to compare against experimental data. Discrepancies may indicate where interacting or nonequilibrium models are necessary to describe the system. In the normal phase, before the Bose-Einstein condensate transition, Bose gases exhibit partial spatial and temporal coherence. This significantly alters the paraxial propagation and interference of optical signals from exciton-polariton systems. Therefore, we also analyze diffraction related to the introduction of apertures and time-delay between interferometry arms, given the partial coherence of the source. Comparison to experiment shows remarkable agreement with the noninteracting Bose gas theory, even approaching the quasi-condensate regime.</p>

We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into a phase diagram with local spin moment as a parameter, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism (SDW/AFM), superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished surprisingly. At last, we predict a promising candidate of superconducting RP nickelate, which is constructed in a ``bilayer-trilayer'' stacking sequence.</p>

            <p>Ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have emerged as a scalable and promising platform for quantum simulation and computation. However, gate speeds remain a significant limitation for practical applications. In this work, we employ quantum optimal control to design fast, collision-based two-qubit gates within a superlattice based on a Fermi-Hubbard description, reaching errors in the range of $10^{-3}$ for realistic parameters. Numerically optimizing the lattice depths and the scattering length, we effectively manipulate hopping and interaction strengths intrinsic to the Fermi-Hubbard model. Our results provide five times shorter gate durations by allowing for higher energy bands in the optimization, suggesting that standard modeling with a two-band Fermi-Hubbard model is insufficient for describing the dynamics of fast gates and we find that four to six bands are required. Additionally, we achieve non-adiabatic gates by employing time-dependent lattice depths rather than using only fixed depths. The optimized control pulses not only maintain high efficacy in the presence of laser intensity and phase noise but also result in negligible inter-well couplings.</p>

            <h2>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Vikram</p>
            <p>Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</p>

            <h2>Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Qi Fang, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.</p>

            <h2>Non-positive energy quasidistributions in coherent collision models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco Pezzutto, Gabriele De Chiara, Stefano Gherardini</p>
            <p>We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</p>

            <p>We show that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality provides a simple yet general bound that limits the accuracy of light-matter theories which retain only finite numbers of material energy levels. A corollary is that unitary rotations within a truncated space cannot transform between gauges, because the contrary assumption yields incorrect predictions. In particular, a widespread model obtained using such a rotation and treated as a Coulomb gauge model within a substantial body of literature, yields incorrect predictions under this assumption.

            <p>In this study, we investigate the optical absorption within the conduction-subbands of a cylindrical GaN/AlN quantum wire. We analyze the optical absorption rate and the real part of the dielectric function for both quantum wire (QWR) and quantum dot (QD) structures in the presence of donor-impurity states. The results cover that the density of states associated with free motion in the QWR structure leads to a lower optical absorption compared to the QDs, as evidenced by the optical spectra. This study advances the understanding of GaN/AlN heterostructures by offering a comprehensive analysis of the optical properties of QWRs and QDs, especially under donor-doping situation. As a result, the outcomes provide a clear evidence of the effect of semiconductor nanostructures on the optical properties of optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the significance of active mechanical metamaterials capable of being remotely manipulated through changes in external stimuli. While research in this area has achieved considerable success in controlling reconfiguration to induce shape morphing or alter static mechanical properties, the active control of wave propagation within these systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a magneto-mechanical metamaterial that can be entirely governed by adjusting the magnitude and direction of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that such a system offers remote control over its Poisson's ratio, allowing for transitions from strongly auxetic to positive Poisson's ratio configurations. Additionally, our system enables manipulation of the phononic band structure, facilitating the formation of complete band gaps across different frequency ranges depending on the stage of the magnetically guided reconfiguration process. The potential for achieving such active control over the properties and behavior of these materials holds great promise for various applications, including robotics and smart vibration dampers that can be remotely controlled.</p>

            <p>Chaos is ubiquitous in high-dimensional neural dynamics. A strong chaotic fluctuation may be harmful to information processing. A traditional way to mitigate this issue is to introduce Hebbian plasticity, which can stabilize the dynamics. Here, we introduce another distinct way without synaptic plasticity. An Onsager reaction term due to the feedback of the neuron itself is added to the vanilla recurrent dynamics, making the driving force a gradient form. The original unstable fixed points supporting the chaotic fluctuation can then be approached by further decreasing the kinetic energy of the dynamics. We show that this freezing effect also holds in more biologically realistic networks, such as those composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The gradient dynamics are also useful for computational tasks such as recalling or predicting external time-dependent stimuli.</p>

            <p>Rayleigh-B{é}nard convection is investigated with sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$) in the vicinity of its critical point. In the supercritical domain, direct measurements of the heat flux $Q$ as a function of the temperature difference $\Delta T$ are consistent with the usual scaling laws of single-phase turbulent convection. Along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve, heat fluxes are dramatically enhanced by condensation and boiling. Optical measurements are performed to document the size and velocity of the bubbles. We report $Q(\Delta T, \epsilon)$ in both domains, with $\epsilon$ the dimensionless distance to the critical point. Critical scaling laws are observed that can guide the development of theoretical models. In addition, this documents a system of diverging heat transfer coefficient, i.e., in which a significant heat flux can be achieved with an arbitrarily small temperature difference as $\epsilon\to 0$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denan Li, Jiyuan Yang, Xiangkai Chen, Lintao Yu, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, particularly in computational materials science, by enabling more accurate and efficient simulations. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering quantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. This Perspective evaluates the viability of universal MLFFs for simulating complex materials systems from the standpoint of a potential practitioner. Using the temperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of PbTiO$_3$ as a benchmark, we assess leading universal force fields, including CHGNet, MACE, M3GNet, and GPTFF, alongside specialized models like UniPero. While universal MLFFs trained on PBE-derived datasets perform well in predicting equilibrium properties, they largely fail to capture realistic finite-temperature phase transitions under constant-pressure MD, often exhibiting unphysical instabilities. These shortcomings stem from inherited biases in exchange-correlation functionals and limited generalization to anharmonic interactions governing dynamic behavior. However, fine-tuning universal models or employing system-specific MLFFs like UniPero successfully restores predictive accuracy. We advocates for hybrid approaches combining universal pretraining with targeted optimization, improved error quantification frameworks, and community-driven benchmarks to advance MLFFs as robust tools for computational materials discovery.</p>

            <p>Magnetic materials are crucial in nonreciprocal electromagnetic devices, such as isolators, circulators, and nonreciprocal phase shifters. However, their use is often limited by the need for a uniform bias magnetic field and nonuniform demagnetizing fields, resulting in the restricted aperture of free-space devices, poor temperature stability, and incompatibility with magnetic field-sensitive applications. Alternative methods have been developed to achieve nonreciprocity using active, nonlinear, and time-varying metamaterials, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here, we present a new approach based on self-biased gyrotropic metamaterials composed of magnetically hard magnets (specifically NdFeB) embedded in a magnetically soft ferrite matrix. In this configuration, the NdFeB magnets provide the magnetic bias for the ferrite matrix, which produces a nonreciprocal response. This gyrotropic metamaterial can exhibit zero net magnetization while producing strong and uniform Faraday rotation over a broad temperature range. Without bias and demagnetizing fields, the aperture of this Faraday rotator can be virtually unlimited. Using this method, we demonstrate uniform 45-degree Faraday rotation and effective isolation across the microwave X-band.</p>

            <p>We present a geometrical construction of driven quantum systems, in which the position of a classical particle moving autonomously on a smooth connected manifold is used to steer a quantum Hamiltonian over time. This results in a time-dependent quantum Hamiltonian with a structured temporal profile and properties dependent on the local and global nature of the underlying choice of manifold. We explain how our construction recovers the well-known classes of periodically-driven and quasiperiodically-driven quantum systems, but also unveils fundamentally novel classes of quantum dynamics: by steering a quantum Hamiltonian using a classical particle freely moving on a compact 2d hyperbolic Riemann surface called the Bolza surface, we demonstrate an example of a hyperbolically driven quantum system. We show that fully gapped hyperbolically driven quantum systems in the adiabatic limit are topologically classified by a quantized dynamical response. We propose geometric quantum driving to be a general framework to chart the landscape of time-dependent quantum systems, which can be realized with time-dependent controls available in modern day quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>While machine learning algorithms have been shown to excel at specific chemical tasks, they have struggled to capture the strategic thinking that characterizes expert chemical reasoning, limiting their widespread adoption. Here we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can serve as powerful chemical reasoning engines when integrated with traditional search algorithms, enabling a new approach to computer-aided chemistry that mirrors human expert thinking. Rather than using LLMs to directly manipulate chemical structures, we leverage their ability to evaluate chemical strategies and guide search algorithms toward chemically meaningful solutions. We demonstrate this paradigm through two fundamental challenges: strategy-aware retrosynthetic planning and mechanism elucidation. In retrosynthetic planning, our method allows chemists to specify desired synthetic strategies in natural language to find routes that satisfy these constraints in vast searches. In mechanism elucidation, LLMs guide the search for plausible reaction mechanisms by combining chemical principles with systematic exploration. Our approach shows strong performance across diverse chemical tasks, with larger models demonstrating increasingly sophisticated chemical reasoning. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for computer-aided chemistry that combines the strategic understanding of LLMs with the precision of traditional chemical tools, opening possibilities for more intuitive and powerful chemical reasoning systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue-Feng Pan, Peng-Bo Li</p>
            <p>Coherent nonlinear tripartite interactions are critical for advancing quantum simulation and information processing in hybrid quantum systems, yet they remain experimentally challenging and still evade comprehensive exploration. Here, we predict a nonlinear tripartite coupling mechanism in a hybrid setup comprising a single electron trapped on a solid neon surface and a nearby micromagnet. The tripartite coupling here leverages the electron's intrinsic charge (motional) and spin degrees of freedom interacting with the magnon modes of the micromagnet. Thanks to the large spatial extent of the electron zero-point motion, we show that it is possible to obtain a tunable and strong spin-magnon-motion coupling at the single quantum level, with two phonons simultaneously interacting with a single spin and magnon excitation. This enables, for example, dissipative interactions between the electron's charge and spin degrees of freedom, permitting controlled phonon addition/subtraction in the electron's motional state and the preparation of steady-state non-Gaussian motional states. This protocol can be readily implemented with the well-developed techniques in electron traps and may open new avenues for general applications in quantum simulations and information processing based on strongly coupled hybrid quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer Rényi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
            <p>Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at this https URL.</p>

Motivated by recent experiments in kagome metals, we study a Hubbard model on a kagome lattice whose noninteracting limit contains flat bands.

These compact molecular orbitals represent the local degrees of freedom that emerge from topological flat bands. We identify a quantum critical point at which quasiparticles are lost and strange metallicity emerges. Our theoretical work opens up a new route for realizing beyond-Landau quantum criticality, as well as the associated strange metallicity and emergent quantum phases.</p>

            <p>Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, be useful for different applications due to a possible response being different from that occurring when the external stimulus affects the whole solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices form a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, supportive to the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it reveals unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Based on high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 15 X-type AFM candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative example, we predict the sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type AFM stacking, where one magnetic sublattice is conducting, while the other is not. As a result, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the Nèel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM domains. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, first proposed in the Haldane model, is a paradigmatic example of the application of band topology in condensed matter physics. The recent experimental discoveries of high Chern number QAH effect in pentalayer and tetralayer rhombohedral graphene highlight the intriguing interplay between strong interactions and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we propose a minimal interacting model for spin-orbit-coupled rhombohedral graphene and use the Hartree-Fock analysis to explore the phase diagram at charge neutrality. We find that with Ising SOC on one outmost graphene layer, the in-plane layer-antiferromagnetic order is the insulating ground state without displacement field. Upon increasing the gate displacement field, we find that the QAH state with Chern number being equal to the layer number emerges between layer-antiferromagnetic state and layer-polarized state, which is consistent with experimental observations. Remarkably, we study the phase diagram for different thicknesses and find pentalayer is optimal for the QAH effect. Finally, we propose that the QAH state is enlarged by engineering opposite Ising SOC on the opposite outmost layers of rhombohedral graphene. These results will facilitate the realization of QAH states in rhombohedral graphene with different thicknesses. Our work serves as a foundation for further exploration of correlated physics of insulating state in rhombohedral graphene.</p>

            <p>We study the tagged particle dynamics in a harmonic chain of direction reversing active Brownian particles, with spring constant $k$, rotation diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{r}}$, and directional reversal rate $\gamma$. We exactly compute the tagged particle position variance for quenched and annealed initial orientations of the particles. For well-separated time scales, $k^{-1}$, $D_{\text{r}}^{-1}$ and $\gamma^{-1}$, the strength of spring constant $k$ relative to $D_{\text{r}}$ and $\gamma$ gives rise to different coupling limits and for each coupling limit there are short, intermediate, and long time regimes. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that, to the leading order, the tagged particle variance exhibits an algebraic growth $t^{\nu}$, where the value of the exponent $\nu$ depends on the specific regime. For a quenched initial orientation, the exponent $\nu$ crosses over from $3$ to $1/2$, via intermediate values $5/2$ or $1$, depending on the specific coupling limits. On the other hand, for the annealed initial orientation, $\nu$ crosses over from $2$ to $1/2$ via an intermediate value $3/2$ or $1$ for strong coupling limit and weak coupling limit respectively. An additional time scale $t_N=N^2/k$ emerges for a system with a finite number of oscillators $N$. We show that the behavior of the tagged particle variance across $t_N$ can be expressed in terms of a crossover scaling function, which we find exactly. Finally, we characterize the stationary state behavior of the separation between two consecutive particles by calculating the corresponding spatio-temporal correlation function.</p>

            <p>We study the emergence of typicality in classical systems with a large number of binary state variables. We show analytically that for sufficiently large subsets of the complete state space, state functions which can be associated with macroscopic observables, such as density or energy, are sharply concentrated around a typical value, i.e., the vast majority of microscopic states show the same macroscopic behavior. From this static typicality result we obtain the dynamical counterpart, which states that if two initial conditions are drawn from a sufficiently large subset of the state space, the dynamical trajectories of the macroscopic observables would be approximately the same, provided that the dynamics does not compress abruptly the size of sets of states under evolution. The ensuing dynamical typicality phenomenon is very similar to what was recently found in the context of the dynamics of isolated quantum systems. We illustrate and apply our analytical results by analyzing one-dimensional cellular automata.</p>

For quasi-one dimension and higher, stability analysis of the noiseless hydrodynamics gives quantitative bounds on the phase boundary of the motility-induced phase separation in terms of spinodal and binodal. Inclusion of the multiplicative noise in the fluctuating hydrodynamics describes the exponentially decaying two-point correlations in the stationary-state homogeneous phase. Our hydrodynamic description and theoretical predictions based on it are in excellent agreement with our Monte Carlo simulations and pseudospectral iteration of the hydrodynamics equations. Our construction of hydrodynamics for this model is not suitable in strictly one-dimension with single-file constraints, and we argue that this breakdown is associated with micro-phase separation.</p>

            <p>The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively.

Beginning with simple product states, the system evolves into long-time stationary states with high energy that are nonthermal for a wide range of parameters, and they exhibit nonlocal string correlation that is characteristic of the symmetry-protected topological ground state of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, no topological feature is found in the stationary state as long as the system thermalizes. This difference is further corroborated by the distinct behaviour of quantum entanglement and edge states of the system. Our theoretical prediction can be examined by current experimental techniques and paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of topological phases in nonequilibrium settings.</p>

            <p>We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</p>

            <p>We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.</p>

            <h2>Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arabinda Bera, Alessio Zaccone, Matteo Baggioli</p>
            <p>The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements (``soft spots''). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Contrary to the 2D case, the sign of the topological charge defined from the eigenvector field is ambiguous and the geometry of the topological defects, whether radial or hyperbolic, plays a fundamental role in 3D. In fact, we find that the topological hedgehog defects relevant for plasticity are those exhibiting hyperbolic geometry, resembling the saddle-point structure of 2D topological defects with negative winding number (anti-vortices). Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.</p>

Notably, we uncover a novel regime where Floquet Weyl bands emerge and transition into Type-II Weyl states as the wave speed nears the Fermi velocity. Using Floquet-Bloch theory, we demonstrate that Lorentz contraction strongly amplifies Floquet band modulation effects, leading to a shockwave-like state synchronized with the wave motion.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ji-Lu He, Sebastian Eggert, Haiqing Lin, Xiaoqun Wang, Shi-Jie Hu</p>
            <p>The spin-$3/2$ chain is a versatile prototypical platform for the study of competition between different kinds of magnetic orders, with the objective of obtaining a deeper understanding of the corresponding quantum phase transitions. In this work, we investigate the spin-$3/2$ chain with nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy $D$ terms in the absence of a magnetic field. For positive values of $J_2/J_1$ and $D/J_1$, we find seven different phases in a rich phase diagram. Without frustration $J_2=0$, a gapless Luttinger liquid phase remains stable for all $D>0$. As $J_2$ increases, we observe three phases with distinct dimerized valence bond orders, which show an intricate competition with vector chiral order and incommensurate correlations. For large $J_2$, regions of phase coexistence between the dimerized and vector chiral orders emerge. We present large-scale numerical data for the determination of transition lines, order parameters, and the nature of the phase transitions.</p>

            <p>Supersymmetry is an algebraic property of a quantum Hamiltonian that, by giving every boson a fermionic superpartner and vice versa, may underpin physics beyond the Standard Model. Fractional bosonic and fermionic quasiparticles are familiar in condensed matter, as in the spin and charge excitations of the $t$-$J$ model describing electron dynamics in one-dimensional materials, but this type of symmetry is almost unknown. However, the triplet excitations of a quantum spin ladder in an applied magnetic field provide a supersymmetric analogue of the $t$-$J$ chain. Here we perform neutron spectroscopy on the spin-ladder compounds (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuCl$_4$ over a range of applied fields and temperatures, and apply matrix-product-state methods to the ladder and equivalent chain models. From the momentum-resolved dynamics of a single charge-like excitation in a bath of fractional spins, we find essential differences in thermal broadening between the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric sectors. The persistence of a strict zone-centre pole at all temperatures constitutes an observable consequence of supersymmetry that marks the beginning of supersymmetric studies in experimental condensed matter.</p>

            <p>While $U$(1) spin liquids have been extensively studied in both quantum and classical regimes, exact classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids arising from models with nearest-neighbor, bilinear spin interactions are still rare. In this Letter, we explore the four-color Kitaev model as a minimal model for stabilizing classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids across a broad family of tricoordinated lattices. By formulating a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, we identify this spin liquid as being described by an emergent Gauss's law with effective charge-2 condensation, and deconfined fractionalized bond-charge excitations. We complement our findings with Monte Carlo simulations, revealing a crossover from a high-temperature paramagnet to a low-temperature liquid phase characterized by residual entropy, classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux order, and diffuse spin structure factors.</p>

            <p>We consider the set of solutions to $M$ random polynomial equations whose $N$ variables are restricted to the $(N-1)$-sphere. Each equation has independent Gaussian coefficients and a target value $V_0$. When solutions exist, they form a manifold. We compute the average Euler characteristic of this manifold in the limit of large $N$, and find different behavior depending on the target value $V_0$, the ratio $\alpha=M/N$, and the variances of the coefficients. We divide this behavior into five phases with different implications for the topology of the solution manifold. When $M=1$ there is a correspondence between this problem and level sets of the energy in the spherical spin glasses. We conjecture that the transition energy dividing two of the topological phases corresponds to the energy asymptotically reached by gradient descent from a random initial condition, possibly resolving an open problem in out-of-equilibrium dynamics. However, the quality of the available data leaves the question open for now.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leora Schein-Lubomirsky, Yarden Mazor, Rainer Stöhr, Andrej Denisenko, Amit Finkler</p>
            <p>Nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (nanoMRI) aims at obtaining structure at the single molecule level. Most of the techniques for effecting a nanoMRI gradient use small permanent magnets. Here, we present a switchable magnetic field gradient on a tip, which is designed to provide a local and controllable magnetic field with a high gradient on the nanometer scale. We incorporate the gradient field with a nanoscale magnetic resonance sensor, a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, to provide high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The device is a metal microwire deposited along a quartz tip, with the current flowing along the tip inducing a magnetic field around its apex. This field can be manipulated throughout a measurement by controlling the current along the wire. We achieved gradients as high as 1 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T/nm}$ at fields weaker than 200 $\mathrm{\mu}\text{T}$. Such a gradient can facilitate electron spin mapping with 1 nm resolution using single NV sensors, allowing for nanoscale imaging of electrons. The ability to switch the current on and off and to position the device with high precision overcomes limitations such as limited emitter contrast and the flexibility in sample preparation. Moreover, we show that proximity of the metallic tip to the sensor modifies the Rabi power in a spatially dependent manner, providing regions with enhanced ($\times$3.5) and decreased Rabi power. This spatial gradient, induced by the tip, offers the opportunity for selective pulses on nearby spin species where the same microwave power will result in different spin manipulation characteristics.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent studies on topologically nontrivial moiré bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering untwisted bilayer systems with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data was then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then could model a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.</p>

Although NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at a Néel temperature of $T_{\rm N} = 570$ mK in zero field, ADR experiments achieved a minimum temperature of 220 mK starting from $T = 2$ K under an applied magnetic field of $\mu_0H = 5$ T. The warm-up time back to $T = 2$ K exceeds 60 hours, which is roughly 50 times longer than that of its Yb-based analogue, underscoring the potential of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ as an efficient precooling stage in double-stage ADR systems. We show that NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ can be seen as a network of ferromagnetic spin chains with antiferromagnetic interchain couplings and also investigate the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on the magnetic entropy. We find that the temperature dependence of the entropy plays a more dominant role than its magnetic field dependence in the magnetically ordered state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wout Merbis, Madelon Geurts, Clélia de Mulatier, Philippe Corboz</p>
            <p>The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.</p>

            <p>We perform transport measurements on proximitized, ballistic, bilayer graphene Josephson junctions (BGJJs) in the intermediate-to-long junction regime ($L>\xi$). We measure the device's differential resistance as a function of bias current and gate voltage for a range of different temperatures. The extracted critical current $I_{C}$ follows an exponential trend with temperature: $ \exp(-k_{B} T/ \delta E)$. Here $\delta E = \hbar \nu_F /2\pi L $: an expected trend for intermediate-to-long junctions. From $\delta E$, we determine the Fermi velocity of the bilayer graphene, which is found to increase with gate voltage. Simultaneously, we show the carrier density dependence of $\delta E$, which is attributed to the quadratic dispersion of bilayer graphene. This is in contrast to single layer graphene Josephson junctions, where $\delta E$ and the Fermi velocity are independent of the carrier density. The carrier density dependence in BGJJs allows for additional tuning parameters in graphene-based Josephson Junction devices.</p>

In these theories, the flat bands display a sizable increase of the bandwidth, suggesting a renormalization of the magic angle. Additionally, the corresponding wavefunctions flow towards the limit of perfect particle-hole symmetry and sublattice polarization (the 'chiral' limit). We further represent the flat bands in the 'vortex Chern' basis and discuss the implications on the dynamics regarding the 'flat' and 'chiral' symmetries of MATBG, as manifested in the symmetry-broken states at neutrality.</p>

            <p>A new theoretical framework for the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) scheme is presented to account for the discrete nature of impurities doped in semiconductor nanostructures. The short-range part of impurity potential is included as scattering potential in the self-energy due to spatially localized impurity scattering, and the long-range part of impurity potential is treated as the self-consistent Hartree potential by coupling with the Poisson equation. The position-dependent impurity scattering rate under inhomogeneous impurity profiles is systematically derived so that its physical meaning is clarified. The position dependence of the scattering rate turns out to be represented by the `center of mass' coordinates in the Wigner coordinates, rather than the real-space coordinates. Consequently, impurity scattering is intrinsically nonlocal in space. The proposed framework is applied to cylindrical thin wires under the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) approximation. We show explicitly how the discrete nature of impurities affects the transport properties such as electrostatic potential, local density of states, carrier density, scattering rates, and mobility.</p>

            <p>Wide band gap oxides are promising host materials for spin defect qubits, offering unique advantages such as a dilute nuclear spin environment. Zinc oxide (ZnO), in particular, can achieve exceptional high purity, which enables long spin coherence time. In this work, we theoretically search for deep-level point defects in ZnO with optimal physical properties for optically-addressable spin qubits. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the Molybdenum-vacancy complex defect $Mo_{Zn}v_O$ in ZnO to own promising spin and optical properties, including spin-triplet ground state, optical transition in the visible to near-infrared range with high quantum yield, allowed intersystem crossings with a sizable optically-detected magnetic resonance contrast, and long spin T$_2$ and T$^*_2$. Notably, we find the Huang-Rhys factor of the defect to be around 5, which is significantly smaller than the typical range of 10-30 for most known defects in ZnO. Furthermore, we compare the spin decoherence driven by the nuclear spin bath and paramagnetic impurity baths. We find that the paramagnetic impurities are very effective in causing spin decoherence even with very low concentrations, implying that they can likely dominate the spin decoherence in ZnO even after isotopic purification. Using the computed excited-state energies and kinetic rates as inputs, we predict the ODMR contrast and propose a new protocol for spin qubit initialization and readout, which could be generalized to other systems with forbidden axial intersystem crossings.</p>

In addition to hydrodynamic interactions, mechanical coupling has recently been recognized to play a key role in flagellar synchronization. To explore this, we design a macroscopic model system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model a biflagellated microorganism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with real microswimmers. We quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics.</p>

            <p>Eigenstates of quantum many-body systems are often used to define phases of matter in and out of equilibrium; however, experimentally accessing highly excited eigenstates is a challenging task, calling for alternative strategies to dynamically probe nonequilibrium phases. In this work, we characterize the dynamical properties of a disordered spin chain, focusing on the spin-glass regime. Using tensor-network simulations, we observe oscillatory behavior of local expectation values and bipartite entanglement entropy. We explain these oscillations deep in the many-body localized spin glass regime via a simple theoretical model. From perturbation theory, we predict the timescales up to which our analytical description is valid and confirm it with numerical simulations. Finally, we study the correlation length dynamics, which, after a long-time plateau, resumes growing in line with renormalization group (RG) expectations. Our work suggests that RG predictions can be quantitatively tested against numerical simulations and experiments, potentially enabling microscopic descriptions of dynamical phases in large systems.</p>

            <h2>Particle Geometry Space: An integrated characterization of particle shape, surface area, volume, specific surface, and size distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priya Tripathi, Seung Jae Lee</p>
            <p>Particle size and shape are the key 3D particle geometry parameters that govern the complex behavior of granular materials. The effect of particle size and shape has often been examined in isolation, typically through separate analyses of particle size distribution (PSD) and shape distribution, leading to an unaddressed knowledge gap. Beyond size and shape, 3D particle geometry also includes attributes such as surface area and volume, which together defines the surface-area-to-volume ratio, commonly known as the specific surface. To comprehensively understand the influence of particle geometry on the behavior of granular materials, it is important to integrate these parameters, ideally into a single analytical framework. To this end, this paper presents a new approach, particle geometry space (PGS), formulated based on the principle that the key 3D particle geometry attributes - volume, surface area, and shape - can be uniformly expressed as a function of specific surface. The PGS not only encompasses all 3D particle geometry attributes but also extends its scope by integrating the conventional PSD concept. This innovation enables engineers and researchers who are already familiar with PSD to perform a more systematic characterization of 3D particle geometries. The paper (i) discusses the limitations of existing methods for characterizing 3D particle geometry, (ii) offers an overview of the PGS, (iii) proposes a method for integrating PSD into the PGS, and (iv) demonstrates its application with a set of 3D mineral particle geometry data.</p>

            <h2>Z-basis measurements using mixed parity and direct readout</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pieter Thijs Eendebak, Önder Gül</p>
            <p>Many architectures for quantum information processing rely on qubits dedicated for the readout of a larger quantum register. These ancilla readout qubits present a physical overhead not contributing to the computational resource. A common implementation in spin qubit architectures is the readout schemes based on Pauli exclusion of charges confined in a double quantum dot, with one dot serving as the ancilla qubit. Here, using a three-qubit spin register and a Pauli exclusion-based readout, we present z-basis measurements of the entire register constructed with tomography, eliminating the physical overhead. We validate our approach with simulations which provide insight into potential sources of errors in the reconstruction. We also demonstrate our reconstruction by performing quantum state tomography on a GHZ state of a spin-qubit based device.</p>

            <p>The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhixuan Wen, Tian Yu, Fan Feng</p>
            <p>Recently there have been extensive theoretical, numerical and experimental works on curved-fold origami. However, we notice that a unified and complete geometric framework for describing the geometry and mechanics of curved-fold origami, especially those with nontrivial Gaussian curvature at the crease (non-Euclidean crease), is still absent. Herein we provide a unified geometric framework that describes the shape of a generic curved-fold origami composed of two general strips. The explicit description indicates that four configurations emerge, determined by its spatial crease and configuration branch. Within this geometric framework, we derive the equilibrium equations and study the mechanical response of the curved-crease origami, focusing on Euler's buckling behavior. Both linear stability analysis and finite element simulation indicate that the overlaid configuration exhibits a lower buckling threshold. To further capture the large deformation behavior efficiently, we develop a bistrip model based on the anisotropic Kirchhoff rod theory, which predicts the main features successfully. This work bridges the geometry and mechanics of curved-crease origami, offering insights for applications in robotics, actuators, and deployable space structures.</p>

            <p>In the context of a growing interdisciplinary interest in the angular momentum of wave fields, the spin-wave case has yet to be fully explored, with the extensively studied notion of spin transport being only part of the broader picture. Here we report experimental evidence for magnon orbital angular momentum, demonstrating that the mode exhibits rotation rather than remaining stationary. This conclusion is drawn from observations of the lifted degeneracy of waves with counter-rotating wave fronts. This requires an unambiguous formulation of spin and orbital angular momenta for spin waves, which we provide in full generality based on a systematic application of quantum field theory techniques. The results unequivocally establish magnetic dipole-dipole interactions as a magnetic-field controllable spin-orbit interaction for magnons. Our findings open a new research direction, leveraging the spectroscopic readability of angular momentum for azimuthal spin waves and other related systems.</p>

            <p>In the context of an ever-expanding experimental and theoretical interest in the magnetization dynamics of mesoscopic magnetic structures, both in the classical and quantum regimes, we formulate a low energy field theory for the linear spin-waves in finite and textured ferromagnets and we perform its constrained canonical quantization. The introduction of a manifestly gauge invariant Lagrangian enables a straightforward application of the Noether's theorem. Taking advantage of this in the context of a broad class of axisymmetric ferromagnets of special conceptual and experimental relevance, a general expression of the conserved and quantized spin-wave total angular momentum is rigorously derived, while separate conservation and quantization of its orbital and spin components are established for a more restricted class of uniaxial exchange ferromagnets. Further particularizing this general framework to the case of axially saturated magnetic thin disks, we develop a semi-analytic theory of the low frequency part of the exchange-dipole azimuthal spin wave spectrum, providing a powerful theoretical platform for the analysis and interpretation of magnetic resonance experiments on magnetic microdots as further demonstrated in a joint paper [arxiv The Orbital Angular Momentum of Azimuthal Spin-Waves]</p>

            <p>Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</p>

            <p>Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal fundamental trade-offs between precision and thermodynamic quantities, yet their empirical verification remains limited. We present an approach using quantum computers to verify a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Our method, which implements quantum dynamics on physical qubits, enables us to investigate the measurability of relevant quantities, the relation's validity under physical noise, and its empirical tightness. Specifically, quantum computers' versatility allows for the examination of arbitrary observables. We address current quantum processor limitations through a three-fold strategy: generalizing the relation to generic observables under arbitrary quantum channels, proposing a method to measure the target thermodynamic quantity (survival activity) in the weak coupling regime, and reducing circuit depth by leveraging relation properties. Demonstrations on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor validate our relation in open qubit systems and achieve saturation with an optimal observable requiring entangled measurements. The relation is further verified in a quantum time correlator measurement protocol, confirming the broad applicability of our method. This study highlights the potential of noisy quantum computers for demonstrating quantum thermodynamic trade-offs.</p>

            <p>Recently, Patel et al. introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in a Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar field with a vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector and scalar interactions, although the details are largely different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimensions and not in higher dimensions, regardless of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the rôle of spatial random disorder and find a simple explanation of how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to a strange metal by changing the self-energies of the involved bosons and fermions.</p>

            <p>Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation of many-body physics. However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</p>

We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</p>

            <p>The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers. These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian, enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution. Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of $n=4$ and $n=8$ spins. Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum computers.</p>

            <h2>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</p>

            <p>We develop a random sampling method for calculating the time evolution of the Rényi entanglement entropy after a quantum quench from an insulating state in free boson systems. Because of the non-Gaussian nature of the initial state, calculating the Rényi entanglement entropy calls for the exponential cost of computing a matrix permanent. We numerically demonstrate that a simple random sampling method reduces the computational cost of a permanent; for an $N_{\mathrm{s}}\times N_{\mathrm{s}}$ matrix corresponding to $N_{\mathrm{s}}$ sites at half filling, the sampling cost becomes $\mathcal{O}(2^{\alpha N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ with a constant $\alpha\ll 1$, in contrast to the conventional algorithm with the $\mathcal{O}(2^{N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ number of summations requiring the exponential time cost. Although the computational cost is still exponential, this improvement allows us to obtain the entanglement entropy dynamics in free boson systems for more than $100$ sites. We present several examples of the entanglement entropy dynamics in low-dimensional free boson systems.</p>

These devices have their probe frequencies in the range 150 MHz--200 MHz, which is well detuned from the heater frequencies of 4.4 GHz--7.6 GHz compatible with typical readout frequencies of superconducting qubits. Importantly, we show on-demand triggering of both individual and multiple low-noise SNS bolometers with very low cross talk.

            <p>Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</p>

This approach, which is geared towards future integration into industrial environments, yields state-of-the-art entangled photon pair creation performance while retaining flexibility and adjustability required for long-term operation of such a device - all while dramatically reducing the overall system footprint. We demonstrate near diffraction-limited performance and hyperspectral imaging utilizing a 3D-printed micro-objective with a full width at half maximum resolution limit of 604(16) nm when operating the system at a cryogenic temperature of 3.8 K. Furthermore, we prove that this system can be used to achieve single photon emission rates of 392(20) kHz at a 76 MHz pump rate and purities of 99.2(5) % using two-photon resonant excitation.

Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonio M. García-García, Zhongling Lu, Lucas Sá, Jacobus J. M. Verbaarschot</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</p>

            <p>We present a theory of spin-polarized superconductivity from the condensation of excitonic Cooper pairs, which are charge-$2e$ bosonic quasiparticles made of Cooper pairs strongly hybridized with excitons. By solving a model of spin-polarized electrons using the strong-coupling expansion to the second order, we demonstrate the emergence of excitonic Cooper pairs from electron-hole fluctuations upon doping a strongly correlated insulator. We characterize their binding energy, effective mass, and the resulting superconducting transition temperature. We propose possible realization of spin-polarized superconductivity in twisted semiconductors with honeycomb moiré superlattice.</p>

            <h2>Electric polarization in Chern insulators: Unifying many-body and single-particle approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Zhang, Maissam Barkeshli</p>
            <p>Recently, it has been established that Chern insulators possess an intrinsic two-dimensional electric polarization, despite having gapless edge states and non-localizable Wannier orbitals. This polarization, $\vec{P}_{\text{o}}$, can be defined in a many-body setting from various physical quantities, including dislocation charges, boundary charge distributions, and linear momentum. Importantly, there is a dependence on a choice of real-space origin $\text{o}$ within the unit cell. In contrast, Coh and Vanderbilt extended the single-particle Berry phase definition of polarization to Chern insulators by choosing an arbitrary point in momentum space, $\vec{k}_0$. In this paper, we unify these two approaches and show that when the real-space origin $\text{o}$ and momentum-space point $\vec{k}_0$ are appropriately chosen in relation to each other, the Berry phase and many-body definitions of polarization are equal.</p>

            <p>The evolution of the role of lattice vibrations in the formation of the pseudogap state in strongly correlated electron systems has been investigated concerning changes in the electron-phonon coupling parameters and the concentration of doped charge carriers. We apply the polaronic version of the generalized tight-binding method to analyze the band structure of a realistic multiband two-dimensional model that incorporates the electron-lattice contributions of both Holstein and Peierls types. It has been demonstrated that the emergence of polaronic effects begins with the modulation of spectral function intensity. However, within a specific region of the phase diagram, a significant transformation of the electron band structure and pseudogap state occurs. It results from coherent polaron excitations that create a partially flat band near the Fermi level. This process leads to a change in the topology of the Fermi surface and the emergence of corresponding features in the density of states.</p>

            <h2>Controllable and Continuous Quantum Phase Transitions in Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator</h2>

            <p>The intrinsic magnetic topological material MnBi2Te4 has demonstrated great potential to investigate the interplay between topology and magnetism, which opens up new avenues for manipulating non-trivial electronic states and designing quantum devices. However, challenges and controversies remain due to its inevitable n-type antisite defects, hindering the experimental realization of intrinsic magnetic topological phenomena and rendering the precise control of topological phase transitions (TPTs) unachievable. Here, we study a candidate material family, Mn(1-x)GexBi2Te4, in which the heavy n-type doping features are strongly suppressed when the Ge content reaches 0.46, and multiple topological phases are well maintained with the surface Dirac point located near the Fermi level. Based on angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we reveal two magnetism-induced TPTs: the first is antiferromagnetic-ordering-induced transition from strong topological insulator to a magnetic topological insulator as revealed by gap opening of topological surface states; the second is external-magnetic-field-dependent transition from magnetic topological insulator to a Weyl semimetal with the gap reclosed. Our work paves the way for the realization of intrinsic magnetic topological states in MnBi2Te4 family and provides an ideal platform for achieving controllable and continuous TPTs towards future spintronic applications.</p>

We explore the effect of stochastic resetting on the dynamics of a two-level and a three-level quantum heat engine. The extracted work is shown to increase with the resetting rate. However, the effective efficiency that includes the work expended in resetting is shown to exhibit a steady decay with the increase in resetting rate. The efficient power is observed to increase beyond that obtained in the absence of resetting, and is shown to be higher for a three-level engine.</p>

            <p>Controlling the flow of heat in quantum systems or circuits is very desirable for the development of quantum technologies. Here, we investigate the quantum heat transport in a driven hybrid magnonphoton system in contact with two thermal baths operating at different temperatures. Specifically, we analyze the role of the parameters of the hybrid quantum system in the processes that lead to the asymmetry of the steady-state heat current. We find that the thermal rectification is high in the regime of weak magnon-photon hybridization strength and large magnon-drive. Moreover, this driving and the system parameters could serve as experimental knobs to tune the thermodynamic properties of the magnon-photon system, as we demonstrate for the rectification parameter tunable by the drive in its entire physical range. The results from this research would provide very useful insight into the design of quantum thermal machines with a driven magnon-photon system.</p>

            <h2>Skyrmion Molecule Lattices Enabling Stable Transport and Flexible Manipulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Liu, Xiujuan Zhang, Ming-Hui Lu, Yan-Feng Chen</p>
            <p>Skyrmions--topologically protected nanoscale spin textures with vortex-like configurations--hold transformative potential for ultra-dense data storage, spintronics and quantum computing. However, their practical utility is challenged by dynamic instability, complex interaction, and the lack of deterministic control. While recent efforts using classical wave systems have enabled skyrmion simulations via engineered excitations, these realizations rely on fragile interference patterns, precluding stable transport and flexible control. Here, we introduce a skyrmion molecule lattice, a novel architecture where pairs of spin skyrmions with opposite polarizability are symmetry-locked into stable molecule configurations. These molecules emerge as propagating eigenstates of the system, overcoming the static limitations of previous realizations. We further develop a boundary engineering technique, achieving precise control over skyrmion creation, deformation, annihilation, and polarizability inversion. As a proof of concept, we design a graphene-like acoustic surface wave metamaterial, where meta-atom pairs generate vortices with opposite orbital angular momenta, which couple to acoustic spin textures, forming skyrmion molecules. Experimental measurements confirm their stable transport and flexible control. Our work leverages the symmetry-locked molecule lattice to preserve the topological quasiparticle nature of skyrmions, offering a universal framework for their stabilization, transportation and manipulation. This bridges critical gaps in skyrmion physics, with potential impacts on wave-based sensing, information processing, and topological waveguiding.</p>

            <h2>Topological superconductivity in two-dimensional $π$-junction Dirac semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yijie Mo, Xiao-Jiao Wang, Zhongbo Yan</p>
            <p>Odd-parity pairings offer a natural pathway for realizing topological superconductivity. When two identical even-parity superconductors form a $\pi$-junction, the metallic material sandwiched between them experiences an effective odd-parity pairing, facilitating the emergence of topological superconductivity in the intermediate region. In this work, we consider the intermediate material to be a two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Dirac semimetal. When the two superconductors are conventional s-wave superconductors, we find that a helical topological superconductor can be realized. This phase is characterized by the presence of a pair of helical Majorana edge states. Interestingly, when the superconductors are $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductors, we observe not only the helical topological superconductor but also an unconventional topological superconductor. The latter is distinguished by the existence of two pairs of helical Majorana edge states, despite the fact that the global topological invariants for this system take on trivial values. By further applying an in-plane magnetic field, we demonstrate that second-order topological superconducting phases can be achieved. These phases host isolated Majorana corner modes as well as twofold Majorana corner modes. Our findings reveal that two-dimensional $\pi$-junction Dirac semimetals can support a rich variety of topological superconducting phases, offering a versatile platform for exploring exotic topological phenomena.</p>

            <p>We study two-dimensional superconductivity mediated by magnetic fluctuations at the interface between a ferromagnetic insulator and the nonsymmorphic topological crystalline insulator with a fourfold-degenerate Dirac point, wallpaper fermion. We demonstrate that BCS pairing with zero center-of-mass momentum induces chiral $p$-wave superconductivity, and the Amperean pairing with center-of-mass momentum $2k_{\rm F}$ can give rise to a parity-mixed superconducting state. We find that the Amperean pairing exhibits a mixture of $s$-wave and $p$-wave components due to the multiband nature of the wallpaper fermion and the easy-axis anisotropy of the ferromagnetic insulator. Additionally, we find that the stability of the superconducting state with BCS and the Amperean pairing is governed by the easy-axis anisotropy.</p>

            <p>The realization of various qubit systems based on high-quality hybrid superconducting quantum devices, is often achieved using semiconductor nanowires. For such hybrid devices, a good coupling between the superconductor and the conducting states in the semiconductor wire is crucial. GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires with an insulating core, and a conductive InAs shell fulfill this requirement, since the electronic states are strongly confined near the surface. However, maintaining a good crystal quality in the conducting shell is a challenge for this type of nanowire. In this work, we present phase-pure zincblende GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires and analyze their low-temperature magnetotransport properties. We observe pronounced magnetic flux quantum periodic oscillations, which can be attributed to a combination of Aharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations. From the gate and temperature dependence of the conductance oscillations, as well as from supporting theoretical transport calculations, we conclude that the conducting states in the shell are in the quasi-ballistic transport regime, with few scattering centers, but nevertheless leading to an Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak correction that dominates at small magnetic field strengths. Our results demonstrate that phase-pure zincblende GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires represent a very promising alternative semiconductor nanowire-based platform for hybrid quantum devices.</p>

            <p>The thermal response of proximity Josephson junctions (JJs) is governed by the temperature ($T$)-dependent occupation of Andreev bound states (ABS), making them promising candidates for sensitive thermal detection. In this study, we systematically engineer ABS to enhance the thermal sensitivity of the critical current ($I_c$) of proximity JJs, quantified as $|\,dI_c/dT\,|$ for the threshold readout scheme and $|\,dI_c/dT \cdot I_c^{-1}\,|$ for the inductive readout scheme. Using a gate-tunable graphene-based JJ platform, we explore the impact of key parameters -- including channel length, transparency, carrier density, and superconducting material -- on the thermal response. Our results reveal that the proximity-induced superconducting gap plays a crucial role in optimizing thermal sensitivity. Notably, we see a maximum $|\,dI_c/dT \cdot I_c^{-1}\,|$ value of $0.6\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ at low temperatures with titanium-based graphene JJs. By demonstrating a systematic approach to engineering ABS in proximity JJs, this work establishes a versatile framework for optimizing thermal sensors and advancing the study of ABS-mediated transport.</p>

            <h2>Exceptional Topology of Non-Hermitian Brillouin Klein Bottles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> W. B. Rui, Z. D. Wang</p>
            <p>Exceptional points (EPs) are prominent non-Hermitian band degeneracies that give rise to a variety of intriguing and unconventional phenomena. Similar to Weyl and Dirac points, EPs carry topological charges and comply with the celebrated fermion doubling theorems in lattices. Beyond these characteristics, EPs exhibit more exotic topological properties, particularly non-Abelian braiding topologies not seen in conventional degeneracies. Here, we investigate these foundational concepts of EPs in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices where the fundamental domain of the Brillouin zone is a Klein bottle, rather than a torus assumed in previous studies. We find that EPs do not necessarily appear in pairs with opposite topological charges in the Brillouin Klein bottle, thus violating the fermion doubling theorem. The violation occurs because, without crossing the boundary, the sum of the topological charges of EPs is in fact an even number rather than zero. Moreover, we uncover unique braiding topologies of EPs that cannot be captured by existing theories. Specifically, the composite braidings around all EPs equals the braiding along the boundary of the Brillouin Klein bottle. This novel braiding topology further confirms the failure of the fermion doubling theorem, and allows us to explore the non-Abelian braidings of EPs beyond the scope of topological charges. Our work highlights the fundamental role of Brillouin-zone topology in non-Hermitian systems.</p>

            <h2>Origin of switchable quasiparticle-interference chirality in loop-current phase of kagome metals measured by scanning-tunneling-microscopy</h2>

            <p>The chiral loop-current (LC) phase in kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K) has attracted considerable attention as a novel quantum state driven by electron correlations. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments have provided strong evidence for the chiral LC phase through the detection of chirality in the quasiparticle interference (QPI) signal. However, the fundamental relationship between ``QPI chirality'' and ``LC chirality'' remains unexplored. For instance, the QPI signal is unchanged even when all LC orders are inverted. Furthermore, only the chiral LC order cannot induce QPI chirality. At present, the true essence of kagome metals that we should learn from the remarkable QPI experiments remains elusive. To address this, we investigate the origin of the QPI signal in the LC phase using a large unit-cell tight-binding model for kagome metals. The LC phase gives rise to a $Z_3$ nematic phase, characterized by three distinct directors, under the Star-of-David bond order. Our findings demonstrate that the QPI chirality induced by a single impurity at site Z, denoted as $\chi_Z$, can take values of $\pm1$ (chiral) or 0 (achiral), depending on the direction of the $Z_3$ nematic order. Prominent QPI chirality originates from extremely dilute impurities ($\lesssim$0.1%) in the present mechanism. Notably, $\chi_Z$ ($=\pm1$, 0) changes smoothly with minimal free-energy barriers by applying a small magnetic field $B_z$, accompanied by a switching of the $Z_3$ nematic director. This study provides a comprehensive explanation for the observed ``$B_z$-switchable QPI chirality'' in regions with dilute impurities, offering fundamental insight into the chiral LC in kagome metals.</p>

            <p>Amorphous multi-element materials offer unprecedented tunability in composition and properties, yet their rational design remains challenging due to the lack of predictive structure-property relationships and the vast configurational space. Traditional modeling struggles to capture the intricate short-range order that dictates their stability and functionality. We here introduce ApolloX, a pioneering predictive framework for amorphous multi-element materials, establishing a new paradigm by integrating physics-informed generative modeling with particle swarm optimization, using chemical short-range order as an explicit constraint. By systematically navigating the disordered energy landscape, ApolloX enables the targeted design of thermodynamically stable amorphous configurations. It accurately predicts atomic-scale arrangements, including composition-driven metal clustering and amorphization trends, which are well-validated by experiments, while also guiding synthesis by leveraging sluggish diffusion to control elemental distribution and disorder. The resulting structural evolution, governed by composition, directly impacts catalytic performance, leading to improved activity and stability with increasing amorphization. This predictive-experimental synergy transforms the discovery of amorphous materials, unlocking new frontiers in catalysis, energy storage, and functional disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Arabinoxylans are constituents of wheat flour that contribute to the dietary fiber properties of wheat. They exist in water-extractable and water-unextractable forms and contribute to human health. In bakery technology, especially the water-extractable arabinoxylans (WE-AX) are important due to their impact on viscosity and dough rheology. This study provides insights into the impact of wheat flour fermentation on WE-AX during sourdough production, offering potential applications for improving sourdough bread quality and its health benefits. The production of sourdoughs is known to increase the WE-AX fraction, yet the underlying (bio)chemical mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the alteration of WE-AX during the fermentation of wheat flour for sourdough production using 1H Diffusion Ordered SpectroscopY (DOSY) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) at elevated temperature to analyze the structural changes of WE-AX during wheat flour fermentation for sourdough production with different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains. The results confirmed that DOSY NMR at elevated temperatures greatly improved the applicability of the method for analyzing larger biomolecules. Overall, a size reduction of the WE-AX compounds with increasing fermentation time was found. This was indicated both by the occurrence of higher self-diffusion coefficients, and increased transverse relaxation times. Further research is necessary to explain deviations from the general trend.</p>

            <p>Fermi arcs are one of the characteristic features of Weyl semimetals, appearing as surface states that connect Weyl points with opposite chiralities. It has also been suggested that Fermi arcs can emerge in the bulk due to the interplay between magnetic textures and Weyl physics.

We systematically analyze domain wall-induced Fermi arcs in Ti$_2$MnAl using an effective tight-binding model. By varying the strength of spin-orbit coupling, we confirmed that these domain wall-induced Fermi arcs emerge as a result of shifts in the positions of the Weyl points. Furthermore, we found that these domain wall-induced Fermi arcs in Ti$_2$MnAl originate from the Chern number and represent a topologically robust state that is independent of the domain wall width.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Banik Rai, Nitesh Kumar</p>
            <p>Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a cusp-like feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away from the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This feature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a non-coplanar spin structure. In this Letter, we have studied the uniaxial ferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a consequence of the non-orthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is expected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy axis of magnetization, non-orthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity, exhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the magnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation of the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on the evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a non-orthogonal external magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Due to their unique dimensionality, the physical properties of two-dimensional materials are deeply impacted by their surroundings, calling for a thorough understanding and control of these effects. We investigated the influence of the substrate and the pressure transmitting medium on bilayer graphene in a unique high-pressure environment where the sample is partially suspended and partially supported. By employing Raman spectroscopy with a sub-micron spatial resolution, we explored the evolution of strain and doping, and demonstrated that they are both similarly induced in the suspended and supported regions of the bilayer graphene within the studied pressure range. Almost full strain and doping transfer between the supported and suspended regions is concluded. We observed that charge carrier density saturates quickly at low pressures (2 GPa) while biaxial strain continuously increases with pressure. Additionally, Raman spatial mapping highlights a rather uniform doping and strain distribution, yet with significant local variations revealing a more complex scenario than previously documented by single-point studies at high pressure.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic nuclear analogs with active wave-particle clusters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahil N. Valani, David M. Paganin</p>
            <p>Active particles are non-equilibrium entities that uptake energy and convert it into self-propulsion. A dynamically rich class of active particles having features of wave-particle coupling and memory are walking/superwalking droplets. Such classical, active wave-particle entities (WPEs) have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of many single-particle quantum systems. We numerically investigate the dynamics of several WPEs and find that they self-organize into a bound cluster, akin to a nucleus. This active cluster exhibits various modes of collective excitations as the memory of the system is increased. Dynamically distinct excitation modes create a common time-averaged collective potential indicating an analogy with the bag model of a nucleus. At high memory, the active cluster can destabilize and eject WPEs whose decay statistics follow exponential laws analogous to radioactive nuclear decay. Hydrodynamic nuclear analogs open up new directions to pursue, both experimentally and numerically, within the nascent field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs.</p>

            <h2>Helical edge states and enhanced superconducting gaps in Bi islands on FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuanhao Wen, Zhiyong Hou, Zhiyuan Shang, Huan Yang, Hai-Hu Wen</p>
            <p>By measuring scanning tunneling spectroscopy on some large Bi islands deposited on FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ superconductors, we observe clear evidence of topological in-gap edge states with double peaks at about $\pm 1.0$ meV on the spectra measured near the perimeter of the islands. The edge states spread towards the inner side of the islands over a width of 2-3 nm. The two edge-state peaks at positive and negative energies both move to higher values with increase of the magnetic field, and they disappear near the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ of FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$. The edge states are interpreted as the counter-propagating topological edge states induced by the strong spin-orbit coupling effect of the Bi island, and the zero-energy mode emerges when the edge states touch each other in some small Bi islands. Meanwhile, enhanced superconducting gaps are observed in the central regions of these Bi islands, which may be induced by the enhanced pair potential of the topological surface state. Our observations provide useful message for the nontrivial topological superconductivity on specific Bi islands grown on FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ substrate.</p>

            <p>The growth of cracks combines materials science, fracture mechanics, and statistical physics. The importance of fluctuations in the crack velocity is fundamental since it signals that the crack overcomes local barriers such as tough spots by avalanches. In ductile materials the omnipresent plasticity close to the crack tip influences the growth by history effects, which we here study in polymethylmetacrylate by various fatigue and creep protocols. We show how the crack tip local history may be encompassed in a time- and protocol dependent lengthscale, that allows to apply a statistical fracture description to the time-dependent crack growth rate, resolving the well-known paradox why fatigue cracks grow faster if the stress during a cycle is let to relax more from the peak value. The results open up novel directions for understanding fracture by statistical physics.</p>

            <h2>Hydrogen Bond Strength Dictates the Rate-Limiting Steps of Diffusion in Proton-Conducting Perovskites:A Critical Length Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Ma, Ying Liang, Tianxing Ma, Jiajun Linghu, Zhi-Peng Li</p>
            <p>Proton-conducting solid oxide fuel cells (PC-SOFCs) are pivotal for their high proton conductivity and superior performance. The proton conduction mechanism is commonly described by the Grotthuss mechanism, involving proton rotation and transfer. While proton transfer is often considered the rate-limiting step, the underlying reasons remain unclear. Through density functional theory calculations on undoped, A-site doped, and B-site doped BaHfO$_3$ systems, we demonstrate that the rate-limiting nature of proton transfer stems from the formation of weaker hydrogen bonds. In systems with strong hydrogen bonds, proton rotation becomes non-negligible. We identify a critical hydrogen bond length that distinguishes strong from weak bonds, with shorter lengths correlating with distorted perovskite structures and configurations deviating from cubic. This insight into the necessity of rotation is crucial for screening and optimizing materials with superior proton conduction properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aslak Fellman, Jesper Byggmästar, Fredric Granberg, Flyura Djurabekova, Kai Nordlund</p>
            <p>We develop a machine-learned interatomic potential for AlCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys (HEA) using a diverse set of structures from density functional theory calculated including magnetic effects. The potential is based on the computationally efficient tabulated version of the Gaussian approximation potential method (tabGAP) and is a general-purpose model for molecular dynamics simulation of the HEA system, with additional emphasis on radiation damage effects. We use the potential to study key properties of AlCrCuFeNi HEAs at different compositions, focusing on the FCC/BCC phase stability. Monte Carlo swapping simulations are performed to understand the stability and segregation of the HEA and reveal clear FeCr and Cu segregation. Close to equiatomic composition, a transition from FCC to BCC is detected, following the valence electron concentration stability rule. Furthermore, we perform overlapping cascade simulations to investigate radiation damage production and tolerance. Different alloy compositions show significant differences in defect concentrations, and all alloy compositions show enrichment of some elements in or around defects. We find that, generally, a lower Al content corresponds to lower defect concentrations during irradiation. Furthermore, clear short-range ordering is observed as a consequence of continued irradiation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusuke Hashimoto, Xue Jia, Li Hao, Takaaki Toma</p>
            <p>Materials informatics (MI), which emerges from the integration of materials science and data science, is expected to greatly streamline the material discovery and development. The data used for MI are obtained from both computational and experimental studies, while their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we reported the integration of these datasets by applying a machine learning model that captures trends hidden in the experimental datasets to compositional data stored in the computational database. In this study, we use the obtained data to construct materials maps, which visualize the relation in the structural features of materials, aiming to support study by the experimental researchers. The map is constructed using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which implements the graph-based representation of material structures, deep learning, and dimensional reduction for the map construction. We evaluate the obtained materials maps through statistical analysis and found that the MDL using message passing neural network (MPNN) enables efficient extraction of features that reflect the structural complexity of materials. Moreover, we found that this advantage does not necessarily translate into improved accuracy in predicting material properties. We attribute this unexpected outcome to the high learning performance inherent in MPNN, which can contribute to the structuring of data points within the materials map.</p>

            <p>Bioelectrochemistry is crucial for understanding biological functions and driving applications in synthetic biology, healthcare, and catalysis. However, current simulation methods fail to capture both the stochastic nature of molecular motion and electron transfer across the relevant picosecond-to-minute timescales. We present QBIOL, a web-accessible software that integrates molecular dynamics, applied mathematics, GPU programming, and quantum charge transport to address this challenge. QBIOL enables quantitative stochastic electron transfer simulations and has the potential to reproduce numerically any (bio) electrochemical experiments. We illustrate this potential by comparing our simulations with experimental data on the current generated by electrode-attached redox-labeled DNA, or by nanoconfined redox species, in response to a variety of electrical excitation waveforms, configurations of interest in biosensing and catalysis. The adaptable architecture of QBIOL extends to the development of devices for quantum and molecular technologies, positioning our software as a powerful tool for enabling new research in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <h2>Floquet-engineered diode performance in a Majorana-quantum dot Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustav Roy, Gourab Paul, Debika Debnath, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>We study nonreciprocal signatures of Josephson current (JC) in a quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction (JJ) that comprises of two periodically driven Kitaev chains (KCs) coupled with an intervening QD. The simultaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{IS}$) and the time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{TRS}$), indispensable for the Josephson diode effect (JDE), is achieved solely via the two Floquet drives that differ by a finite phase, which eventually results in a nonreciprocal current, and hence yields a finite JDE. It may be noted that the Floquet Majorana modes generated at both the far ends of the KCs (away from the QD) and adjacent to the QD junctions mediate the JC owing to a finite superconducting (SC) phase difference in the two KCs. We calculate the time-averaged JC and inspect the tunability of the current-phase relation (CPR) to ascertain the diode characteristics. The asymmetric Floquet drive also manifests an anomalous JC signature in our KC-QD-KC JJ. Furthermore, additional control over the QD energy level can be achieved via an external gate voltage that renders flexibility for the Josephson diode (JD) to act as an SC switching device. Tuning different system parameters, such as the chemical potential of the KCs, Floquet frequency, the relative phase mismatch of the drives, and the gate voltage, our model shows the highest possible rectification to be around $70\%$. Summarizing, our study provides an alternative scenario, replacing the traditional usage of an external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling effects in a JD via asymmetrically driven Kitaev leads that entail Majorana-mediated transport.</p>

            <h2>Coherent Phonon Pairs and Rotational Symmetry Breaking of Charge Density Wave Order in the Kagome Metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qinwen Deng, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Binghai Yan, Liang Wu</p>
            <p>In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to study the symmetry breaking in the charge-density wave (CDW) phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we discover close phonon pairs near 1.3 THz and 3.1 THz, as well as a new mode at 1.84 THz. The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are observed up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional theory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence of Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold rotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient reflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order. Our results thus indicate broken six-fold rotational symmetry in the charge-density wave state of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, along with the absence of nematic fluctuation above T$_{\text{CDW}}$. Meanwhile, the measured coherent phonon spectrum in the CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-\text{x}}$Sn$_\text{x}$ with x = 0.03-0.04 matches with staggered inverse Star-of-David with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift. This CDW structure contrasts with undoped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and explains the evolution from phonon pair to a single mode at 1.3 THz by x = 0.03-0.04 Sn-doping.</p>

            <p>Optoionics, a promising new field that aims at controlling ion dynamics using light, links photovoltaic power generation with electrochemical charge storage. This has the potential to drive and accelerate the energy revolution by utilizing materials that integrate the functionality of batteriesand photovoltaic cells.

Computational modeling can play a crucial role in guiding and speeding up these processes, particularly when the atomic mechanisms are not well understood. This does however require expertise in various areas, including advanced electronic-structure theory, machine learning, and multi-scale approaches. In this perspective, we shed light on the intricacies of modeling optoionic effects for solar battery materials. We first discuss the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms, as well as the computational tools that are available to date for describing these processes. Furthermore, we discuss the limits of these approaches and identify key challenges that need to be tackled to advance this field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rene Alvarez-Donado, Matias Sepulveda-Macias, Anne Tanguy</p>
            <p>We employed molecular dynamics simulations to explore comparatively the thermo-mechanical behavior of two glass materials-an oxide silica glass (SiO2) and a binary Cu-Zr-based metallic alloy (Cu50Zr50)-during shear deformation cycles. By calculating the energy balance and tracking the temperature evolution of both glasses under deformation cycles, we are able to propose, for each of them, a constitutive law which accurately reproduces the self-heating process due to plastic deformation. These relatively simple constitutive laws involve strain rate sensitivity and a non-linear temperature dependence of the thermal dilatancy coefficients, as well as strain gradient plasticity. To identify the right parameters, both glasses are equilibrated at very low temperature (10 K) and two independent deformation rates were applied to each sample. Thermal attenuation is greatly amplified in silica compared to the metallic glass. Moreover, using precise atomic description of the instantaneous deformation, combined with exact coarse-graining procedure, we show that selfheating is mainly supported, in silica, by inhomogeneous strain gradient plasticity with nanometric characteristic lengthscales.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) Metal Halides present unique and tunable properties, offering a plethora of applications in optoelectronics. However, the direct and oriented synthesis of these materials is challenging due to the low formation energies that result in fast, uncontrollable growth dynamics during solution-based processing. Here, we report the solvent-free growth of oriented and n = 1 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). In situ photoluminescence (PL) during PLD reveal that the n =1 RP phase of $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ forms at the first stages of growth. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and grazing-incidence wide-angle scattering (GIWAXS) measurements confirm the formation of single oriented n = 1 phase of $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ independent of the underlying substrate. Co-localized spatially resolved PL and AFM further validate the conformal growth of the n = 1 phase. While oriented growth is substrate-independent, the stability of the 2D films is influenced by the substrate. PLD-grown 2D RP films grown onto epitaxial $\mbox{MAPbI}_3$ films are stable over 80 days, showing no sign of cation exchange. This work highlights the potential of PLD for direct, room-temperature synthesis of 2D $(\mbox{PEA})_2\mbox{PbI}_4$ RP films on diverse substrates and demonstrates the feasibility of stable 2D/3D heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Screened spherical wave (SSW) of the Hankel function features the complete, minimal and short-ranged basis set, presenting a compact representation for electronic systems. In this work, we report the implementation of full-potential (FP) SSW based tight-binding linearized Muffin-Tin orbital (TB-LMTO) for all-electron density functional theory (DFT), and provide extensive tests on the robustness of FP-TB-LMTO and its high accuracy for first-principles material simulation. Through the introduction of double augmentation, SSW based MTO is accurately represented on the double grids including the full-space uniform and dense radial grids. Based on the the double augmentation, the accurate computation of full charge density, full potential,complex integral in the interstitial region and the total energy are all effectively addressed to realize the FP-TB-LMTO for DFT self-consistent calculations. By calculating the total energy,band structure, phase ordering, and elastic constants for a wide variety of materials, including normal metals, compounds, and diamond silicon, we domenstrate the highly accurate numerical implemetation of FP-TB-LMTO for all-electron DFT in comparison with other well-established FP method. The implementation of FP-TB-LMTO based DFT offers an important tool for the accurate first-principles tight-binding electronic structure calculations, particular important for the large-scale or strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Topological semimetals, particularly Weyl semimetals (WSMs), are crucial platforms for exploring emergent quantum phenomena due to their unique electronic structures and potential to transition into various topological phases. In this study, we report the discovery of a ferromagnetic (FM) type-II WSM in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)4Te7, which exhibits a remarkable three-dimensional (3D) quantum Hall effect (QHE). By precisely tuning the chemical potential through Sb doping, we obtained samples with the Fermi level near the charge neutrality point for x = ~ 0.27. This was confirmed by spectroscopy measurements (ARPES and STS), and these samples showed strong quantum oscillations along with a key transport signature of a Weyl state - chiral anomaly, and Fermi surface reconstruction driven by FM ordering. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this Weyl state evolves from a parent nodal ring state, where higher-order k-terms split the nodal line into type-II Weyl nodes. The Weyl state exhibits significant anisotropy, characterized by a pronounced reduction in Fermi velocity along the kz-axis, likely accounting for the observed 3D QHE. These results not only highlight the exceptional tunability of the Mn(Bi1-xSbx)4Te7 system, where precise control of the chemical potential and magnetic properties opens access to novel quantum phases, but also advance the understanding of FM WSMs.</p>

            <p>Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce.</p>

This study's goal is to ascertain the result of the road surface's influence on the vehicle, calculate the average vehicle body displacement acceleration and dynamic load coefficient, and validate your findings through testing.

Simulations are carried out using Matlab Simulink software to examine and assess the dynamics. Results: According to ISO 8608:2016 standard [2], theoretical research results have determined the average acceleration of the vehicle body, dynamic load coefficient, horizontal sway angle, and longitudinal sway angle when the vehicle moves on profiles C, D , E, F. Experiments show that there is an error of 7.4% and 8.1% when measuring the average acceleration and dynamic load coefficient kđmax when the vehicle moves at a speed of 50 km/h on the road surface C compared to theory.</p>

            <p>Nucleation in the supercooled Yukawa system is relevant for addressing current challenges in understanding a range of crystallizing systems including white dwarf (WD) stars. We use both brute force and seeded molecular dynamics simulations to study homogeneous nucleation of crystals from supercooled Yukawa liquids. With our improved approach to seeded simulations, we obtain quantitative predictions of the crystal nucleation rate and cluster size distributions as a function of temperature and screening length. These quantitative results show trends towards fast nucleation with short-ranged potentials. They also indicate that for temperatures $T > 0.9T_m$, where $T_m$ is the melt temperature, classical homogeneous nucleation is too slow to initiate crystallization but transient clusters of around 100 particles should be common. We apply these general results to a typical WD model and obtain a delay of approximately 0.6 Gyr in the onset of crystallization that may be observable.</p>

            <p>Interactions between crawling cells, which are essential for many biological processes, can be quantified by measuring cell-cell collisions. Conventionally, experiments of cell-cell collisions are conducted on two-dimensional flat substrates, where colliding cells repolarize and move away upon contact with one another in "contact inhibition of locomotion" (CIL). Inspired by recent experiments that show cells on suspended nanofibers have qualitatively different CIL behaviors than those on flat substrates, we develop a phase field model of cell motility and two-cell collisions in fiber geometries. Our model includes cell-cell and cell-fiber adhesion, and a simple positive feedback mechanism of cell polarity. We focus on cell collisions on two parallel fibers, finding that larger cell deformability (lower membrane tension), larger positive feedback of polarization, and larger fiber spacing promote more occurrences of cells walking past one another. We can capture this behavior using a simple linear stability analysis on the cell-cell interface upon collision.</p>

            <p>Simulations of nematohydrodynamics on graphics processing units (GPUs) are typically performed using double precision, which ensures accuracy but significantly increases computational cost. However, consumer-grade GPUs are optimized for single-precision calculations, making double-precision simulations inefficient on widely available hardware. In this work, we demonstrate that single-precision simulations can achieve the same accuracy as double-precision methods while delivering a 27-fold increase in computational speed. To achieve this, we introduce two key improvements: (i) the shifted distribution function in the lattice Boltzmann method, which mitigates precision loss at low velocities, and (ii) the use of larger time steps in the finite-difference solver, which reduces numerical errors and improves overall accuracy. We find that, unlike in double precision, accuracy in single-precision simulations follows a non-monotonic trend with respect to the finite-difference time step, revealing an optimal regime for precise computations. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we simulate the dynamics of single and multiple skyrmionic tubes in Poiseuille flow. Our results confirm that optimized single-precision simulations enable fast and accurate modeling of complex nematohydrodynamic systems, making large-scale simulations feasible on standard gaming GPUs.</p>

            <p>Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g., materials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches primarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models, each offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations. Autoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to multimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like VQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their direct application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high precision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other hand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data, such as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy. Yet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as general-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we propose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token prediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the strengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional diffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision of autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on material and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in state-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and establishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure prediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX demonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences for complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for scientific data generation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonín Jaroš, Michael S. Seifner, Johann Toyfl, Benjamin Czasch, Isobel C. Bicket, Philipp Haslinger</p>
            <p>We present a novel method that combines spin resonance spectroscopy with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enabling localized in-situ detection of microwave (MW)-driven spin excitations. Our approach utilizes continuous wave MW excitation at GHz frequencies, while employing the free-space electron beam as a signal receiver to sense spin precession. Spin state polarization is achieved via the magnetic field of the TEM's polepiece, while a custom-designed microresonator integrated into a TEM sample holder drives spin transitions and modulates the electron beam. This modulation enables phase-locked detection with picosecond temporal resolution, allowing the isolation of spin precession contributions to the electron beam deflection with a sensitivity of $\sim 280$ prad. The presented technique lays foundations for the MW spectroscopic in-situ exploration of spin dynamics at the nanoscale.</p>

            <h2>Towards low-dimensionalization of four-dimensional QCD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kei Tohme (Kyoto U.), Hideo Suganuma (Kyoto U.)</p>
            <p>Inspired by the one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube in a hadron, we propose a possible way of low-dimensionalization of 4D QCD. As a strategy, we use gauge degrees of freedom and propose a new gauge fixing of ``dimensional reduction (DR) gauge". The DR gauge is defined so as to minimize $R_{\rm DR} \equiv \int d^4s~{\rm Tr}~[A^2_x(s)+A^2_y(s)]$, which preserves the 2D SU($N_{c}$) gauge symmetry. We investigate low-dimensionalization properties of 4D DR-gauged QCD in SU(3) lattice QCD at $\beta$ = 6.0. In the DR gauge, the amplitudes of two gluon components $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed, and these components have a large effective mass of $M_{\perp} \simeq 1.7$ GeV. In the DR gauge, the static interquark potential is well reproduced only with the two components $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$, while $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ seem to be inactive. We investigate the spatial correlation of two $t$-directed gluons and find that the correlation decreases as $e^{-mr}$ with $m \simeq$ 0.64 GeV, corresponding to the correlation length $\xi \equiv 1/m \simeq$ 0.31 fm. We reduce 4D QCD in the DR gauge to 2D QCD with the coupling $g_{2D} = g/\xi$, which approximately reproduces the string tension.</p>

            <h2>Probing Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhinav Sinha, Trideb Shit, Avinash Tetarwal, Diptiman Sen, Sebabrata Mukherjee</p>
            <p>The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic inter-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajesh Kumar Gupta, Meenu</p>
            <p>In this article, we investigate the thermal properties of non-relativistic many-body systems at finite temperature and chemical potential. We compute the one-point function of various operators constructed out of the basic fields in ideal bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. The one-point function is non-zero only for operators with zero particle numbers. We investigate these operators in $\mathbb R^d$ and $\mathbb R^d_{+}$, i.e. a flat space with a planar boundary. Furthermore, we compute the Green's function and using the operator product expansion, we express it in terms of the thermal one-point function of the higher spin currents. On $\mathbb R^d_{+}$, the operator product expansion allows to express the bulk-bulk Green's function in terms of the thermal Green's function of the boundary operators. We also study the ideal system by placing it on curved spatial surfaces, specifically spherical surfaces. We compute the partition function and Green's function on spheres, squashed-sphere and hemispheres. Finally, we compute the large radius corrections to the partition function and Green's function by expanding in the large radius limit.</p>

            <h2>Quasiparticle poisoning of superconducting qubits with active gamma irradiation</h2>

            <p>When a high-energy particle, such as a $\gamma$-ray or muon, impacts the substrate of a superconducting qubit chip, large numbers of electron-hole pairs and phonons are created. The ensuing dynamics of the electrons and holes changes the local offset-charge environment for qubits near the impact site. The phonons that are produced have energy above the superconducting gap in the films that compose the qubits, leading to quasiparticle excitations above the superconducting ground state when the phonons impinge on the qubit electrodes. An elevated density of quasiparticles degrades qubit coherence, leading to errors in qubit arrays. Because these pair-breaking phonons spread throughout much of the chip, the errors can be correlated across a large portion of the array, posing a significant challenge for quantum error correction. In order to study the dynamics of $\gamma$-ray impacts on superconducting qubit arrays, we use a $\gamma$-ray source outside the dilution refrigerator to controllably irradiate our devices. By using charge-sensitive transmon qubits, we can measure both the offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning due to the $\gamma$ irradiation at different doses. We study correlations between offset-charge shifts and quasiparticle poisoning for different qubits in the array and compare this with numerical modeling of charge and phonon dynamics following a $\gamma$-ray impact. We thus characterize the poisoning footprint of these impacts and quantify the performance of structures for mitigating phonon-mediated quasiparticle poisoning.</p>

            <h2>Concentration via Metastable Mixing, with Applications to the Supercritical Exponential Random Graph Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vilas Winstein</p>
            <p>It is a folklore belief that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We prove a rigorous version of this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. To do this, we first present a new general result deriving concentration inequalities in a metastable well from the metastable mixing of a Markov chain with the appropriate stationary distribution, extending a result of Chatterjee [Cha05] which is suited for more traditional forms of global mixing. We then apply this result to the supercritical (low-temperature) ERGM which was recently proven to exhibit metastable mixing by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani [BNN24], and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the supercritical ERGM conditioned on a large metastable well, answering a question posed by [BNN24]. This extends a result of Ganguly and Nam [GN24] from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to a metastable well in the supercritical regime, and we are also able to extend the applications of their concentration inequality to these metastable wells. Namely, we obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate Erdős-Rényi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the count of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we also discuss the results of what appears to be the first simulation study of a metastable well in the supercritical ERGM.</p>

            <h2>Spatial Chern-Simons Interactions and Complex Magnetic Penetration Depth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yong Tao</p>
            <p>This paper examines the Landau-Ginzburg theory in the presence of spatial Chern-Simons interactions, which typically emerge in Weyl semimetals due to domain-wall motion. We demonstrate that the incorporation of a purely spatial Chern-Simons term, which violates parity, into the Landau-Ginzburg free energy leads to a complex magnetic penetration depth. This characteristic indicates that, aside from possessing an effective penetration depth, the magnetic field on the surface of the superconductor experiences periodic spatial oscillations, which significantly deviates from the conventional Meissner effect. In particular, we observe that as the degree of parity breaking, quantified by the strength of the spatial Chern-Simons term, increases, a vortex solution with magnetic field inversion may emerge. With the discovery of superconductivity in certain Weyl semimetals, we anticipate the possibility of experimentally observing this phenomenon in these materials.</p>

            <h2>Computation of Burgers Vectors from Elastic Strain and Lattice Rotation Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacques Cloete, Edmund Tarleton, Felix Hofmann</p>
            <p>A theoretical framework for computation of Burgers vectors from strain and lattice rotation data in materials with low dislocation density is presented, as well as implementation into a computer program to automate the process. The efficacy of the method is verified using simulated data of dislocations with known results. A three-dimensional dataset retrieved from Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) and a two-dimensional dataset from high-resolution transmission Kikuchi diffraction (HR-TKD) are used as inputs to demonstrate the reliable identification of dislocation positions and accurate determination of Burgers vectors from experimental data. For BCDI data, the results found using our approach show very close agreement to those expected from empirical methods. For the HR-TKD data, the predicted dislocation position and the computed Burgers vector showed fair agreement with the expected result, which is promising considering the substantial experimental uncertainties in this dataset. The method reported in this paper provides a general and robust framework for determining dislocation position and associated Burgers vector, and can be readily applied to data from different experimental techniques.</p>

            <p>Feshbach resonances play a vital role in the success of cold atoms investigating strongly-correlated physics. The recent observation of their solid-state analog in the scattering of holes and intralayer excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides [Schwartz et al., Science 374, 336 (2021)] holds compelling promise for bringing fully controllable interactions to the field of semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate how tunneling-induced layer hybridization can lead to the emergence of two distinct classes of Feshbach resonances in atomically thin semiconductors. Based on microscopic scattering theory we show that these two types of Feshbach resonances allow to tune interactions between electrons and both short-lived intralayer, as well as long-lived interlayer excitons. We predict the exciton-electron scattering phase shift from first principles and show that the exciton-electron coupling is fully tunable from strong to vanishing interactions. The tunability of interactions opens the avenue to explore Bose-Fermi mixtures in solid-state systems in regimes that were previously only accessible in cold atom experiments.</p>

            <p>Mammalian cell polarization and motility are important processes involved in many physiological and pathological phenomena, such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. The traditional view of mammalian cell motility suggests that molecular motors, adhesion, and cell deformation are all necessary components for mammalian cell movement. However, experiments on immune system cells have shown that the inhibition of molecular motors does not significantly affect cell motility. We present a new theory and simulations demonstrating that actin polymerization alone is sufficient to induce spontaneously cell polarity accompanied by the retrograde flow. These findings provide a new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of cell movement and at the same time provide a simple mechanism for cell motility in diverse configurations, e.g. on an adherent substrate, in a non-adherent matrix, or in liquids.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanja Duric, Jia Hui Chung, Bo Yang, Pinaki Sengupta</p>
            <p>Spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet (AFM) is one of the most studied models in frustrated magnetism since it is a promising candidate to host exotic spin liquid states. However, despite numerous studies using both analytical and numerical approaches, the nature of the ground state and low-energy excitations in this system remain elusive. This is related to the difficulty in determining the spin gap in various calculations. We present the results of our investigation of the Kagome AFM using the recently developed group equivariant convolutional neural networks, a novel machine learning technique for studying strongly frustrated models. The approach, combined with variational Monte Carlo, introduces significant improvement of the achievable results accuracy for frustrated spin systems in comparison with approaches based on other neural network architectures. Contrary to the results obtained previously with various methods, that predicted $Z_2$ or U(1) Dirac spin liquid states, our results strongly indicate that the ground state of the kagome lattice antiferromagnet is a spinon pair density wave that does not break time-reversal symmetry or any of the lattice symmetries. The found state appears due to the spinon Cooper pairing instability close to two Dirac points in the spinon energy spectrum and resembles the pair density wave state studied previously in the context of underdoped cuprate superconductors in connection with the pseudogap phase. The state has significantly lower energy than the lowest energy states found by the SU(2) symmetric density matrix renormalization group calculations and other methods.</p>

            <p>Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$ (LZC) is a promising solid-state electrolyte due to its affordability, moisture stability, and high ionic conductivity. We computationally investigate the role of cation disorder in LZC and its effect on Li-ion transport by integrating thermodynamic and kinetic modeling. The results demonstrate that fast Li-ion conductivity requires Li/vacancy disorder, which is dependent on the degree of Zr disorder. The high temperature required to form equilibrium Zr-disorder precludes any equilibrium synthesis processes for achieving fast Li-ion conductivity, rationalizing why only non-equilibrium synthesis methods, such as ball milling, lead to good conductivity. Our simulations show that Zr disorder lowers the Li/vacancy order-disorder transition temperature, which is necessary for creating high Li diffusivity at room temperature. These insights raise a challenge for the large-scale production of these materials and the potential for the long-term stability of their properties.</p>

            <h2>Piezoresistivity as a Fingerprint of Ferroaxial Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ezra Day-Roberts, Rafael M. Fernandes, Turan Birol</p>
            <p>Recent progress in the understanding of the collective behavior of electrons and ions have revealed new types of ferroic orders beyond ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, such as the ferroaxial state. The latter retains only rotational symmetry around a single axis and reflection symmetry with respect to a single mirror plane, both of which are set by an emergent electric toroidal dipole moment. Due to this unusual symmetry-breaking pattern, it has been challenging to directly measure the ferroaxial order parameter, despite the increasing attention this state has drawn. Here, we show that off-diagonal components of the piezoresistivity tensor (i.e., the linear change in resistivity under strain) transform the same way as the ferroaxial moments, providing a direct probe of such order parameters. We identify two new proper ferroaxial materials through a materials database search, and use first-principles calculations to evaluate the piezoconductivity of the double-perovskite CaSnF$_6$, revealing its connection to ferroaxial order and to octahedral rotation modes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis Hardt, Reza Doostani, Sebastian Diehl, Nina del Ser, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>Many-particle systems driven out of thermal equilibrium can show properties qualitatively different from any thermal state. Here, we study a ferrimagnet in a weak oscillating magnetic field. In this model, domain walls are not static, but are shown to move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Thus they act like self-propelling units. Their collective behaviour is reminiscent of other systems with actively moving units studied in the field of 'active matter', where, e.g., flocks of birds are investigated. The active motion of the domain walls emerges from 'dynamical frustration'. The antiferromagnetic xy-order rotates clockwise or anticlockwise, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. This necessarily leads to frustration at a domain wall, which gets resolved by propelling the domain wall with a velocity proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. This motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. The dynamical frustration furthermore makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven one-dimensional system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabian L. Thiemann, Camille Scalliet, Erich A. Müller, Angelos Michaelides</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material's morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalises puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a new class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Calixto, Octavio Castaños</p>
            <p>Quantum information measures are proposed to analyze the structure of near-gap electronic states in HgTe quantum wells in a strip geometry $(x,y)\in (-\infty,\infty)\times [0,L]$ of finite width $L$. This allows us to establish criteria for distinguishing edge from bulk states in the topological insulator phase, including the transition region and cutoff of the wave number $k_x$ where edge states degenerate with bulk states. Qualitative and quantitative information on the near-gap Hamiltonian eigenstates, obtained by tight-binding calculations, is extracted from localization measures, like the inverse participation ratio (IPR), and entanglement entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) to the spin sector, measuring quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The analysis of IPR and entanglement entropies in terms of spin, wave number $k_x$ and position $y$, evidences a spin polarization structure and spatial confinement of near-gap wave functions at the boundaries $y=0,L$ and low $k_x$, as correspond to helical edge states. IPR localization measures provide momentum $k_x$ cutoffs from which near-gap states are no longer localized at the boundaries of the sample and become part of the bulk. Below this $k_x$-point cutoff, the entanglement entropy and the spin probabilities of the RDM also capture the spin polarization structure of edge states and exhibit a higher variability compared to the relatively low entropy of the bulk state region.</p>

            <h2>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonathan Classen-Howes, Riccardo Senese, Abhishodh Prakash</p>
            <p>We argue for the existence of a universal phase diagram of quantum chains with range-$k$ interactions subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment. These systems exhibit "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert-space-fragmented phases as the charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that for any $d$, any state for $\nu<\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages", which we define as subregions of the chain across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. Some blockages arise from sequences of frozen sites, i.e. sites with an unchanging on-site charge, while others do not involve frozen sites at all. We prove that the presence of blockages implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov subspaces that each form an exponentially vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical eigenstates at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement entropy, with rare "inverse quantum many-body scar" eigenstates featuring non-area-law scaling. We also numerically show that for $\nu>\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We analytically derive some critical exponents characterizing the transition, and numerically determine the density of blockages at $\nu=\nu_c$, with clear implications for transport at the critical point. Finally, we investigate the properties of certain special-case models for which no phase transitions occur.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sha Jin, Xue Fan, Matteo Baggioli</p>
            <p>The lack of a well-defined equilibrium reference configuration has long hindered a comprehensive atomic-level understanding of liquid dynamics and properties. The Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) approach, which involves diagonalizing the Hessian matrix of potential energy in instantaneous liquid configurations, has emerged as a promising framework in this direction. However, several conceptual challenges remain, particularly related to the approach's inability to capture anharmonic effects. In this study, we present a set of "experimental facts" through a comprehensive INM analysis of simulated systems, including Ar, Xe, N$_2$, CS$_2$, Ga, and Pb, across a wide temperature range from the solid to gas phase. First, we examine the INM density of states (DOS) and compare it to the DOS obtained from the velocity auto-correlation function. We then analyze the temperature dependence of the fraction of unstable modes and the low-frequency slope of the INM DOS in search of potential universal behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between INMs and other properties of liquids, including the liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover and the momentum gap of collective shear waves. In addition, we investigate the INM spectrum at low temperatures as the system approaches the solid phase, revealing a significant fraction of unstable modes even in crystalline solids. Finally, we confirm the existence of a recently discussed cusp-like singularity in the INM eigenvalue spectrum and uncover its complex temperature-dependent behavior, challenging current theoretical models.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</p>

            <p>We numerically study two-dimensional active nematics with periodic activity patterning. For stripes of activity, we observe a transition from two-dimensional to one-dimensional active turbulence as the maximum active force and distance between activity stripes increases, followed by a transition to stable vortices ordered antiferromagnetically along the stripes and ferromagnetically transverse to the stripes. By comparing to a triangular lattice of activity circles, we find that transitions to two-dimensional active turbulence emerge from interplays between the active length scale and activity density, independent of the patterning geometry. The vortex ordering, on the other hand, is highly sensitive to patterning geometry, which we show by comparing the activity stripes to columns of activity circles, where the vortex ordering is lost. Our results provide a mechanism for inducing non-equilibrium phase transitions in active nematics using activity inhomogeneity, which can be further exploited to create activity patterned ordered phases.</p>

            <h2>Physical aspects of symmetry breaking in non-interacting Bose gases at thermal equilibrium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexej Schelle</p>
            <p>The theory of non-interacting Bose gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases in the limit of fluctuating particle numbers, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. Coherently coupling condensate and non-condensate parts as a direct consequence of the increasing quantum coherence time between the different quantum field components in the Bose gas from cooling to below the critical temperature, the present model describes symmetry breaking, which is originally known from the definition of a specific gauge field from Elitzur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a global physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</p>

            <h2>Force-current structure in Markovian open quantum systems and its applications: geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition and thermodynamic trade-off relations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kohei Yoshimura, Yoh Maekawa, Ryuna Nagayama, Sosuke Ito</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic force and irreversible current are the foundational concepts of classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Entropy production rate is provided by their product in classical systems, ranging from mesoscopic to macroscopic systems. However, there is no complete quantum extension of such a structure that respects quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose anti-Hermitian operators that represent currents and forces accompanied by a gradient structure in open quantum systems described by the quantum master equation. We prove that the entropy production rate is given by the product of the force and current operators, which extends the canonical expression of the entropy production rate in the classical systems. The framework constitutes a comprehensive analogy with the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of discrete classical systems. We also show that the structure leads to the extensions of some results in stochastic thermodynamics: the geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition of entropy production and thermodynamic trade-off relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the dissipation-time uncertainty relation. In discussing the trade-off relations, we will introduce a measure of fluctuation, which we term the quantum diffusivity.</p>

            <h2>Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Hossein Masoudi, Ali Naji</p>
            <p>We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (microagents), which self-propel through a rotating potential barrier in a static, viscous, fluid background. The microagent's motion begins at a specified origin and terminates at a designated destination. The potential barrier is modeled as a localized, repulsive Gaussian potential with finite support, whose peak location rotates at a given angular velocity about a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use the Advantage Actor-Critic approach to train microagents for their origin-to-destination navigation through the barrier. By employing this approach, we demonstrate that the rotating potential (as opposed to a static one) enables size-based sorting and separation of the microagents. In other words, microagents of different radii arrive at the destination at sufficiently well-separated average times, facilitating their sorting. The efficiency of particle sorting is quantified by introducing specific separation measures. We also demonstrate how training the microagents in a noisy background, as opposed to a noise-free one, can improve the precision of their size-based sorting. Our findings suggest promising avenues for future research on smart active particles equipped with deep reinforcement learning to navigate complex environments, particularly in microscale applications.</p>

This state can be efficiently described by a Gutzwiller-projected parton theory characterized by its projective symmetry group. To distinguish the difference between the projected Z$_2$ and U(1) parton state, we investigate the chiral spin liquid ground states as topological orders by incorporating a $J_\chi$ term into the $J_1$-$J_2$ model and observe a transition from a Z$_2$ chiral spin liquid to a U(1)$_2$ chiral spin liquid as $J_\chi$ increases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emile Pangburn, Catherine Pépin, Anurag Banerjee</p>
            <p>We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.</p>

            <h2>Self-diffusive dynamics of active Brownian particles at moderate densities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Soto</p>
            <p>The Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model has become a prototype of self-propelled particles. ABPs move persistently at a constant speed $V$ along a direction that changes slowly by rotational diffusion, characterized by a coefficient $\Dr$. Persistent motion plus random reorientations generate a random walk at long times with a diffusion coefficient that, for isolated ABPs in two dimensions, is given by $D_0=V^2/(2\Dr)$. Here we study the density effects on the self-diffusive dynamics using a recently proposed kinetic theory for ABPs, in which persistent collisions are described as producing a net displacement on the particles. On intermediate timescales, where many collisions have taken place but the director of the tracer particle has not yet changed, it is possible to solve the Lorentz kinetic equation for a tracer particle. It turns out that, as a result of collisions, the tracer follows an effective stochastic dynamics, characterized by an effective reduced streaming velocity $V_\text{eff}$ and anisotropic diffusion, with coefficients explicitly depending on the density. Based on this result, an effective theoretical and numerical approach is proposed in which the particles in a bath follow stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions based on the local density. Finally, on time scales larger than $\Dr^{-1}$, studying the van Hove function at small wavevectors, it is shown that the tracer particle presents an effective diffusive motion with a coefficient $D=V_\text{eff}^2/(2\Dr)$. The dependence of $V_\text{eff}$ on the density indicates that the kinetic theory is limited to area fractions smaller than 0.42, and beyond this limit unphysical results appear.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qingguang Xie, Tian Du, Christoph J. Brabec, Jens Harting</p>
            <p>Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Balcerek, Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Agnieszka Wyłomańska, Diego Krapf</p>
            <p>Heterogeneous diffusion processes are prevalent in various fields, including the motion of proteins in living cells, the migratory movement of birds and mammals, and finance. These processes are often characterized by time-varying dynamics, where interactions with the environment evolve, and the system undergoes fluctuations in diffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems anomalous diffusion is observed, where the mean square displacement (MSD) exhibits non-linear scaling with time. Among the models used to describe this phenomenon, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic process, particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations. Although FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneous processes with FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. In this article, we study the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractional Brownian motion (SFBM), a model in which the diffusivity of the FBM process varies while temporal correlations are maintained. To characterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the kurtosis, a common tool used to quantify deviations from the normal distribution. We derive exact expressions for the kurtosis of the considered heterogeneous anomalous diffusion process and investigate how it can identify non-Gaussian behavior. We also compare the kurtosis results with those obtained using the Hellinger distance, a classical measure of divergence between probability density functions. Through both analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate the potential of kurtosis as a metric for detecting non-Gaussianity in heterogeneous anomalous diffusion processes.</p>

            <p>Drawing inspiration from the motility behaviour of microorganisms, we introduce a highly tunable, robotic system self-actuating into the run-and-tumble (RT)-like motion. It comprises two disk-shaped, centimeter-scale programmable robots individually programmed to perform overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion and connected by a rigid rod. The rod is attached to pivot points located on off-centered, mirror-symmetric points on each robot, allowing for its free rotation at both ends. We show that the collective dynamics of this system execute RT-like motion with characteristic sharp tumble events and exponentially distributed run times, similar to those observed in microorganisms. We further quantify emerging dynamics in terms of tumbling frequency and tune it over a wide range of experimental parameters. We also develop a theoretical model that reproduces our experimental results and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing the rich phase behavior of RT motion. Together, these results highlight the importance of our robotic platform in offering valuable insights into the mechanism of motility characteristics in microorganisms.</p>

            <p>We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles phonon calculations to study the lattice dynamics and spin-phonon coupling in the kagome spin ice compound HoAgGe. Upon cooling, HoAgGe shows transitions from a nonmagnetic state at 300 K to a partially magnetic-ordered phase below T2 = 11.6 K, eventually reaching a fully-magnetic ordered phase below T1 = 7 K. We detect eight of ten Raman-active phonon modes at room temperature, with frequencies consistent with first-principles phonon calculations. We find that the low-energy phonon modes harden upon cooling, soften slightly below T2, and finally harden again below T1, suggesting finite spin-phonon coupling in HoAgGe. Furthermore, one high-energy mode at 185 cm-1 with E' symmetry exhibits a Fano lineshape due to electron-phonon coupling. Our Raman results establish finite spin-phonon coupling and electron-phonon coupling in the magnetic phase of HoAgGe, providing a foundation for future studies of the novel field-induced phases at low temperatures in HoAgGe.</p>

In addition to the conventional charge and spin DWs, we also rigorously construct cross DW to capture mutual influences between the two degrees of freedom in transport dynamics, showing a counterintuitive subtle spin-charge coupling effect. Furthermore, we obtain explicit universal scaling laws for DWs across various phase boundaries and propose an experimental protocol to measure DWs in ultracold atomic systems.

            <p>We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</p>

This enhancement is caused by the linear dependence of the viscosity of the electron liquid on the flow velocity, which is allowed in the absence of TRS and Galilean invariance. The resulting nonlinear flows break dynamical similarity and must be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds number and the emergent nonreciprocity number. The latter is linear in velocity but independent of system size. We determine the nonlinear conductance of a Hall bar and show that the nonreciprocal correction to the current can be of comparable magnitude to its reciprocal counterpart.</p>

            <p>Uranium mononitride (UN) is a promising advanced nuclear fuel due to its high thermal conductivity and high fissile density. Yet, many aspects of its mechanical behavior and microstructural features are currently unknown. In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study UN's diffusional creep. Nanometer-sized polycrystals are used to simulate diffusional creep and to calculate an effective GB width. It is found that Nabarro-Herring creep is not dominant in the temperature range of 1700$-$2000 K and that the dominant diffusional creep mechanism is Coble creep with an activation energy of 2.28 $\pm$ 0.09 eV. A method is proposed to calculate the diffusional GB width and its temperature dependence in polycrystals. The effective GB width of UN is calculated as 2.69 $\pm$ 0.08 nm. This value fits very well with the prefactor of the phenomenological Coble creep formula. It is demonstrated that the most comprehensive thermal creep model for UN can be represented as the combination of our Coble creep model and the dislocation creep model proposed by Hayes et al.</p>

            <p>Topological insulators (TIs) are intriguing materials for advanced computing applications based on spintronics because they can host robust spin effects. For instance, TIs have intrinsically large spin generation enabled by their large spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, topological surface states (TSS) with spin-momentum locking and Dirac dispersion lead to long spin diffusion. Future spintronic device technology will require scalable film growth of high-quality material. We grow epitaxial films of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$ (BSTS, $x = 0.58, y = 1$) and confirm the gapless band structure with optimal doping using angle-resolved photoelectron spectra. The temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity shows bulk transport is suppressed as temperature is decreased, and at low temperature surface transport dominates. We evaluate the spin transport properties in BSTS without using ferromagnetic tunnel contacts via a non-local resistance experiment as a function of temperature and applied charge current. As expected, these experiments reveal the necessity of decreasing the bulk conduction to best enhance the spin transport. In the TSS, we find high efficiency of charge-to-spin conversion (spin Hall angle, $\theta_{SH} \approx 1$) and spin diffusion over several microns. Further development of high-quality TIs will make them viable candidates for efficient and lossless spintronics.</p>

In this regime, the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. The strong signal of symmetry breaking favors the onset of a pairing instability in which the electrons with opposite spin projection in the Cooper pairs live in different valleys. The Fermi lines become distorted due to the repulsive Coulomb interaction, which makes the screening highly anisotropic, leading easily to attraction in some of the interaction channels. We also show that the sheared graphene bilayers offer the possibility to realize the combined breakdown of parity and valley symmetry, making them very suitable to study the interplay between correlations and topology in a two-dimensional electron system.</p>

            <p>In 1993 Keski-Vakkuri and Wen introduced a model for the fractional quantum Hall effect based on multilayer two-dimensional electron systems satisfying quasi-periodic boundary conditions. Such a model is essentially specified by a choice of a complex torus $E$ and a symmetric positively definite matrix $K$ of size $g$ with positive integral coefficients. The space of the corresponding wave functions turns out to be $\delta$-dimensional, where $\delta$ is the determinant of $K$. We construct a hermitian holomorphic bundle of rank $\delta$ on the abelian variety $A$ (which is the $g$-fold product of the torus $E$ with itself), whose fibres can be identified with the space of wave function of Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. A rigorous construction of this "magnetic bundle" involves the technique of Fourier-Mukai transforms on abelian varieties. This bundle turns out to be simple and semi-homogeneous. This bundle can be equipped with two different (and natural) hermitian metrics: the one coming from the center-of-mass dynamics and the one coming from the Hilbert space of the underlying many-body system. We prove that the canonical Bott-Chern connection of the first hermitian metric is always projectively flat and give sufficient conditions for this property for the second hermitian metric.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Józef Kuśba</p>
            <p>To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</p>

            <p>Quantum information theory is plagued by the problem of regularisations, which require the evaluation of formidable asymptotic quantities. This makes it computationally intractable to gain a precise quantitative understanding of the ultimate efficiency of key operational tasks such as entanglement manipulation. Here we consider the problem of computing the asymptotic entanglement cost of preparing noisy quantum states under quantum operations with positive partial transpose (PPT). By means of an analytical example, a previously claimed solution to this problem is shown to be incorrect. Building on a previous characterisation of the PPT entanglement cost in terms of a regularised formula, we construct instead a hierarchy of semi-definite programs that bypasses the issue of regularisation altogether, and converges to the true asymptotic value of the entanglement cost. Our main result establishes that this convergence happens exponentially fast, thus yielding an efficient algorithm that approximates the cost up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(D,\,\log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $D$ is the underlying Hilbert space dimension. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an asymptotic entanglement measure is shown to be efficiently computable despite no closed-form formula being available.</p>

However, observation of quantum statistical properties of microwave photons remains demanding: The energy of several microwave photons is considerably smaller than the thermal fluctuation of any room-temperature detector, while amplification necessarily induces noise. Here, we present a measurement technique with a nanobolometer that directly measures the photon statistics at the millikelvin temperature and overcomes this trade-off. We apply our method to thermal states generated by a blackbody radiator operating in the regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate the photon number resolvedness of the nanobolometer, and reveal the n(n+1)-scaling law of the photon number variance as indicated by the Bose--Einstein distribution. By engineering the coherent and incoherent proportions of the input field, we observe the transition between super-Poissonian and Poissonian statistics of the microwave photons from the bolometric second-order correlation measurement. This technique is poised to serve in fundamental tests of quantum mechanics with microwave photons and function as a scalable readout solution for a quantum information processor.</p>

            <h2>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongye Yu, Tzu-Chieh Wei</p>
            <p>We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experimental implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces of definite charges are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization cannot be used to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework for the robustness of DTCs from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is rigorously proved if the system satisfies a certain condition where the mixing length, defined by the Hamming distance of the symmetry charges, does not exceed a global threshold. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing DTCs realized by kicking disordered systems, where conventional MBL-DTCs can be regarded as a special case of the subspace-thermal DTC with the subspace dimension being one, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to systems with higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as to higher spatial dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Inductively coupled Josephson junctions: a platform for rich neuromorphic dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Baxevanis, J. Hizanidis</p>
            <p>Josephson junctions (JJs) are by nature neuromorphic hardware devices capable of mimicking excitability and spiking dynamics. When coupled together or combined with other superconducting elements, they can emulate additional behaviors found in biological neurons. From a technological point of view, JJ-based neuromorphic systems are particularly appealing since they present THz-speed processing and they operate with near-zero power dissipation. In this work we study a system of inductively coupled JJs and focus on the nonlinear dynamical aspects of its neurocomputational properties. In particular, we report on spiking behavior related to a saddle-node \emph{off} invariant cycle bifurcation and excitability type \RNum{2}, synchronization, first spike latency effects, and multistability. Special emphasis is placed on the bursting dynamics the system is capable of reproducing, and a new underlying mechanism is proposed beyond the approach followed in prior works.</p>

            <h2>Local Quenches from a Krylov Perspective</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pawel Caputa, Giuseppe Di Giulio</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$ as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic spectrum is sensitively controlled by light-driven quantum interferences between the interband valley resonances and intraband currents originating from electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, also away from K/K' valleys such as $\Gamma$ and M. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Molignini</p>
            <p>Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</p>

            <h2>Revealing Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Quantum Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiyang Jiang, Tobias Holder, Binghai Yan</p>
            <p>Berry curvature-related topological phenomena have been a central topic in condensed matter physics. Yet, until recently other quantum geometric quantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due to the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review gives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the nonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection with excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical processes. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into nonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena. Such a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of the underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the electron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift currents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their respective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these resonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity that shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the role of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents a window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state correlation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous motion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear transport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between quantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising probes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex materials.</p>

            <h2>The singlet-triplet and exchange-only flopping-mode spin qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Stastny, Guido Burkard</p>
            <p>Semiconductor-based spin qubits embedded into a superconducting microwave cavity constitute a fast-progressing and promising platform for realizing fast and fault-tolerant qubit control with long-range two-qubit coupling. The flopping-mode spin qubit consists of a single electron in a double quantum dot; it combines a charge qubit with a spin qubit. With its strong and tunable cavity coupling, the flopping-mode qubit is proven to be well-suited for low-power qubit control and cavity-mediated long-range quantum gates. The singlet-triplet (ST) and exchange-only (EO) qubits are multi-electron realizations that go without broadband control and are protected from some types of noise, but are challenging to couple to each other and to microwave cavities. We combine the flopping-mode concept with the ST and EO qubits and propose two new flopping-mode qubits that consist of three (four) quantum dots, occupied by two (three) electrons near the (1,0,1) - (0,1,1) [(1,0,1,1) -- (0,1,1,1)] charge transition. The two-electron system augments the $ST_0$ spin qubit with a charge qubit that interacts transversally and longitudinally with a cavity. Both couplings are highly tunable, and the longitudinal coupling distinguishes the flopping-mode ST qubit from the regular flopping-mode qubit. The longitudinal coupling allows for non-dissipative universal control similar to superconducting transmon qubits. The EO flopping-mode qubit comprises four dots occupied by three electrons and opens a new possibility to perform two-qubit gates for EO qubits that are challenging to perform directly with the exchange coupling. We use input-output theory to provide means of extracting the coupling strengths from cavity transmission data.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Ru-doping on the magnetism of Ag3LiIr2O6, a candidate Kitaev quantum spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjay Bachhar, M. Baenitz, John Wilkinson, A.V. Mahajan</p>
            <p>We report our investigations on Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6, which results from the Ru substitution in the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Ag3LiIr2O6. It crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group like its parent compound, Ag3LiIr2O6. Our susceptibility measurements reveal an effective moment = 2.6 muB, which is higher than the moments of the parent compound and less than that of the Ru-analog (Ag3LiRu2O6), suggesting the presence of magnetic Ir4+ (Jeff= 1/2) and Ru4+ (S=1). Bulk magnetic susceptibility suggests long-range order (LRO)at T~20 K, whereas no clear signature is present in the heat capacity. Likewise, there is a loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity around T~20 K as expected at the onset of LRO, but a complete wipe-out is not seen in contrast to the result in Ag3LiIr2O6. There is also a T~20 K anomaly in the 7Li NMR relaxation rate and also a fall in the 7Li NMR shift with decreasing temperature. These results suggest LRO at T~20 K in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6. However, at low-T below 10 K, we observe a power law variation in magnetic heat capacity and spin lattice relaxation rate, temperature-independent-7K, and no further loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity. These results might suggest the persistence or stabilisation of a quantum spin liquid-like phase, perhaps from a fraction of the sample in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6 below 10 K. Our muon spin relaxation measurements suggest ordering around 20 K, consistent with our other probes. It appears that the main effect of Ru-substitution is to shift the LRO to a higher temperature in comparison with Ag3LiIr2O6, though there are signatures of a novel phase below about 10 K.</p>

            <p>Coherent light-matter interactions between a quantum gas and light in a high-finesse cavity can drive self-ordering phase transitions. To date, such phenomena have involved exclusively single-atom coupling to light, resulting in coupled charge-density or spin-density wave and superradiant order. In this work, we engineer simultaneous coupling of cavity photons to both single atoms and fermionic pairs, which are also mutually coupled due to strong correlations in the unitary Fermi gas. This interplay gives rise to an interference between the charge-density wave and a pair-density wave, where the short-range pair correlation function is spontaneously modulated in space. We observe this effect by tracking the onset of superradiance as the photon-pair coupling is varied in strength and sign, revealing constructive or destructive interference of the three orders with a coupling mediated by strong light-matter and atom-atom interactions. Our observations are compared with mean-field theory where the coupling strength between atomic- and pair-density waves is controlled by higher-order correlations in the Fermi gas. These results demonstrate the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics to produce and observe exotic orders in strongly correlated matter, paving the way for the quantum simulation of complex quantum matter using ultracold atoms.</p>

            <h2>Spin Seebeck Effect as a Probe for Majorana Fermions in Kitaev Spin Liquids</h2>

            <p>Quantum entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems often leads to exotic elementary excitations. Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) provide a paradigmatic example, where the elementary excitations are described by fractional quasiparticles such as spinons. However, such fractional quasiparticles behave differently from electrons, making their experimental identification challenging. Here, we theoretically investigate the spin Seebeck effect, which is a thermoelectric response via a spin current, as an efficient probe of the fractional quasiparticles in QSLs, focusing on the Kitaev honeycomb model. By comprehensive studies using the real-time dynamics, the perturbation theory, and the linear spin-wave theory based on the tunnel spin-current theory, we find that the spin current is induced by thermal gradient in the Kitaev spin liquid, via the low-energy fractional Majorana excitations. This underscores the ability of Majorana fermions to carry spin current, despite lacking spin angular momentum. Furthermore, we find that the induced spin current changes its sign depending on the sign of the Kitaev interaction, indicating that the Majorana fermions contribute to the spin current with (up-)down-spin like nature when the exchange coupling is (anti)ferromagnetic. Thus, in contrast to the negative spin current already found in a one-dimensional QSL, our finding reveals that the spin Seebeck effect can exhibit either positive or negative signals, contingent upon the nature of fractional excitations in the QSLs. We also clarify contrasting field-angle dependence between the Kitaev spin liquid in the low-field limit and the high-field ferromagnetic state, which is useful for the experimental identification. Our finding suggests that the spin Seebeck effect could be used not only to detect fractional quasiparticles emerging in QSLs but also to generate and control them.</p>

            <p>Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.</p>

            <p>We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during the process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We go beyond Chandrasekhar's ideas and not only consider a white dwarf itself as a quantum object, but also describe the dynamics of a produced accretion disk in a quantum way. We model the white dwarf star as a Bose-Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate the evolution of the black hole-white dwarf binary system. While going through the periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin et al. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disk, formed due to stripping of the white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.</p>

            <p>An exactly solvable Kitaev model in a two-dimensional square lattice exhibits a topological quantum phase transition which is different from the symmetry-breaking transition at zero temperature. When the ground state of a nonlinearly perturbed Kitaev model with different strengths of perturbation taken as the initial state is quenched to a pure Kitaev model, we demonstrate that various features of the dynamical state, such as the Loschmidt echo and time-averaged multipartite entanglement, can determine whether the initial state belongs to the topological phase or not. Moreover, the derivatives of the dynamical quantifiers can faithfully identify the topological quantum phase transition, which is present at equilibrium. When the individual qubits of the lattice interact with the local thermal bath repeatedly, we observe that block entanglement in dissipative dynamics can nevertheless distinguish the equilibrium phases from which the system starts evolution.</p>

            <p>We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to systematically characterize gapped phases in 2+1 dimensions with categorical symmetries. The SymTFTs that we consider are (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups $G$, whose gapped boundaries realize all so-called ``All Bosonic type" fusion 2-category symmetries. In arXiv:2408.05266 we provided the general framework and studied the case where $G$ is an abelian group. In this work we focus on the case of non-Abelian $G$. Gapped boundary conditions play a central role in the SymTFT construction of symmetric gapped phases. These fall into two broad families: minimal and non-minimal boundary conditions, respectively. The first kind corresponds to boundaries on which all line operators are obtainable as boundary projections of bulk line operators. The symmetries on such boundaries include (anomalous) 2-groups and 2-representation categories of 2-groups. Conversely non-minimal boundaries contain line operators that are intrinsic to the boundaries. The symmetries on such boundaries correspond to fusion 2-categories where modular tensor categories intertwine non-trivially with the above symmetry types. We discuss in detail the generalized charges of these symmetries and their condensation patterns that give rise to a zoo of rich beyond-Landau gapped phases. Among these are phases that exhibit novel patterns of symmetry breaking wherein the symmetry broken vacua carry distinct kinds of topological order. We exemplify this framework for the case where $G$ is a dihedral group.</p>

            <p>We study the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory coupled to soft-core bosonic matter at unit filling, inspired by the Higgs sector of the standard model. Through a combination of analytical perturbative approaches, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix-renormalization-group simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram driven by gauge-field-mediated resonant pair hopping and the confinement of single particles. The pair hopping results in a bunching state with superextensive energy and macroscopic particle number fluctuations at strong electric field strengths and weak on-site interactions. The bunching state crosses over into a pair superfluid phase as the on-site interaction increases, characterized by a finite superfluid density and powerlaw-decaying pair correlations. At large on-site interaction strengths and driven by effective interactions induced by the gauge constraint, the superfluid transitions into an incompressible pair Mott insulator phase. At weak field strengths and on-site interactions, we find a plasma-like region, where single bosons exhibit large short-range correlations and the ground state is composed almost equally of states with even and odd local boson occupation. The presence of a bunching state with large number fluctuations, which is difficult to study using classical numerics, motivates experimental realizations in hybrid boson-qubit quantum simulation platforms such as circuit QED, neutral atoms, and trapped ions. Our findings highlight the rich interplay between gauge fields and soft-core bosonic matter.</p>

            <p>The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ki Young Lee, Stephan Wong, Sachin Vaidya, Terry A. Loring, Alexander Cerjan</p>
            <p>The moire flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene have attracted considerable attention not only because of the emergence of correlated phases but also due to their nontrivial topology. Specifically, they exhibit a new class of topology that can be nullified by the addition of trivial bands, termed fragile topology, which suggests the need for an expansion of existing classification schemes. Here, we develop a Z2 energy-resolved topological marker for classifying fragile phases using a system's position-space description, enabling the direct classification of finite, disordered, and aperiodic materials. By translating the physical symmetries protecting the system's fragile topological phase into matrix symmetries of the system's Hamiltonian and position operators, we use matrix homotopy to construct our topological marker while simultaneously yielding a quantitative measure of topological robustness. We show our framework's effectiveness using a C2T-symmetric twisted bilayer graphene model and photonic crystal as a continuum example. We have found that fragile topology can persist both under strong disorder and in heterostructures lacking a bulk spectral gap, and even an example of disorder-induced re-entrant topology. Overall, the proposed scheme serves as an effective tool for elucidating aspects of fragile topology, offering guidance for potential applications across a variety of experimental platforms from topological photonics to correlated phases in materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sijia Zhao, Rong Zhang, Wen O. Wang, Jixun K. Ding, Tianyi Liu, Brian Moritz, Edwin W. Huang, Thomas P. Devereaux</p>
            <p>Numerical evidence for superconductivity in the single-band Hubbard model is elusive or ambiguous despite extensive study, raising the question of whether the single-band Hubbard model is a faithful low energy effective model for cuprates, and whether explicitly including the oxygen ions will recover the properties necessary for superconducting transition. Here we show, by using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the doped two-dimensional three-band Emery model, that while the single-band model exhibits strikingly T-linear transport behavior, the three-band model shows a low temperature resistivity curvature indicating a crossover to a more metallic transport regime. Evidence has also been found in thermodynamic and superconducting measurements, which suggests that some degree of coherence in transport might be necessary for the high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates, further implying a possible connection between superconducting and transport behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Spectral signature of periodic modulation and sliding of pseudogap state in moire system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingzhuo Han, Yingbo Wang, Yucheng Xue, Jiefei Shi, Xiaomeng Wang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jian Kang, Yuhang Jiang, Jinhai Mao</p>
            <p>The nature of the pseudogap state is widely believed as a key to understanding the pairing mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity. Over the past two decades, significant efforts have been devoted to searching for spontaneous symmetry breaking or potential order parameters associated with these pseudogap states, aiming to better characterize their properties. Recently, pseudogap states have also been realized in moire systems with extensive gate tunability, yet their local electronic structure remains largely unexplored8. In this study, we report the observation of gate-tunable spontaneous symmetry breaking and sliding behavior of the pseudogap state in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MAtBG) using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. Our spectroscopy reveals a distinct pseudogap at 4.4 K within the doping range -3 < v < -2. Spectroscopic imaging highlights a gap size modulation at moire scale that is sensitive to the filling, indicative of a wave-like fluctuating pseudogap feature. Specifically, the positions of gap size minima (GSM) coincide with regions of the highest local density of states (LDOS) at the filling v = -2.63, but a unidirectional sliding behavior of GSM is observed for other fillings. In addition, the pseudogap size distribution at certain doping levels also causes a clear nematic order, or an anisotropic gap distribution. Our results have shed light on the complex nature of this pseudogap state, revealing critical insights into the phase diagram of correlated electron systems.</p>

            <h2>Chiral currents at zero magnetic field in some two-dimensional superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chandra M. Varma</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal critical currents without applying an external magnetic field have been observed recently in several superconductors, in various forms of Graphene, a Kagome compound and in an under-doped cuprate. A necessary requirement for this is that the usual supercurrent be accompanied by a chiral super-current, i.e. with the symmetry of a hall current; equivalently that the superfluid density tensor have a chiral component. It also requires inversion breaking. The conditions for this phenomena are derived to find that their normal states must break time-reversal and chirality and that the superconducting states must in addition be non-unitary. Each of the superconductors where spontaneous non-reciprocal critical currents are observed have shown some evidence for such broken symmetries in the normal state. The superconducting state of such materials have topological edge currents, but their projected electro-magnetic part is in general not an integer. The edge states are protected in the superconductor due to a gap. Under ideal conditions, the normal state should show an anomalous Hall effect.</p>

            <h2>Square lattice model with staggered magnetic fluxes: zero Chern number topological states and topological flat bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Xiang Chen, Dong-Hao Guan, Lu Qi, Xiuyun Zhang, Ying Han, Ai-Lei He</p>
            <p>Staggered magnetic fluxes (SMF) play a crucial role in achieving Chern insulators (CIs), by which a series of CI models have been established on various lattices. In addition, SMF induced higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) in a lattice model has been reported. In this work, we propose a square lattice model with SMF. We find intracellular SMF can induce zero-Chern-number topological insulator (ZCNTI) at quarter filling which hosts topologically protected edge states characterized by the quantized polarization, in analogy to the topological state in two dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Hegger model. When lattice dimerization and intracellular SMF are introduced, there exists HOTI state at half filling. Furthermore, this model hosts topological flat band (TFB) by considering the next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. Several fractional Chern insulator states are investigated when hard-core bosons are filled into this TFB model.</p>

            <h2>Quantum metric induced magneto-optical effects in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongpan Li, Yichen Liu, Cheng-Cheng Liu</p>
            <p>The magneto-optical effects (MOEs), as a fundamental physical phenomenon, can reveal the electronic structures of materials. The related probing methods are widely used in the study of magnetic materials. However, space-time inversion ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric antiferromagnets were previously believed to be magneto-optically inactive. Here, we point out that this traditional understanding is incorrect. Based on our generic formulas and symmetry analysis, we find that in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets, it is the quantum metric, i.e., the real part of the quantum geometry, that induces MOEs. Combining a tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we confirm this observation by showing MOEs in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnet. Our work demonstrates that $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets previously thought to lack MOEs can indeed exhibit MOEs and greatly broaden the research on MOEs.</p>

            <p>Emergent symmetry breakings in condensed matter systems are often intimately linked to collective excitations. For example, the intertwined spin-charge stripe order in cuprate superconductors is associated with spin and charge excitations. While the collective behavior of spin excitations is well established, the nature of charge excitations remains to be understood. Here we present a high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge excitations in the stripe-ordered cuprate La$_{1.675}$Eu$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$. The RIXS spectra consist of both charge and phonon excitations around the charge ordering wave vector. By modeling the momentum-dependent phonon intensity, the charge-excitation spectral weight is extracted for a wide range of energy. As such, we reveal the highly dispersive nature of the charge excitations, with an energy scale comparable to the spin excitations. Since charge order and superconductivity in cuprates are possibly driven by the same electronic correlations, determining the interaction strength underlying charge order is essential to establishing a comprehensive microscopic model of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of Robust High-Temperature Superconductivity in Li3IrH9 at Moderate Pressures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wendi Zhao, Shumin Guo, Tiancheng Mg, Zhengtao Liu, Chengda Li, Defang Duan, Tian Cui</p>
            <p>The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in compressed hydrides has sparked intensive efforts to find superconducting hydrides that are stable at low pressure or even ambient pressure. Herein, we present the ternary hydride Li3IrH9 as an exceptional candidate, which exhibits thermodynamic stability above 100 GPa and dynamic stability down to 8 GPa, exhibiting a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of up to 113 K. In this structure, the broadening and overlapping between the electronic bands of the Ir-H antibonding states and the neighboring H ions result in the intrinsic metallicity of the hydrogen sublattice and drive the emergence of hydrogen-dominated significant electronic states at the Fermi level. Within this specific mechanism, the softened optical modes generated by hydrogen atoms encapsulated in the center of the Li octahedron play a critical role in strengthening electron-phonon coupling, an effect that remains robust even under high-pressures. Through high-throughput computational screening, we further identified a new family of superconductors derived from this prototype, including Li3RhH9 (Tc = 124 K at 20 GPa) and Li3CoH9 (Tc = 80 K at 10 GPa). This work provides original theoretical insights to accelerate the discovery of emerging hydride superconductor families that exhibit robust high-temperature superconductivity under moderate-pressures, along with promising potential for practical implementation.</p>

            <p>Nonlinear Hall effects have been observed in quantum materials where Berry curvature and its momentum-space derivatives, such as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) and Berry curvature triple (BCT), play a central role. While inversion symmetry breaking is widely recognized as a key criterion, the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking remains less explored. Here, we report an abrupt enhancement of nonlinear Hall conductivity in non-centrosymmetric SrRuO3 (111) thin films during the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition. Scaling analysis reveals a sign reversal of the skew scattering contribution upon time-reversal symmetry breaking, which we attribute to the sign reversal of BCT at the Fermi surface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support this interpretation, showing the spin-polarized band splitting shifts the Fermi level asymmetrically for different spin channels. Our findings establish SrRuO3 (111) thin films as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable nonlinear transport effects.</p>

            <p>The rare-earth-based geometrically frustrated triangular magnets have attracted considerable attention due to the intricate interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling and the crystal electric field (CEF), which often leads to effective spin-1/2 degrees of freedom and therefore promotes strong quantum fluctuations at low temperatures, thus offering an excellent route to stabilize a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state. We have investigated the ground state magnetic properties of a polycrystalline sample of $\text{SmTa}_7\text{O}_{19}$ which we propose to have a gapless QSL ground state by employing powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), DC and AC-magnetic susceptibility, $M$ vs. $H$ isotherm, specific heat, and muon spin rotation/relaxation measurements ($\mu$SR) down to 30 mK. The combined structural and electronic studies reveal the formation of an edge-sharing equilateral triangular lattice of Sm$^{3+}$ ions in $ab$ plane. The DC, AC magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements reveal that $\text{SmTa}_7\text{O}_{19}$ does not exhibit any long-range magnetic ordering transition down to 50 mK. The zero-field (ZF)-$\mu$SR study strongly refutes the long-range magnetically ordered ground state and/or any partial spin-freezing down to at least 30 mK. The ZF-muon-spin relaxation rate is weakly temperature dependent between 50 and 20 K, rapidly increases below $\sim$20 K and saturates at low temperatures between 2 K and 30 mK, which has been attributed to a characteristic signature of QSL systems. Further, our longitudinal-field (LF)-$\mu$SR measurements at 0.1 K reveal a dynamic nature of the magnetic ground state. In addition, our high-field specific heat data suggest a gapless nature of spin excitations in this compound.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressure on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a prototypical material for the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice with a possible spin-liquid ground state. Using ultrasound measurements at pressures up to 1.16 GPa, we reveal significant modifications of the acoustic properties and the $H$-$T$ phase diagram of this material. Hydrostatic pressure suppresses the three-dimensional magnetic order and induces a dimerization transition at higher pressures. At low pressures, the sound attenuation exhibits a linear temperature dependence, while above 0.28 GPa, it becomes nearly temperature independent, suggesting a shift in the phonon scattering regime dominated by Majorana fermions. These findings provide new insights into spin-strain interactions in Kitaev magnets and deliver a detailed characterization of the $H$-$T$ phase diagram of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under hydrostatic pressure.</p>

            <p>Charge-density-wave (CDW) materials having a strong electron-phonon coupling provide a powerful platform for investigating the intricate interplay between lattice fluctuations and a macroscopic quantum order. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES), we reveal that the CDW gap closure in VTe2 is dominated by an incoherent process evolving on a sub-picosecond timescale, challenging the conventional view that the gap dynamics is primarily governed by the excitation of the CDW amplitude modes. Our findings, supported by a three-temperature model, show that the CDW gap evolution can be described by considering the population of a subset of strongly-coupled optical phonon modes, which leads to an increase in the lattice fluctuations. This microscopic framework extends beyond VTe2, offering a universal perspective for understanding the light-induced phase transition in strongly-coupled CDW systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jafar Farhadi, Joshua B. Fernandes, Karthik Shekhar, Kranthi K. Mandadapu</p>
            <p>We present a minimal model to analyze the capacitive response of a biological membrane subjected to a step voltage via blocking electrodes. Through a perturbative analysis of the underlying electrolyte transport equations, we show that the leading-order relaxation of the transmembrane potential is governed by a capacitive timescale, ${\tau_{\rm C} =\dfrac{\lambda_{\rm D}L}{D}\left(\dfrac{2+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/L}{4+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/\lambda_{\rm D}}\right)}$, where $\lambda_{\rm D}$ is the Debye screening length, $L$ is the electrolyte width, $\Gamma$ is the ratio of the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte to the membrane, $\delta^{\rm M}$ is the membrane thickness, and $D$ is the ionic diffusivity. This timescale is considerably shorter than the traditional RC timescale ${\lambda_{\rm D} L / D}$ for a bare electrolyte due to the membrane's low dielectric permittivity and finite thickness. Beyond the linear regime, however, salt diffusion in the bulk electrolyte drives a secondary, nonlinear relaxation process of the transmembrane potential over a longer timescale ${\tau_{\rm L} =L^2/4\pi^2 D}$. A simple equivalent-circuit model accurately captures the linear behavior, and the perturbation expansion remains applicable across the entire range of observed physiological transmembrane potentials. Together, these findings underscore the importance of the faster capacitive timescale and nonlinear effects on the bulk diffusion timescale in determining transmembrane potential dynamics for a range of biological systems.</p>

            <p>We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha<1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.</p>

            <p>We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the \emph{large-scale structure of entanglement} of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.</p>

            <p>Binding free energies are a key element in understanding and predicting the strength of protein--drug interactions. While classical free energy simulations yield good results for many purely organic ligands, drugs including transition metal atoms often require quantum chemical methods for an accurate description. We propose a general and automated workflow that samples the potential energy surface with hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations and trains a machine learning (ML) potential on the QM energies and forces to enable efficient alchemical free energy simulations. To represent systems including many different chemical elements efficiently and to account for the different description of QM and MM atoms, we propose an extension of element-embracing atom-centered symmetry functions for QM/MM data as an ML descriptor. The ML potential approach takes electrostatic embedding and long-range electrostatics into account. We demonstrate the applicability of the workflow on the well-studied protein--ligand complex of myeloid cell leukemia 1 and the inhibitor 19G and on the anti-cancer drug NKP1339 acting on the glucose-regulated protein 78.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional hexagonal materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit valley degrees of freedom, offering fascinating potential for valley-based quantum computing and optoelectronics. In nonlinear optics, the K and K' valleys provide excitation resonances that can be used for ultrafast control of excitons, Bloch oscillations, and Floquet physics. Under intense laser fields, however, the role of coherent carrier dynamics away from the K/K' valleys is largely unexplored. In this study, we observe quantum interferences in high harmonic generation from monolayer $WS_2$ as laser fields drive electrons from the valleys across the full Brillouin zone. In the perturbative regime, interband resonances at the valleys enhance high harmonic generation through multi-photon excitations. In the strong-field regime, the high harmonic spectrum is sensitively controlled by light-driven quantum interferences between the interband valley resonances and intraband currents originating from electrons occupying various points in the Brillouin zone, also away from K/K' valleys such as $\Gamma$ and M. Our experimental observations are in strong agreement with quantum simulations, validating their interpretation. This work proposes new routes for harnessing laser-driven quantum interference in two-dimensional hexagonal systems and all-optical techniques to occupy and read-out electronic structures in the full Brillouin zone via strong-field nonlinear optics, advancing quantum technologies.</p>

Moreover, the efficiency of the up-conversion to a higher frequency is much larger than that of the down conversion to a lower frequency. These experimental results are reproduced well via numerical calculation, verifying that the significant up-conversion efficiency is traced back to nonlinear magnetization dynamics in the metamaterials.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin A. Kopp, Sabine H. L. Klapp</p>
            <p>Using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics we study heat production related to the stochastic motion of a particle driven by repulsive, nonlinear, time-delayed feedback. Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback can lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical Review E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by analytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around the threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production rate, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the nonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime, we compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system and a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the threshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as function of the delay time. In this regime, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ can be approximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the long-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated heat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.</p>

            <p>Current-induced spin magnetization (CISM) specific to chiral crystals is microscopically analyzed using multipole theory to identify the necessary hopping and spin-orbit couplings (SOCs). Tight-binding models capturing the essence of chiral crystals are introduced to investigate the multipole degrees of freedom possessed by the Hamiltonian. The results reveal that chiral SOC has a multipole degree of freedom specific to chiral crystals. Subsequently, the CISM is evaluated numerically and analytically. The results show that in addition to the chiral SOC, hopping along the $z$-axis, which is irrelevant from a multipole perspective, is crucial for CISM. This hopping is required to break the combined symmetry of wavevector translation and spin flipping, which we refer to as spin glide symmetry. This confirms that hopping irrelevant to chirality can play a crucial role in physical properties arising from chirality without contradicting the framework of multipole theory.</p>

            <p>In this first-principles study, we investigated the thermoelectric properties of the full-Heusler compound CsK$_2$Sb at different compressive strains. This material exhibits a valence band structure with significant effective mass anisotropy, forming tube-like energy isosurfaces below the band edge, akin to that of two-dimensional (2D) systems. Such systems can have a large number of high-mobility charge carriers and a beneficial density of states profile. In the calculations, we predicted a maximum p-type figure of merit ($zT$) of 2.6 at 800 K, in line with previous predictions of high $zT$. This high $zT$ arises from the low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.35 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ and the beneficial electronic band structure. The high density of states significantly increased the electron-scattering space, but this effect was largely compensated by reduced scattering rates of electrons with large momentum ${\mathbf{q}}$. We further explored the effect of enhancing the low-dimensionality through compressive strain. This increased the p-type power factor by up to 66 %; partly due to more strongly pronounced 2D features of the valence band, but primarily due to increased Fermi velocities. However, compressive strain also increased phonon velocities and hence the lattice thermal conductivity. The maximum p-type $zT$ thus only increased slightly, to 2.7 at 1 % compressive strain. In the conduction band, strain aligned the $\Gamma$- and X-centered valleys, resulting in the optimal n-type $zT$ increasing from 0.9 to 2.3 at 2 % compressive strain. Thus, highly strained CsK$_2$Sb has the potential for both good p- and n-type thermoelectricity.</p>

By varying the polarization directions of the pump light relative to the in-plane crystalline axes, the valley polarization of electrons and the momentum asymmetry of holes are separately probed through observing the polarization rotation of THz pulses. We demonstrate that the valley relaxation time of electrons near the conduction band minimum exceeds 1.5 ps at room temperature, in good agreement with theoretically calculated intervalley phonon scattering with f process.

            <h2>Quantum Electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels in a deep-subwavelength hyperbolic phonon polariton cavity</h2>

            <p>The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</p>

            <h2>Observation of transverse Thomson effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atsushi Takahagi, Takamasa Hirai, Abdulkareem Alasli, Sang Jun Park, Hosei Nagano, Ken-ichi Uchida</p>
            <p>The thermoelectric Thomson effect, predicted in the 1850s by William Thomson, produces volumetric heating/cooling in a conductor due to the concerted action of the Seebeck and Peltier effects. Recently, transverse thermoelectrics studies on the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects have progressed rapidly to enable versatile thermal management technologies and to explore topological transport properties. However, a transverse Thomson effect, arising from the concerted action of the Nernst and Ettingshausen effects, has not yet been observed. Here, we report the observation of the transverse Thomson effect in a conductor. We observed volumetric heating/cooling in a semimetallic Bi$_{88}$Sb$_{12}$ alloy induced by a charge current, temperature gradient, and magnetic field applied orthogonally to each other using thermoelectric imaging techniques. We found that the heating/cooling can be switched by the field direction. Our experiments and analyses reveal the essential difference between the conventional and transverse Thomson effects; the former depends sorely on the temperature derivative of the Seebeck coefficient, while the latter depends not only on the temperature derivative of the Nernst coefficient but also on its magnitude. The observation of the transverse Thomson effect fills a missing piece in the history of thermoelectrics and provides a new principle for active thermal management technologies.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present a theoretical and computational investigations of the atomic scale structure of the heterointerface formed between the (001) surface of $L1_0$-ordered iron palladium (FePd) alloy and graphene (Gr), namely, $L1_0$-FePd(001)/Gr. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the topmost surface layer consisting of Pd (Pd-terminated surface) becomes more energetically stable than Fe, and Pd-terminated surfaces are not conducive to Gr adsorption. On the other hand, under oxygen atmosphere conditions, our calculation suggests the presence of Fe-terminated surfaces with Gr-covered structures reproducing recent experimental observations. Moreover, the finding of Fe--O bonds formed by oxidizated surface is also consistent with those of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings are crucial for understanding the fabrication processes of interfaces in Fe-based $L1_0$ alloy materials.</p>

            <h2>Incompatible observables in classical physics: A closer look at measurement in Hamiltonian mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Theurel</p>
            <p>Quantum theory famously entails the existence of incompatible measurements; pairs of observables which cannot be simultaneously measured to arbitrary precision. Incompatibility is widely regarded to be a uniquely quantum phenomenon, linked to failure to commute of quantum operators. Even in the face of deep parallels between quantum commutators and classical Poisson brackets, no connection has been established between the Poisson algebra and any intrinsic limitations to classical measurement. Here I examine measurement in classical Hamiltonian physics as a process involving the joint evolution of an object-system and a finite-temperature measuring apparatus. Instead of the ideal measurement capable of extracting information without disturbing the system, I find a Heisenberg-like precision-disturbance relation: Measuring an observable leaves all Poisson-commuting observables undisturbed but inevitably disturbs all non-Poisson-commuting observables. In this relation the role of h-bar is played by an apparatus-specific quantity, q-bar. While not a universal constant, q-bar takes a finite positive value for any apparatus that can be built. I show that a classical version of Ozawa's model of quantum measurement, originally proposed as a means to violate the Heisenberg relation, does not violate the classical relation. Hence, incompatibility may prove to be a feature not only of quantum, but of classical physics too. This approach points the way to studying the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics, which was until now assumed to be trivial. It now seems possible that it is non-trivial and bears a resemblance to the quantum formalism. These findings may be of interest to researchers working on foundations of quantum mechanics, particularly for psi-epistemic interpretations. And there may be applications in the fields of precision measurement, nanoengineering and molecular machines.</p>

            <h2>Dicke superradiant enhancement of the heat current in circuit QED</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gian Marcello Andolina, Paolo Andrea Erdman, Frank Noé, Jukka Pekola, Marco Schirò</p>
            <p>Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.</p>

            <h2>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Zhang, Jing-Yuan Chen</p>
            <p>Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by Lüscher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</p>

            <p>Designing the amplitude and range of couplings in quantum systems is a fundamental tool for exploring a large variety of quantum mechanical effects. Here, we consider off-resonant photon scattering processes on a geometrically shaped molecular cloud. Our analysis shows that such a setup is properly modeled by a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian where the range, amplitude and sign of the tunneling processes of the scattered photonic modes can be accurately tuned. Specifically, by varying the molecular distribution, we demonstrate that different configurations characterized by geometrical frustration, long-range power law hopping processes, and non-local gauge fields can be achieved. Our results thus represent a powerful and alternative approach to perform an accurate Hamiltonian engineering of quantum systems with non trivial coupling structures.</p>

            <h2>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romuald A. Janik</p>
            <p>We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Ingham, Ronny Thomale, Harley D. Scammell</p>
            <p>Alongside high-temperature charge order and superconductivity, kagome metals exhibit signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking and nematicity which appear to depend strongly on external perturbations such as strain and magnetic fields, posing a fundamental challenge for conceptual reconciliation. We develop a theory of vestigial order descending from an excitonic mother state in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K,Rb,Cs), which develops around $T_* \approx 40$ K. The application of external fields stabilises a subset of the phase-melted order parameter manifold, referred to as a vestigial state, producing a symmetry-breaking response which depends on the applied probe. Our theory reproduces the observations of piezomagnetism, electric magnetic chiral anisotropy, absence of Kerr rotation, unusual elastoresistance response, and superconducting diode effect. Our proposed excitonic mother state accounts for probe-dependent symmetry breaking patterns without fine-tuning, and predicts additional signatures accessible through optical spectroscopy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ursula Wurstbauer, Michael J. Manfra, Ken W. West, Loren N. Pfeiffer</p>
            <p>Ultra-clean low-dimensional interacting charge carrier systems are the basis to explore correlated states and phases. We report the observation of very narrow collective intersubband excitations (ISBE) of 2D electron systems (2DESs) with ultra-high mobilities in high quality GaAs quantum well structures. These findings from resonant inelastic light scattering (RILS) experiments are used as tools for exploration of links between transport mobility and collective electron behavior in 2DES of high perfection. We find that the linewidths of collective ISBE modes can be very narrow with values smaller than 80{\mu}eV. Comparison of ISBE measurements from several high-mobility samples exhibits a variation in linewidth of more than a factor of two. There is, however, a surprising lack of direct correlation between ISBE linewidth with mobility in the range 15x10^6 cm^2/Vs<{\mu}<24x10^6 cm^2/Vs. ISBE by RILS are discussed as a sensitive probe to characterize the interacting electron systems for fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) studies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometric Engineering of Dual Hall Effects in 2D Antiferromagnetic Bilayers via Interlayer Magnetic Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenning Sun, Tao Wang, Hao Jin, Xinru Li, Yadong Wei, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>The interplay between quantum geometry and magnetic order offers a novel strategy for designing next-generation nanodevices. Here, we demonstrate that interlayer magnetic coupling in two-dimensional (2D) CoPSe3 bilayers enables precise control over quantum geometric mechanisms, unlocking dual intrinsic Hall effects. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the altermagnetic (AM) phase exhibits a giant anisotropic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) ($\sigma_{xy}$ is approximately 46 S/cm) driven by Berry curvature localized at generic k-points, while the PT-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase hosts an intrinsic second-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE) ($\chi_{xyy}$ is approximately 160 ${\mu}$S/V) originating from quantum metric accumulation at high-symmetry k-points. By tuning interlayer magnetic couplings, we achieve reversible switching between these phases, leveraging their distinct band structures and symmetry constraints. The Neel-vector-dependent AHE in the AM phase and the symmetry-protected NAHE in the AFM phase highlight quantum geometry as a versatile tool for manipulating transport properties. Our work establishes 2D antiferromagnets as a promising platform for multifunctional device architectures, bridging linear and nonlinear magnetoelectric responses through tailored quantum geometric engineering.</p>

            <p>The valley Hall effect (VHE) holds great promise for valleytronic applications by leveraging the valley degree of freedom. To date, research on VHE has focused on its linear response to an applied current, leaving nonlinear valley responses undetected and nonlinear valleytronic devices undeveloped. Here, we report the experimental observation of a nonlinear VHE in a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, evidenced by the generation of second-harmonic nonlocal voltages under AC currents. Remarkably, the nonlinear VHE has magnitude surpassing the linear VHE and is highly tunable via a gate voltage, which exhibits a pair of opposite peaks on the two sides of a Dirac gap. The nonlinear signal shows quadratic scaling with driving current and quartic scaling with local resistance, setting it apart from the linear counterpart. These experimental features are consistent with the theoretical picture of nonlocal transport mediated by nonlinear VHE and linear inverse VHE. We further reveal a nonlinear inverse VHE by observing the third- and fourth-harmonic nonlocal voltages. The nonlinear VHE provides a novel mechanism for valley manipulation and enables a novel valleytronic device, the valley rectifier, that converts AC charge current into DC valley current.</p>

A subgroup in this series, like MnSb4Te7 and GeSb4Te7, can be driven to a superconducting state by applying a physical pressure, making them viable candidates to realize so-called topological superconductivity. However, the role of magnetic fluctuations in this pressure-induced superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we report the pressure-induced multiple superconducting phases in the nonmagnetic GeBi4Te7, accompanied by corresponding structural transitions evidenced from the high-pressure Raman scattering. In comparison with other members in this family, we find the superconducting transition temperature of the nonmagnetic subgroup is significantly higher than their magnetic homologues, possibly hinting at the detrimental role played by the magnetic fluctuations in the superconductivity formation, at least in this pseudo-binary chalcogenide family.</p>

            <p>The nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), as an efficient and green pathway for ammonia synthesis, plays a crucial role in achieving on-demand ammonia production. This study proposes a novel design concept based on dual-iron atomic sites and nitrogen-boron co-doped graphene catalysts, exploring their high efficiency in NRR. By modulating the N and B co-doped ratios, we found that Fe2N3B@G catalyst exhibited significant activity in the adsorption and hydrogenation of N2 molecules, especially with the lowest free energy (0.32 eV) on NRR distal pathway, showing its excellent nitrogen activation capability and NRR performance. The computed electron localization function, crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, electrostatic potential map revealed that the improved NRR kinetics of Fe2N3B@G catalyst derived by N3B co-doping induced optimization of Fe-Fe electronic environment, regulation of Fe-N bond strength, and the continuous electronic support during the N2 breakage and hydrogenation. In particular, machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations were employed to verify the high activity of Fe2N3B@G catalyst in NRR, which reveal that Fe2N3B@G effectively regulates the electron density of Fe-N bond, ensuring the smooth generation and desorption of NH3 molecules and avoiding the competition with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, the determined higher HER overpotential of Fe2N3B@G catalyst can effectively inhibit the HER and enhance the selectivity toward NRR. In addition, Fe2N3B@G catalyst also showed good thermal stability by MD simulations up to 500 K, offering its feasibility in practical applications. This study demonstrates the superior performance of Fe2N3B@G in nitrogen reduction catalysis, and provides theoretical guidance for atomic catalyst design by the co-doping strategy and in-deep electronic environment modulation.</p>

            <p>Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. By exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new neutral quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. Pushing the light-matter interaction to ultra-strong coupling regimes we find other two important effects, a cavity vacuum-induced Stark shift for charged quasi-particles and a potential instability towards a density modulated stripe phase, competing against the phase separation driven by the Stark shift. Finally, we discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals magnets hosting topological magnetic textures, such as skyrmions, show promise for applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Electrical control of these topological spin textures would enable novel devices with enhanced performance and functionality. Here, using electron microscopy combined with in situ electric and magnetic biasing, we show that the skyrmion chirality, whether left-handed or right-handed, in insulating Cr2Ge2Te6, is controlled by external electric field direction applied during magnetic field cooling process. The electric-field-tuned chirality remains stable, even amid variations in magnetic and electric fields. Our theoretical investigation reveals that nonzero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between the nearest neighbors, induced by the external electric field, change their sign upon reversing the electric field direction, thereby facilitating chirality selection. The electrical control of magnetic chirality demonstrated in this study can be extended to other non-metallic centrosymmetric skyrmion-hosting magnets, opening avenues for future device designs in topological spintronics and quantum computing.</p>

            <p>The usual starting point for understanding magnons in cuprate antiferromagnets such as La$_2$CuO$_4$ is a spin model incorporating cyclic exchange, which descends from a one-band Hubbard model, and has parameters taken from fits based on non-interacting spin wave theory. Here we explore whether this provides a reliable description of experiment, using matrix product states (MPS) to calculate magnon spectra beyond spin wave theory. We find that analysis based on low orders of spin wave theory leads to systematic overestimates of exchange parameters, with corresponding errors in estimates of Hubbard $t/U$. Once these are corrected, the ''standard'' model provides a good account of magnon dispersion and lineshape in La$_2$CuO$_4$, but fails to fully capture the continuum observed at high energies. The extension of this analysis to CaCuO$_2$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is also discussed.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the transport and shot noise properties of a one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire with Rashba spin-orbit coupling~(SOC) placed in closed proximity to a bulk $s$-wave superconductor and an altermagnet with $d$-wave symmetry. Such heterostructure with vanishing net magnetization manifests itself as an alternative route to anchor Majorana zero modes~(MZMs) characterized by appropriate topological index~(winding number $W$). Interestingly, this system also hosts accidental zero modes~(AZMs) emerged with vanishing topological index indicating their non-topological nature. Furthermore, by incorporating three terminal setup, we explore the transport and shot noise signatures of these zero modes. At zero temperature, we obtain zero bias peak (ZBP) in differential conductance to be quantized with value $|W|\times 2 e^{2}/h$ for MZMs. On the other hand, AZMs exhibit non-quantized value at zero bias. Moreover, zero temperature shot noise manifests negative~(positive) value for MZMs~(AZMs) within the bulk gap. At finite temperature, shot noise exhibits negative value~(negative to positive transition) concerning MZMs~(AZMs). Thus, the obtained signatures clearly distinguish between the MZMs and non-topological AZMs. We extend our analysis by switching on the next to nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and SOC. Our conclusion remains unaffected for this case as well. Hence, our work paves the way to differentiate between emergent MZMs and AZMs in a semiconductor/ superconductor/ altermagnet heterostructure.</p>

            <p>CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a recently found two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet without showing magnetic order. We grew high-quality CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals and studied the low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and thermal conductivity. The dc magnetic susceptibility and magnetization reveal its nature of effective spin-1/2, easy axis anisotropy, and antiferromagnetic spin coupling. The ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility and specific heat data indicate the absence of any phase transition down to 20 mK. The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) at zero magnetic field exhibits a non-zero residual term $\kappa_0/T =$ 0.0056 W/K$^2$m. Although the magnetic field dependence of $\kappa$ is rather weak, the 14 T thermal conductivity shows an essential zero residual term.

The band structure resulting from light-dressing can exhibit starkly different quantum and topological phenomena. So far, optical control of charge within a light-dressed band structure has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate optical control of electrons in light-dressed graphene. By focusing circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses at 1550 nm on monolayer graphene, we generate a Floquet topological insulator (FTI). With a phase-locked second harmonic field, we dynamically control electrons in this FTI state. For the first time, we observe photocurrent circular dichroism, the all-optical anomalous Hall effect, and FTI valley-polarized currents. The photocurrents show strong sub-cycle phase-sensitivity, opening the door to ultrafast control within topologically protected electronics (topotronics), spectroscopy, and attosecond physics in novel quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Counterdiabatic Driving with Performance Guarantees</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jernej Rudi Finžgar, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin, Dries Sels</p>
            <p>Counterdiabatic (CD) driving has the potential to speed up adiabatic quantum state preparation by suppressing unwanted excitations. However, existing approaches either require intractable classical computations or are based on approximations which do not have performance guarantees. We propose and analyze a non-variational, system-agnostic CD expansion method and analytically show that it converges exponentially quickly in the expansion order. In finite systems, the required resources scale inversely with the spectral gap, which we argue is asymptotically optimal. To extend our method to the thermodynamic limit and suppress errors stemming from high-frequency transitions, we leverage finite-time adiabatic protocols. In particular, we show that a time determined by the quantum speed limit is sufficient to prepare the desired ground state, without the need to optimize the adiabatic trajectory. Numerical tests of our method on the quantum Ising chain show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art variational CD approaches.</p>

            <h2>A General Neural Network Potential for Energetic Materials with C, H, N, and O elements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingjie Wen, Jiahe Han, Wenjuan Li, Xiaoya Chang, Qingzhao Chu, Dongping Chen</p>
            <p>The discovery and optimization of high-energy materials (HEMs) are constrained by the prohibitive computational expense and prolonged development cycles inherent in conventional approaches. In this work, we develop a general neural network potential (NNP) that efficiently predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs composed of C, H, N, and O. Our framework leverages pre-trained NNP models, fine-tuned using transfer learning on energy and force data derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This strategy enables rapid adaptation across 20 different HEM systems while maintaining DFT-level accuracy, significantly reducing computational costs. A key aspect of this work is the ability of NNP model to capture the chemical activity space of HEMs, accurately describe the key atomic interactions and reaction mechanisms during thermal decomposition. The general NNP model has been applied in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and validated with experimental data for various HEM structures. Results show that the NNP model accurately predicts the structural, mechanical, and decomposition properties of HEMs by effectively describing their chemical activity space. Compared to traditional force fields, it offers superior DFT-level accuracy and generalization across both microscopic and macroscopic properties, reducing the computational and experimental costs. This work provides an efficient strategy for the design and development of HEMs and proposes a promising framework for integrating DFT, machine learning, and experimental methods in materials research.

            <p>Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behaviour of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200ns for such a qubit. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Non-Equilibrium Magic and Minimum Twist Angles in AA-Stacked Twisted Multilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yantao Li, Wang-Kong Tse</p>
            <p>We report the discovery of a series of non-equilibrium magic angles at which isolated topological flat quasienergy bands form in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene under circularly polarized light. These non-equilibrium magic angles can be traced back to specific static twist angles where the bandwidth reaches a minimum \textit{without} the formation of isolated flat bands. We refer to these as minimum twist angles, in contrast to the magic angles observed in twisted bilayer graphene. We show that an applied displacement field can further flatten the optically induced topological flat bands accompanied by larger non-equilibrium magic angles. The discovery of these electrically tunable topological flat quasienergy bands is expected to open up a new avenue of exploring exotic Floquet-driven phenomena in AA-stacked twisted multilayer graphene.</p>

            <p>Spin-triplet superconductivity is a key platform for topological quantum computing, yet its experimental realization and control in solid-state materials remain a significant challenge. For this purpose, we propose an ultrafast optical strategy to manipulate spin-triplet superconductivity by leveraging $p$-wave pairing instabilities in the extended Hubbard model, a framework applicable to transition-metal oxides. Utilizing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that transient flipping of the effective spin-exchange interaction can enhance $p$-wave pairing correlations under linearly polarized optical pulses. Furthermore, we reveal that this emergent spin-triplet pairing in strongly correlated systems can be selectively switched by an orthogonal optical pulse. This work provides a new pathway for stabilizing and controlling spin-triplet superconductivity in correlated materials.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-Induced Crossover of Quantum Jump Statistics in Postselection-Free Many-Body Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Ryusuke Hamazaki</p>
            <p>We reveal a nontrivial crossover of subsystem fluctuations of quantum jumps in continuously monitored many-body systems, which have a trivial maximally mixed state as a steady-state density matrix. While the fluctuations exhibit the standard volume law $\propto L$ following Poissonian statistics for sufficiently weak measurement strength, anomalous yet universal scaling law $\propto L^\alpha \:(\alpha\sim 2.7)$ indicating super-Poissonian statistics appears for strong measurement strength. This drastically affects the precision of estimating the rate of quantum jumps: for strong (weak) measurement, the estimation uncertainty is enhanced (suppressed) as the system size increases. We demonstrate that the anomalous scaling of the subsystem fluctuation originates from an integrated many-body autocorrelation function and that the transient dynamics contributes to the scaling law rather than the Liouvillian gap. The measurement-induced crossover is accessed only from the postselection-free information obtained from the time and the position of quantum jumps and can be tested in ultracold atom experiments.</p>

First, we find multiple sign changes of the induced bulk dc photocurrent as a function of light parameters, which is ascribed to the nature of asymmetric photon-dressed bands in chiral systems. Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that directly confirms the theoretical predictions. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Phases for Finite-Temperature Gases of Bosonic Polar Molecules Shielded by Dual Microwaves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Zhang, Kun Chen, Su Yi, Tao Shi</p>
            <p>We investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of polar molecules shielded by dual microwave fields using the path integral Monte Carlo method combined with the worm algorithm. We determine the critical temperature $T_c$ for Bose-Einstein condensations (BECs) and identify two distinct phases below $T_c$: the expanding gas (EG) phase and the self-bound gas (SBG) phase. We further analyze the temperature and interaction-strength dependence of the condensate and superfluid fractions. Notably, in contrast to dilute atomic BECs, the SBG phase displays a low condensate fraction and a high superfluid fraction, resembling the behavior of strongly correlated $^4$He superfluids. These significant many-body correlations arise from the interplay between long-range dipole-dipole interactions and the short-range shielding potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the aspect ratio of the gas provides a characteristic geometric signature to accurately determine the EG-to-SBG transition, robust against external trapping potentials. Our findings provide unbiased and numerically exact results to guide upcoming experiments with polar molecules.</p>

            <p>Exciton-polaritons in III-V semiconductor microcavities offer a robust platform for emulating complex Hamiltonians, enabling advancements in photonic applications and quantum simulation. Here, two novel fabrication techniques designed to overcome the limitations of traditional photonic confinement methods are introduced. The two distinct approaches - etch-and-oversputter (EnS) and deposit-and-oversputter (DnS) - are both based on a structured, locally elongated semiconductor cavity, leading to a deep and highly controllable spatially dependent potential. By utilizing an all-dielectric sputtered top mirror, sample iteration time, workflow complexity and expense is reduced while increasing the overall yield compared to methods such as deep ion etching. Employing a Kagome lattice and its flatband and Dirac-cone dispersions as a benchmark, high quality optical band structures are achieved, which so far have not been realized using a deep etching approach. To highlight the precise control over the lattice couplings, the eigenmodes in a two-dimensional breathing Kagome lattice are studied and polariton lasing from a zerodimensional corner mode is observed. This confirms the effectiveness of the methods presented in this paper for generating well-controlled, deep and homogeneous trapping potentials. These pave the way for fabricating intricate lattices, such as higher-order topological insulators, or on-chip quantum emitters utilizing the polariton blockade mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs from two interacting quantum emitters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrián Juan-Delgado, Geza Giedke, Javier Aizpurua, Ruben Esteban</p>
            <p>Entangled photon pairs are key elements in quantum communication and quantum cryptography. State-of-the-art sources of entangled photons are mainly based on parametric-down conversion from nonlinear crystals, which is probabilistic in nature, and on cascade emission from biexciton quantum dots, which finds difficulties in generating entangled photons in the visible regime. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that polarization-entangled photon pairs can be emitted from two interacting quantum emitters with two-level-system behaviour and perpendicular transition dipole moments. These emitters can represent a large variety of systems (e.g., organic molecules, quantum dots and diamond-color centers) offering a large technological versatility, for example in the spectral regime of the emission. We show that a highly entangled photon pair can be post-selected from this system by including optical filters. Additionally, we verify that the photon entanglement is not significantly affected by small changes in the detection directions and in the orientation between the dipole moments.</p>

            <h2>Spin-split flat bands at the band edge and two-dimensional hole gases towards quantum Hall effect in altermagnetic CoF$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Wen Yu, Bang-Gui Liu</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic phase is recently found as a new magnetic phase in addition to the conventional collinear spin orders, and great efforts have been made to explore novel effects and potential applications in such materials. Here, we show that there are robust altermagnetic spin-split flat bands near the valence band edge in rutile CoF$_2$ through first-principles investigation. It is uncovered that the magnetic moments can remain in the z axis because of the magnetocrystalline energy due to the spin-orbits coupling and the spin orientation can be made more stable by magnetic field applied in the xy plane. We describe the spin-dependent band structure (including the flat bands) near the Fermi level by a spin-resolved effective low-energy model, and reveal that they can host spin-dependent two-dimensional hole gases. Importantly, we find spin-dependent quantum Hall effects in the two-dimensional hole gases by applying the magnetic field in the xy plane, and then explore the dependence of Hall conductivity and Hall resistance on the Fermi level and the magnetic field (both magnitude and direction) and related longitudinal carrier transport properties.</p>

            <p>Thin-films of bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) were measured to have an enhanced atomic magnetic moment of $2.52 \pm 0.07$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ beyond the pinnacle of the Slater-Pauling curve for Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$ with a moment of $2.42$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$. The compositional variation of the average total moment for thin-film bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ alloys is in stark contrast to the historical measurements of bulk fcc Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$. These GGA calculations reveal that significant improvements of this ferromagnetic forced bct phase on MgO(001) are possible via substrate selection. For example, bct Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$ films on MgO(001) are calculated to have lower atomic moments than those on substrates with smaller lattice constants such as GaAs(001), BaTiO$_3$(110), and SrTiO$_3$(110) which is predicted to increase the average atomic moment up to $2.61$ $\mu_\text{B}/\text{atom}$ and lead to increased structural stability and therefore thicker film growths.</p>

            <p>Magnetic heat capacity measurements of a high-quality single crystal of the dipole-octupole pyrochlore Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ down to a temperature of $T = 0.02$ K are reported. These show a two-peaked structure, with a Schottky-like peak at $T_1 \sim 0.065$ K, similar to what is observed in its sister Ce-pyrochlores Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. However a second, sharper peak is observed at $T_2 \sim 0.025$ K, which signifies the entrance to its ground state, as even the most abrupt low-temperature extrapolation to $C_P=0$ at $T = 0$ K gives a full accounting of $R\ln(2)$ in entropy, associated with the well isolated pseudospin-1/2 doublet for Ce$^{3+}$ in this environment. The ground state could be conventionally ordered, although theory predicts a much larger anomaly in $C_P$, at much higher temperatures than the measured $T_2$, for expectations from an all-in all-out ground state of the nearest-neighbor XYZ Hamiltonian for Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. The sharp low-temperature peak could also signify a cross-over from a classical spin liquid to a quantum spin liquid (QSL). The diffuse magnetic neutron scattering observed from Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures between $T_2$ and $T_1$ resembles that observed from Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, which is well established as a $\pi$-flux quantum spin ice (QSI).</p>

            <p>Electrical control of quantum magnetic states is essential in spintronic science. Initial studies on the ferromagnetic state control were extended to collinear antiferromagnets and, more recently, noncollinear antiferromagnets. However, electrical control mechanisms of such exotic magnetic states remain poorly understood. Here, we report the first experimental and theoretical example of the current control of helical antiferromagnets, arising from the competition between collinear antiferromagnetic exchange and interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in new van-der-Waals (vdW) material Ni1/3NbS2. Due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry, an in-plane current generates spin-orbit torque that, in turn, interacts directly with the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our theoretical analyses indicate that a weak ferromagnetic order coexists due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, mediating the spin-orbit torque to collectively rotate the helical antiferromagnetic order. Our Ni1/3NbS2 nanodevice experiments produce current-dependent resistance change consistent with the theoretical prediction. This work widens our understanding of the electrical control of helical antiferromagnets and promotes vdW quantum magnets as interesting material platforms for electrical control.</p>

            <p>Dimensionality engineering in A$_{n+1}$B$_n$X$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite phases has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance optoelectronic properties. These properties are highly material-dependent, requiring detailed exploration of electronic, optical, excitonic, transport, and polaronic characteristics. However, the absence of comprehensive studies continues to impede the rational design of high-performance materials. In this work, we investigate the excitonic and polaronic effects in A$_{n+1}$Hf$_n$S$_{3n+1}$ (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba; n = 1-3) RP phases, examining their relative stability and optoelectronic properties using several first-principles based methodologies within the framework of density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE). Our study suggests that these compounds are mechanically stable and feature G$_0$W$_0$@PBE bandgaps ranging from 1.43 to 2.14 eV, which are smaller than those of their bulk counterparts. BSE and model-BSE (mBSE) calculations indicate that these RP phases display notable optical anisotropy, with the exciton binding energy decreasing as the thickness of the perovskite layer increases. In addition, intermediate to strong carrier-phonon scattering is observed in these compounds, confirmed through the Fröhlich mechanism near room temperature. Using the Feynman polaron model, the polaron parameters of these RP phases are also computed, and it is found that charge-separated polaronic states are less stable than bound excitons. Finally, a significant increase in electron mobilities is observed in RP phases compared to their bulk counterparts. Overall, the insights gained from this study will enable the rational design of layered perovskite phases for applications in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>We consider a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) inside an optical cavity and two crossed coherent pump fields. We determine the phase boundary separating the normal superfluid phase and the superradiance phase, perturbatively. In the regime of negative cavity detuning, we map out the phase diagrams both for an attractive and a repulsive optical lattice. It turns out that the situation is quite different in two cases. Specifically, in the case of attractive lattice, if a system is in the superradiant phase with one pump laser, adding another pump does not drive the system out of the superradiance phase. While for the repulsive lattice, increasing another pump potential have suppressive effects on the superradiance. We also find that, in the case of attractive lattice, equally increasing two pump lattice potentials can induce a transition from the normal phase to the superradiance phase. In stark contrast, for the repulsive lattice, the system will remain in the normal phase as the pump depths are tuned within a wide range, independent of the cavity detuning and the decay rate.</p>

            <p>Photonic technologies continue to drive the quest for new optical materials with unprecedented responses. A major frontier in this field is the exploration of nonlocal (spatially dispersive) materials, going beyond the local, wavevector-independent assumption traditionally made in optical material modeling. On one end, the growing interest in plasmonic, polaritonic and quantum materials has revealed naturally occurring nonlocalities, emphasizing the need for more accurate models to predict and design their optical responses. This has major implications also for topological, nonreciprocal, and time-varying systems based on these material platforms. Beyond natural materials, artificially structured materials--metamaterials and metasurfaces--can provide even stronger and engineered nonlocal effects, emerging from long-range interactions or multipolar effects. This is a rapidly expanding area in the field of photonic metamaterials, with open frontiers yet to be explored. In the case of metasurfaces, in particular, nonlocality engineering has become a powerful tool for designing strongly wavevector-dependent responses, enabling enhanced wavefront control, spatial compression, multifunctional devices, and wave-based computing. Furthermore, nonlocality and related concepts play a critical role in defining the ultimate limits of what is possible in optics, photonics, and wave physics. This Roadmap aims to survey the most exciting developments in nonlocal photonic materials, highlight new opportunities and open challenges, and chart new pathways that will drive this emerging field forward--toward new scientific discoveries and technological advancements.</p>

            <h2>Topological phenomena in artificial quantum materials revealed by local Chern markers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin D. Spataru, Wei Pan, Alexander Cerjan</p>
            <p>A striking example of frustration in physics is Hofstadter's butterfly, a fractal structure that emerges from the competition between a crystal's lattice periodicity and the magnetic length of an applied field. Current methods for predicting the topological invariants associated with Hofstadter's butterfly are challenging or impossible to apply to a range of materials, including those that are disordered or lack a bulk spectral gap. Here, we demonstrate a framework for predicting a material's local Chern markers using its position-space description and validate it against experimental observations of quantum transport in artificial graphene in a semiconductor heterostructure, inherently accounting for fabrication disorder strong enough to close the bulk spectral gap. By resolving local changes in the system's topology, we reveal the topological origins of antidot-localized states that appear in artificial graphene in the presence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we show the breadth of this framework by simulating how Hofstadter's butterfly emerges from an initially unpatterned 2D electron gas as the system's potential strength is increased, and predict that artificial graphene becomes a topological insulator at the critical magnetic field. Overall, we anticipate that a position-space approach to determine a material's Chern invariant without requiring prior knowledge of its occupied states or bulk spectral gaps will enable a broad array of fundamental inquiries and provide a novel route to material discovery, especially in metallic, aperiodic, and disordered systems.</p>

            <p>In orbital Chern insulators, the chemical potential acts as a tuning knob to reverse chirality in dissipationless edge currents, enabling electric-field control of magnetic order-key for future quantum electronics. Despite the rise of orbital Chern insulators, electrically switchable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains rare, necessitating further investigation. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced reversal of orbital Chern insulators in a moire superlattice composed of rhombohedral heptalayer graphene (r-7LG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. At one electron per moire unit cell, two emerging Chern insulating phases - one pointing away from and the other toward graphene's charge neutrality point in the phase diagram of carrier density (n) versus magnetic field (B) - exhibit energetic competition modulated by both n and B. This switchable QAHE chirality in r-7LG demonstrates a layer-number dependent response: similar phenomena in moire r-6LG require much higher magnetic fields and are absent in thinner rhombohedral graphene. Our findings establish moire-engineered rhombohedral graphene as a promising platform for exploring topological quantum materials with electrically controllable chiral edge modes and magnetic order.</p>

            <p>The coexistence of topological bands around the Fermi level ($E_F$) and superconductivity provides a fundamental platform for exploring their interplay. However, few materials inherently display both properties. In this study, we demonstrate the coexistence of topological surface states at the $E_F$ and superconductivity in NiTe$_2$ single crystals, a material hitherto not recognized as superconducting. Quasiparticle interference measurements performed via scanning tunneling microscopy suggest the presence of topological surface states at the $E_F$, which is further corroborated by density functional theory simulations. Experimental evidence for superconductivity is provided via electronic transport measurements and specific heat capacity analyses. Our results suggest that NiTe$_2$ represents a promising platform for investigating the rich interplay between topological states and superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Statistical physics analysis of graph neural networks: Approaching optimality in the contextual stochastic block model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Duranthon, L. Zdeborová</p>
            <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to process data associated with graphs. They are finding an increasing range of applications; however, as with other modern machine learning techniques, their theoretical understanding is limited. GNNs can encounter difficulties in gathering information from nodes that are far apart by iterated aggregation steps. This situation is partly caused by so-called oversmoothing; and overcoming it is one of the practically motivated challenges. We consider the situation where information is aggregated by multiple steps of convolution, leading to graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We analyze the generalization performance of a basic GCN, trained for node classification on data generated by the contextual stochastic block model. We predict its asymptotic performance by deriving the free energy of the problem, using the replica method, in the high-dimensional limit. Calling depth the number of convolutional steps, we show the importance of going to large depth to approach the Bayes-optimality. We detail how the architecture of the GCN has to scale with the depth to avoid oversmoothing. The resulting large depth limit can be close to the Bayes-optimality and leads to a continuous GCN. Technically, we tackle this continuous limit via an approach that resembles dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) with constraints at the initial and final times. An expansion around large regularization allows us to solve the corresponding equations for the performance of the deep GCN. This promising tool may contribute to the analysis of further deep neural networks.</p>

            <h2>The emergent dynamics of double-folded randomly branching ring polymers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elham Ghobadpour, Max Kolb, Ivan Junier, Ralf Everaers</p>
            <p>The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.</p>

            <h2>Tail-induced equilibration in long-range interacting quantum lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei-Han Li</p>
            <p>We examine the relation between inter-particle interactions and real-time equilibration in one-dimensional lattice systems with hard-core constraints. Focusing on the roles of interactions, our results demonstrate that in the presence of interaction tails, any power-law exponent (including the limit ones) can encode the random particle configurations to the Hamiltonian, leaving the latter characterized by random matrices. Through an experimental-accessible setup using dipolar-interacting particles in optical lattices, the quenched relaxations are demonstrated resulting in equilibrium, and the relation between eigenstate thermalization is confirmed. Our study directly unveiled the role of inter-particle interactions in quantum many-body dynamics, offering a new scheme to address equilibration in closed quantum many-body problem based on the manifesting of random particle configurations in the model Hamiltonian.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical exponents as an emergent property at interacting topological quantum critical points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Fei Zhou</p>
            <p>In standard studies of quantum critical points (QCPs), the dynamical exponent $z$ is introduced as a fundamental parameter along with global symmetries to identify universality classes. Often, the dynamical exponent $z$ is set to be one as the most natural choice for quantum field theory representations, which further implies emergence of higher space-time symmetries near QCPs in many condensed matter systems. In this article, we study a family of topological quantum critical points (tQCPs) where the $z=1$ quantum field theory is prohibited in a fundamental representation by a protecting symmetry, resulting in tQCPs with $z=2$. We further illustrate that when strong interactions are properly taken into account, the stable weakly interacting gapless tQCPs with $z=2$ can further make a transition to another family of gapless tQCPs with dynamical exponent $z=1$, without breaking the protecting symmetry. Our studies suggest that dynamical exponents, as well as the degrees of freedom in fermion fields, can crucially depend on interactions in topological quantum phase transitions; in tQCPs, to a large extent, they are better thought of as emergent properties.</p>

            <p>Magnetic orders of non-Heisenberg Tsai-type 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) in the Au-Ga-Dy system were studied through bulk magnetization, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering techniques. The results uncovered noncoplanar, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin configurations whirling along [111] crystallographic axis, which is analogous to those observed in the Tb- and Ho-contained counterparts. The crystal electric field excitations similar to those in the Tb-based counterpart are also observed indicating the strong Ising-like magnetic anisotropy. These comprehensive experiments and analyses have revealed the existence of a universal mechanism that stabilizes noncoplanar FM and AFM structures in non-Heisenberg Tsai-type ACs, independent of the rare-earth species (Tb, Dy, Ho); FM intra-cluster interactions and strong Ising-like anisotropy.</p>

            <p>In this study, the role of elastic and interfacial energies in the shape evolution of T1 precipitates in Al-Cu-Li alloys is investigated using phase-field modeling. We employ a formulation considering the stoichiometric nature of the precipitate phase explicitly, including coupled equation systems for various order parameters. Inputs such as elastic properties are derived from DFT calculations, while chemical potentials are obtained from CALPHAD databases. This methodology provides a framework that is consistent with the derived chemical potentials to study the interplay of thermodynamic, kinetic, and elastic effects on T1 precipitate evolution in Al-Cu-Li alloys. It is shown that diffusion-controlled lengthening and interface-controlled thickening are important mechanisms to describe the growth of T1 precipitates. Furthermore, the study illustrates that the precipitate shape is significantly influenced by the anisotropy in interfacial energy and linear reaction rate, however, elastic effects only play a minor role.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Cluster Continuity and Dynamics in Time-Series Data: Application to Chromatin Polymer Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryo Nakanishi, Koji Hukushima</p>
            <p>This study presents an enhanced method for analyzing cluster dynamics, with a particular focus on tracking clusters' continuity over time using time-series data from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The proposed method was applied to spatio-temporal cluster data obtained from a non-equilibrium MD simulation of a chromatin polymer model. In this model, clusters are formed on the polymer by binding molecules that stochastically and temporarily bind to the polymer segments at finite rates. Our analysis successfully tracked the dynamics of clusters, including merging and splitting events, and revealed that clusters exhibit a percolation transition in both spatial and temporal domains. This suggests that clusters in the chromatin polymer model can persist even under finite rates of attractive interactions, demonstrating that the method can capture complex cluster dynamics over time.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ana Puente-Santamaria, Josselyn N. Molina-Basurto, Eva Gerardin, Francisco Ortega, Ramon G. Rubio, Eduardo Guzman</p>
            <p>This study explores the hydrogen bond-mediated association between chitosan (CHI) and alkyl polyglucoside (APG), a bio-based surfactant, in acidic conditions with varying ionic strengths. Unlike conventional polyelectrolyte-surfactant interactions that depend on electrostatic forces, the association in this system relies purely on non-ionic interactions. Using UV visible spectroscopy, phase diagrams, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), the bulk phase behavior and adsorption characteristics of CHI-APG mixtures on negatively charged surfaces was studied. Results demonstrate that APG concentration controls the phase behavior, with moderate levels inducing coacervate formation, while higher ionic strengths promote this coacervation through enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions. This shift leads to the formation of a phase separated morphology, with micronsized coacervate droplets observable in solution. Zeta potential measurements suggest that these droplets adopt a core shell structure, characterized by a hydrophobic core due to the surfactant s alkyl chains and a hydrophilic shell formed by chitosan. Additionally, the coacervation process significantly enhances the adsorption of CHI APG complexes onto solid substrates, a feature with potential applications in targeted delivery and controlled release systems. Overall, this study provides critical insights into the design of bio-based, sustainable formulations and expands the understanding of hydrogen bond-driven, nonelectrostatic coacervation, relevant for applications in cosmetics, biomedical coatings, and environmentally friendly materials.</p>

The results show a distinct pin hole mechanism for the material flow from terrace to terrace of the vicinal substrate surface. Nucleation and the formation of tin intercalated phase on terraces happen at steps. This results in a mesoscopic growth against the macroscopic diffusion direction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Viktoria Noel, Thomas Gasenzer, Kirill Boguslavski</p>
            <p>We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.</p>

            <h2>Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin D. Woods</p>
            <p>The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</p>

            <p>Lateral heterostructures built of monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are characterized by a thin 1D interface exhibiting a large energy offset. Recently, the formation of spatially separated charge-transfer (CT) excitons at the interface has been demonstrated. The technologically important exciton propagation across the interface and the impact of CT excitons has remained in the dark so far. In this work, we microscopically investigate the spatiotemporal exciton dynamics in the exemplary hBN-encapsulated WSe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ lateral heterostructure and reveal a highly interesting interplay of energy offset-driven unidirectional exciton drift across the interface and efficient capture into energetically lower CT excitons at the interface. This interplay triggers a counterintuitive thermal control of exciton transport with a less efficient propagation at lower temperatures - opposite to the behavior in conventional semiconductors. We predict clear signatures of this intriguing exciton propagation both in far- and near-field photoluminescence experiments. Our results present an important step toward a microscopic understanding of the technologically relevant unidirectional exciton transport in lateral heterostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Maitrier, Grégoire Loeper, Kiyoshi Kanazawa, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud</p>
            <p>Understanding the impact of trades on prices is a crucial question for both academic research and industry practice. It is well established that impact follows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the microscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are particularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed, there is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or whether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic theories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset provided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all orders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that such a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of single child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to "digest" them. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a "double" square-root effect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse square-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we expect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the impact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the issuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that price impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize the information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dip Joti Paul, Tony X. Zhou, Karl K. Berggren</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a technique to determine the mid-infrared refractive indices of thin superconducting films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In particular, we performed FTIR transmission and reflection measurements on 10-nm-thick NbN and 15-nm-thick MoSi films in the wavelength range of 2.5 to 25 $\mu$m, corresponding to frequencies of 12-120 THz or photon energies of 50-500 meV. To extract the mid-infrared refractive indices of the thin films from FTIR measurements, we used the Drude-Lorentz oscillator model to represent the dielectric functions of the films and implemented an optimization algorithm to fit these oscillator parameters, minimizing the error between the measured FTIR spectra and the simulated spectra calculated using the dielectric functions of the films. To evaluate the consistency of the extracted dielectric functions, we compared the refractive index values extrapolated from these dielectric functions in the UV to near-infrared wavelengths with the values separately measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry. For further validation, we calculated the sheet resistance of the films from their extracted Drude oscillator parameters and compared with the experimental values. This FTIR-based refractive index measurement approach can be extended to measure the refractive indices of thin films at wavelengths beyond 25 $\mu$m, which will be useful for designing highly efficient photon detectors and photonic devices with enhanced optical absorption in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.</p>

As a result, optimizing their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement.

Since soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using physical robots competing to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including several hundred percent increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-Kang Sun, Shu Chen</p>
            <p>We study quantum circuits with gates composed randomly of identity operators, projectors, or a kind of $R$ matrices which satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation and are unitary and dual-unitary. This enables us to translate the quantum circuit into a topological object with distinguished overcrossings and undercrossings. The circuit corresponds to a classical loop model when an overcrossings and undercrossing coincides. The entanglement entropy between the final state and initial state is given by the spanning number of the classical model, and they share the same phase diagram. Whenever an overcrossing and undercrossing differ, the circuit extends beyond the classical model. Considering a specific case with $R$ matrices randomly replaced by swap gates, we demonstrate that the topological effect dominates, and only the area-law phase remains in the thermodynamic limit, regardless of how small the replacement probability is. We also find evidence of an altered phase diagram for non-Clifford cases.</p>

Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small systems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that continue to perform well with increasing system size. This ensures that the ansatz captures robust features of the ground state structure. Remarkably, we find analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which encode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict ground state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We demonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently generated for both. The simple structure of the ansatz allows us to restore broken symmetries and obtain exact expressions for local observables and correlation functions. We also point out an interesting connection between this ansatz and a well-studied sequence in analytical number theory and the one-dimensional classical Ising model.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Lamb model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dennis P. Clougherty, Nam H. Dinh</p>
            <p>H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We show that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and we find that it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory for coupling strength below a critical value. The model is found to break down for coupling strength above the critical value where the lowest Bogoliubov frequency vanishes. We show that the addition of an anharmonic elastic term is sufficient to stabilize the system in this strong coupling regime.</p>

            <h2>Stress, Strain, or Displacement? A Novel Machine Learning Based Framework to Predict Mixed Mode I/II Fracture Toughness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amir Mohammad Mirzaei</p>
            <p>Accurate prediction of fracture toughness under complex loading conditions, like mixed mode I/II, is essential for reliable failure assessment. This paper aims to develop a machine learning framework for predicting fracture toughness and crack initiation angles by directly utilizing stress, strain, or displacement distributions represented by selected nodes as input features. Validation is conducted using experimental data across various mode mixities and specimen geometries for brittle materials. Among stress, strain, and displacement fields, it is shown that the stress-based features, when paired with Multilayer Perceptron models, achieve high predictive accuracy with R2 scores exceeding 0.86 for fracture load predictions and 0.94 for angle predictions. A comparison with the Theory of Critical Distances (Generalized Maximum Tangential Stress) demonstrates the high accuracy of the framework. Furthermore, the impact of input parameter selections is studied, and it is demonstrated that advanced feature selection algorithms enable the framework to handle different ranges and densities of the representing field. The framework's performance was further validated for datasets with a limited number of data points and restricted mode mixities, where it maintained high accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally efficient and practical, and it operates without any supplementary post-processing steps, such as stress intensity factor calculations.</p>

            <p>Life science research has largely benefited from the use of nanoparticles (NPs), yet fundamental issues such as colloidal stability and control over NP size and shape affect NP properties and functions in biomedical applications. Here we show that including capping agents directly into zinc oxide (ZnO) NP synthesis can lead to better control of these properties and their enhanced functionality. A systematic study of the influence capping agents has on the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of ZnO NP synthesized using the microwave (MW)-assisted polyol method is presented. Primary NP size (10-20 nm) was controlled by zinc precursor concentration, and NP shape was influenced by capping agent type. Capping agents enabled control over the surface charge and water interaction properties of ZnO for further investigations involving bacteria. The superior antibacterial effect was observed using positively charged, hydrophilic HMTA-capped ZnO, yet negatively charged hydrophobic OA-capped ZnO still exhibited an antibacterial effect. These observations suggest different underlying mechanisms, and we discuss these differences with particular reference to the specific surface area of ZnO, and how this is key to bacteria-nanoparticle interactions. Appropriate selection of capping agents is crucial for the synthesis of potent ZnO NPs intended for antibacterial applications, specifically for combating resistance.</p>

            <h2>Limit theorems and lack thereof for a multilayer random walk mimicking human mobility</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandra Bianchi, Marco Lenci, Françoise Pène</p>
            <p>We introduce a continuous-time random walk model on an infinite multilayer structure inspired by transportation networks. Each layer is a copy of $\mathbb{R}^d$, indexed by a non-negative integer. A walker moves within a layer by means of an inertial displacement whose speed is a deterministic function of the layer index and whose direction and duration are random, but with a timescale that depends on the layer. After each inertial displacement, the walker may randomly shift level, up or down, independently of its past. The multilayer structure is hierarchical, in the sense that the speed is a nondecreasing function of the layer index. Our primary focus is on the diffusive properties of the system. Under a natural condition on the parameters of the model, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the $\mathbb{R}^d$-coordinate of the process. By contrast, in a class of examples where this condition is violated, we are able to determine the correct scaling of the process while proving that no limit theorem holds.</p>

            <p>Complex gene regulatory networks often display emergent simple behavior. Sometimes this simplicity can be traced to a nearly equivalent energy landscape, but not always. Here we show how topological theory for stochastic and biochemical networks can predict phase transitions between dynamical regimes, where the simplest landscape paradigm fails. We demonstrate the utility of this topological approach for a simple gene network, revealing a new oscillatory regime in addition to previously recognized bistable and monostable phases. We show how local winding numbers predict the steady-state locations in the bistable and monostable phases, and a flux analysis predicts the respective strengths of steady-state peaks.</p>

            <p>Weyl semimetals can emerge from Dirac semimetals when the time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetries are broken. Recently, it has been proposed based on the Floquet theory that Dirac semimetals can be converted into Weyl semimetals even by shining circularly polarized light (CPL). Here we have investigated the possibility of such a Dirac-Weyl conversion by measuring the CPL-induced anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in a massive 3D Dirac semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ in the paramagnetic phase using ultrafast mid-infrared pump-terahertz Faraday rotation probe spectroscopy. We find that the field-strength and driving frequency dependence of the observed AHC is well accounted for by CPL-induced nonzero Berry curvature associated with the splitting of the Dirac bands as predicted by the Floquet theory. The estimated splitting of the Dirac bands reaches about 60 % of the mass gap and the calculated CPL-induced AHC quantitatively reproduces the experimental observation, demonstrating a promising route toward the realization of Floquet-Weyl states from massive Dirac semimetals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Schindler, Vir B. Bulchandani, Wladimir A. Benalcazar</p>
            <p>Nonlinear lattice models can support "discrete breather" excitations that stay localized in space for all time. By contrast, the localized Wannier states of linear lattice models are dynamically unstable. Nevertheless, symmetric and exponentially localized Wannier states are a central tool in the classification of band structures with crystalline symmetries. Moreover, the quantized transport observed in nonlinear Thouless pumps relies on the fact that -- at least in a specific model -- discrete breathers recover Wannier states in the limit of vanishing nonlinearity. Motivated by these observations, we investigate the correspondence between nonlinear breathers and exponentially localised Wannier states for a family of discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equations with crystalline symmetries. We develop a formalism to analytically predict the breathers' spectrum, center of mass and symmetry data, and apply this to nonlinear generalizations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain and the breathing kagome lattice.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>We conduct a comprehensive assessment of the electronic and optical properties, as well as photovoltaic (PV) performance parameters for Mg$_{2}$Si and Ca$_{2}$Si using density-functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) based methods. The band-gap for Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si) is found to be in the range of 0.25-0.6 (0.57-0.96) eV when PBE, PBEsol and mBJ functionals are used. In the independent-particle approximation (IPA), the real and imaginary parts of dielectric function show maximum values of 50 (16.3) at 2.6 (1.0) eV and 61 (16.2) at $\sim$3.24 (3.4) eV, respectively. Within BSE, these respective values change to 59 (17) at 2.5 (0.86) eV and 65 (16.6) at 2.68 (3.1) eV. The excitonic effect is found to be crucial in understanding the experimental optical spectra of Mg$_{2}$Si. However, this effect is relatively weaker in Ca$_{2}$Si. Present study highlights the importance of different levels of theoretical approximations for obtaining the optical spectroscopy data of silicides with a high level of accuracy. Finally, we have evaluated PV efficiency by using spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) calculation. On the top of radiative recombination, we have also incorporated non-radiative carrier recombination at a defect trap state via Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) mechanism to evaluate the efficiency. Among the studied defects, the interstitial Mg (Si) is identified as the most stable in Mg$_{2}$Si (Ca$_{2}$Si) and this provides SRH lifetime of 2 $\mu s$ (11.3 $ms$). The estimated maximum SLME using BSE absorption spectrum is 1.3 (31.2)\%, which decreases to 1.2 (28.5)\% due to SRH recombination. The present study suggests that Ca$_{2}$Si (Mg$_{2}$Si) is a potential candidate for single-junction (bottom cell in multi-junction) thin-film PV devices.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) have revealed the formation of flatbands, suggesting that correlation effects are likely to dominate in this system. Yet, a global transport measurement showing distinct signatures of strong correlations like local moments arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower as a sensitive global transport probe for measuring entropy, we unveil the presence of emergent local moments through their impact on entropy. Remarkably, in addition to sign changes at the Dirac point ($\nu = 0$) and full band filling ($\nu = \pm 4$), the thermopower of MATBLG demonstrates additional sign changes at the location, $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$, which do not vary with temperature from $5K$ to $\sim 60K$. This is in contrast to sensitive temperature-dependent crossing points seen in our study on twisted bilayer graphene devices with weaker correlations. Further, we have investigated the effect of magnetic field ($B$) on the thermopower, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$. Our results show a $30\%$ and $50\%$ reduction, respectively, that is consistent with suppression seen in the layered oxide due to the partial polarization of the spin entropy. The observed robust crossing points, together with suppression in a magnetic field, cannot be explained solely from the contributions of band fermions; instead, our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the entropy of the emergent localized moments of a strongly correlated flatband.</p>

            <p>We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moiré bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moiré band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</p>

            <p>We explore the mechanism underlying the anomalous rheology of puller-type microswimmer suspensions through direct hydrodynamic simulations. Puller-type swimmers generate contractile flow fields along their swimming direction, leading to hydrodynamic interactions that cause the swimmers to align vertically. Our simulations reveal that this alignment effect, along with the resultant orientational order of swimming motion, becomes particularly pronounced near boundary walls, where local swimmer density is amplified, predominantly controlling the overall swimming dynamics and rheological properties of the suspension. These findings contrast with our previous simulations of pusher-type swimmers, which hydrodynamically interact through extensile flow fields, whereby they exhibit weak orientational order in the bulk region, which primarily determines their steady-state properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the steady-state behavior near the walls is strongly influenced by the aspect ratio of the microswimmers and the degree of confinement between the walls. Our results highlight the crucial role of microswimmer characteristics, such as shape and swimming mechanisms, in determining the rheological properties of active suspensions.</p>

            <p>We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models, which are inequalities that relate the accuracy of data generation to the entropy production rate, which can be interpreted as the speed of the diffusion dynamics in the absence of the non-conservative force. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide a quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the geodesic of space of the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy relations for the diffusion models with different noise schedules and the different data. We numerically discuss our results for the optimal and suboptimal learning protocols. We also show the inaccurate data generation due to the non-conservative force, and the applicability of our results to data generation from the real-world image datasets.</p>

We propose the mesoscopic device that consists of two separated superconducting islands with proximity induced ferromagnetism deposited on top of the three-dimensional topological insulator. Using the quasiclassical formalism of the Usadel equations we demonstrate that the sign of the diode efficiency can be controlled by magnetization tuning of a single superconducting island. Moreover, we show that the diode efficiency can be substantially increased in such device. We argue that the dramatic increase of the diode efficiency is due to competing contribution of the two superconducting islands to the supercurrent with single helical bands linked through the topological insulator surface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arthur P. Ramirez, Sergey Syzranov</p>
            <p>In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</p>

Using DMRG and mixed boundary conditions-periodic for bosons, open for fermions -- we find an $N$-polaron ground state replacing phase separation at high interspecies repulsion. This tightly bound state of clustered particles emerges due to strong impurity-bath correlations, which induce large impurity-impurity correlations that we quantify via the von Neumann entropy and bipartite mutual information, respectively. This system also reveals a fermionic self-localization effect from a Mott insulator background due to local correlations between the impurities and the bath. The growth of long-range correlations breaks this Mott phase, resulting in the transition to impurity clusters delocalized along the system. Finally, we show that there is a critical impurity number, which depends on intraspecies bosonic interaction, beyond which phase separation is recovered.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surajit Adhikari, Sankhasuvra Das, Priya Johari</p>
            <p>Chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their stability, non-toxicity, small bandgaps, high absorption coefficients, and defect tolerance. Although transition metal-based CPs, particularly those incorporating Zr and Hf, have been well-studied, they often exhibit higher bandgaps, lower charge carrier mobility, and reduced efficiency compared to lead-based halide perovskites (HPs). Tin (Sn), a post-transition metal with a similar oxidation state (+4) as Zr and Hf in ABX$_{3}$ structures but with different valence characteristics, remains underexplored in CPs. Given the influence of valence states on material properties, Sn-based CPs are of great interest. This study employs density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body perturbation theory (GW and BSE) to investigate a series of distorted Sn-based CPs (ASnX$_{3}$, A = Ca, Sr, Ba; X = S, Se). Our results demonstrate that these perovskites are mechanically stable and exhibit lower direct G$_{0}$W$_{0}$ bandgaps (0.79-1.50 eV) compared to their Zr- and Hf-based counterparts. Analysis of carrier-phonon interactions reveals that the charge-separated polaronic state is less stable than the bound exciton state in these materials. Additionally, polaron-assisted charge carrier mobilities for electrons (21.33-416.02 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) and holes (7.02-260.69 cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}) are comparable to or higher than those in lead-based HPs and significantly exceed those of Zr- and Hf-based CPs, owing to reduced carrier-phonon coupling. The estimated spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (24.2%-31.2%)-confirmed through perovskite solar cell (PSC) simulations using SCAPS-1D software-indicates that these materials are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications.</p>

            <p>The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg diamond chain with ferro- and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions is studied. The phase boundary in the parametric space of these interactions is determined, where the transition between the ferromagnetic and other (singlet or ferrimagnetic) ground state phases occurs. On this phase boundary there is a dispersionless (flat) energy band in the one-magnon spectrum and these states can be represented as localized magnons in the trapping cells between neighboring diamonds. The ground state consists of the localized magnons and special magnon complexes and it is macroscopically degenerate. A remarkable feature of the model is the existence, on a certain part of the phase boundary, of two- and three-magnon localized states, forming flat bands in two- and three-magnon spectrum. All these localized states also belong to the ground state manifold, which turns out to be exactly the same as for the system of independent spins-$\frac{3}{2}$. This implies a large macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state $4^n$ ($n$ is number of diamonds in the chain) and a high residual entropy per spin $s_{0}=\frac{2}{3}\ln 2$.</p>

            <p>A key hallmark of quantum Hall physics is the existence of topological chiral states at the system boundary. Signatures of these edge states have been experimentally observed in cold atoms by using different approaches, including notably that of ``synthetic dimension'' in which internal states are coupled together and reinterpreted as sites along an artificial spatial dimension. However, previous atomic synthetic dimension implementations have been limited to relatively small system sizes with inflexible boundaries. In this paper, we propose instead how to use a synthetic dimension of atomic trap states to observe chiral edge states in a large quantum Hall system with a tunable edge. We present numerical simulations for relevant experimental parameters, showing how this scheme may be used to probe the properties and robustness of the edge states to defects. Our work opens the way for future experiments in topological physics with synthetic dimensions, while also providing new ways to manipulate and control highly-excited trap states.</p>

            <p>The Nernst effect of the magnon orbital moment is theoretically investigated in a honeycomb ferromagnet, whose Hamiltonian contains the Heisenberg exchange, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, the Kitaev, and the Zeeman interactions. More specifically, we obtain the magnon band structure, the Berry curvature, the magnon orbital moment Berry curvature, and the magnon orbital moment Nernst conductivity (MOMNC) for the Hamiltonian within the linear spin-wave theory in the polarized phase. We found the magnon orbital moment Berry curvature is largely independent of the sign of the Chern number of the band. For an experimental proposal, we estimate MOMNC of $\mathrm{CrI}_{3}$ for the Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-Zeeman model and Heisenberg-Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-Zeeman model for a perpendicular external magnetic field. We found that certain Kitaev materials provide us with a broad tunability of the MOMNC through a magnetic field. We envision that our findings lead to further investigations of the novel transport properties of the magnon orbital moment.</p>

            <p>We construct a (1+1)-dimension continuum model of 4-component fermions incorporating the exceptional Lie group symmetry $G_2$. Four gapped and five gapless phases are identified via the one-loop renormalization group analysis. The gapped phases are controlled by four different stable $SO(8)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points, among which three exhibit an emergent triality, while the rest one possesses the self-triality, i.e., invariant under the triality mapping. The gapless phases include three $SO(7)$ critical ones, a $G_2$ critical one, and a Luttinger liquid. Three $SO(7)$ critical phases correspond to different $SO(7)$ Gross-Neveu fixed points connected by the triality relation similar to the gapped SO(8) case. The $G_2$ critical phase is controlled by an unstable fixed point described by a direct product of the Ising and tricritical Ising conformal field theories with the central charges $c=\frac{1}{2}$ and $c=\frac{7}{10}$, respectively, while the latter one is known to possess spacetime supersymmetry. In the lattice realization with a Hubbard-type interaction, the triality is broken into the duality between two $SO(7)$ symmetries and the supersymmetric $G_2$ critical phase exhibits the degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states, which are reminiscences of the continuum model.</p>

            <h2>A variational formulation of the free energy of mixed quantum-classical systems: coupling classical and electronic density functional theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillaume Jeanmairet, Emmanuel Giner</p>
            <p>Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on somewhat ambiguous approximations. This paper aims to develop an exact theoretical framework that allows us to clarify the approximations involved in the QM/cDFT formulation and serves as a starting point for further development. We therefore establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum-classical systems within the canonical ensemble. We start with the adiabatic equilibrium density matrix for a system comprising N qm quantum and N mm classical particles and, based on this, we propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full QM/MM density matrix. Taking advantage of permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the quantum and classical one-body densities, thus generalizing both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) for QM/MM systems. We then reformulate the functional in order to explicitly make appear the eDFT and cDFT Levy-Lieb functionals, together with a new universal correlation functional for QM/MM systems. A mean-field approximation is finally introduced in the context of solvation problems and we discuss its connection with several existing mixed cDFT-eDFT schemes.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of the 3D diluted Ising model universality class in a mixture of two magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. J. Ruiz-Lorenzo, M. Dudka, M. Krasnytska, Yu. Holovatch</p>
            <p>Usually, the impact of structural disorder on the magnetic phase transition in the 3D Ising model is analyzed within the framework of quenched dilution by a non-magnetic component, where some lattice sites are occupied by Ising spins, while others are non-magnetic. This kind of quenched dilution, according to the Harris criterion, leads to a change in the critical exponents that govern the asymptotics in the vicinity of the phase transition point. However, the inherent reason for the emergence of a new, random Ising model universality class is not the presence of a non-magnetic component but the disorder in structure of spin arrangement. To demonstrate this fact, in this paper, we set up extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a random mixture of two Ising-like magnets that differ in spin length $s$ and concentration $c$. In doing so, we analyze the effect of structural disorder \textit{per se} without appealing to the presence of a non-magnetic component. We support our numerical simulations with renormalization group calculations. Our results demonstrate the emergence of the 3D randomly diluted Ising model universality class in a random mixture of two Ising magnets. While the asymptotic critical exponents coincide with those known for the site-diluted 3D Ising model, the effective critical behavior is triggered by parameters $s$ and $c$. The impact of their interplay is a subject of detailed analysis.</p>

            <h2>Two-body interaction induced phase transitions and intermediate phases in nonreciprocal non-Hermitian quasicrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalun Zhang, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian phenomena, such as exceptional points, non-Hermitian skin effects, and topologically nontrivial phases have attracted continued attention. In this work, we reveal how interactions and nonreciprocal hopping could collectively influence the behavior of two interacting bosons on quasiperiodic lattices. Focusing on the Bose-Hubbard model with Aubry-André-Harper quasiperiodic modulations and hopping asymmetry, we discover that interactions could enlarge the localization transition point of the noninteracting system into an intermediate mobility edge phase, in which localized doublons formed by bosonic pairs can coexist with delocalized states. Under the open boundary condition, the bosonic doublons could further show non-Hermitian skin effects, realizing doublon condensation at the edges, and their direction of skin-localization can be flexibly tuned by the hopping parameters. A framework is developed to characterize the spectral, localization, and topological transitions accompanying these phenomena. Our work advances the understanding of localization and topological phases in non-Hermitian systems, particularly in relation to multiparticle interactions.</p>

            <p>We introduce a lattice dynamics package which calculates elastic, thermodynamic and thermal transport properties of crystalline materials from data on their force and potential energy as a function of atomic positions. The data can come from density functional theory (DFT) calculations or classical molecular dynamics runs performed in a supercell. First, the model potential parameters, which are anharmonic force constants are extracted from the latter runs. Then, once the anharmonic model is defined, thermal conductivity and equilibrium properties at finite temperatures can be computed using lattice dynamics, Boltzmann transport theories, and a variational principle respectively. In addition, the software calculates the mechanical properties such as elastic tensor, Gruneisen parameters and the thermal expansion coefficient within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA). Phonons, elastic constants and thermodynamic properties results applied to the germanium crystal will be illustrated. Using the force constants as a force field, one may also perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in order to investigate the combined effects of anharmonicity and defect scattering beyond perturbation theory.</p>

            <h2>Grain boundary interstitial segregation in substitutional binary alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zuoyong Zhang, Chuang Deng</p>
            <p>Grain boundary (GB) segregation is a powerful approach for optimizing the thermal and mechanical properties of metal alloys. In this study, we report significant GB interstitial segregation in a representative substitutional binary alloy system (Al-Ni) through atomistic simulations, challenging prevailing assumptions in the literature. Our findings show that Ni atoms preferentially segregate to interstitial sites within numerous kite-like GB structures in the Al bicrystals. An intriguing interplanar interstitial segregation pattern was also observed and analyzed. Additionally, interstitial segregation can induce unexpected GB transitions, such as kite transitions and nano-faceting, due to the existence of small interstitial sites. Building upon these observations, we developed a robust method to systematically identify the interstitial candidate sites for accommodating solutes at GBs. This approach combines site detection with structural filtering to produce distributions of interstitial sites that closely match atomistic simulation results. Applied to nanocrystalline alloys, this method enabled the calculation of interstitial segregation energies, significantly improving GB segregation predictions for the Al-Ni system. Furthermore, machine learning models using smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors successfully predicted per-site interstitial segregation energy. This study highlights the critical role of GB interstitial segregation in advancing our understanding of solute behavior and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation alloys.</p>

            <p>Three liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures are formulated, each containing the MHPOBC compound and the homolog from the 3FmHPhF6 series with m = 4, 5, and 6. The properties of the mixtures are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electro-optic measurements, and UV-Vis-NIR and dielectric spectroscopies. In all mixtures, the smectic A*, smectic C*, and smectic C$_A$* phases are observed. Each mixture can be supercooled and forms the glass of smectic C$_A$* at 225-238 K. The glass transition temperature decreases with the increasing C$_m$H$_{2m}$ chain length in the 3FmHPhF6 molecule. The tilt angle in the smectic C$_A$* phase reaches 36.5-37.5°. The selective reflection of light in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges is observed, with a strong dependence of the reflected light's wavenumber on temperature.</p>

            <h2>Linear-limit aging times of three monoalcohols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Philipp Gabriel, Jeppe C. Dyre, Tina Hecksher</p>
            <p>This paper presents data for the physical aging of the three monoalcohols 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Aging is studied by monitoring the dielectric loss at a fixed frequency in the kHz range following temperature jumps of a few Kelvin's magnitude, starting from states of equilibrium. The three alcohols differ in the Debye relaxation strength and how much the Debye process is separated from the $\alpha$ process. We first demonstrate that single-parameter aging describes all data well and proceed to utilize this fact to identify the linear-limit normalized aging relaxation functions. From the Laplace transform of these functions, the linear-limit aging loss-peak angular frequency defines the inverse of the linear aging relaxation time. This allows for a comparison to the temperature dependence of the Debye and $\alpha$ dielectric relaxation times of the three monoalcohols. We conclude that the aging response for 5-methyl-2-hexanol and 2-ethyl-1-butanol follows the $\alpha$ relaxation, not the Debye process, while no firm conclusion can be reached for 1-phenyl-1-propanol because its Debye and $\alpha$ processes are too close to be reliably distinguished.</p>

            <h2>Uncertainty Quantification for Misspecified Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Danny Perez, Aparna P. A. Subramanyam, Ivan Maliyov, Thomas D. Swinburne</p>
            <p>The use of high-dimensional regression techniques from machine learning has significantly improved the quantitative accuracy of interatomic potentials. Atomic simulations can now plausibly target quantitative predictions in a variety of settings, which has brought renewed interest in robust means to quantify uncertainties on simulation results. In many practical settings, encompassing both classical and a large class of machine learning potentials, the dominant form of uncertainty is currently not due to lack of training data but to misspecification, namely the inability of any one choice of model parameters to exactly match all ab initio training data. However, Bayesian inference, the most common formal tool used to quantify uncertainty, is known to ignore misspecification and thus significantly underestimates parameter uncertainties. Here, we employ a recent misspecification-aware regression technique to quantify parameter uncertainties, which is then propagated to a broad range of phase and defect properties in tungsten via brute force resampling or implicit differentiation. The propagated misspecification uncertainties robustly envelope errors to direct \textit{ab initio} calculation of material properties outside of the training dataset, an essential requirement for any quantitative multi-scale modeling scheme. Finally, we demonstrate application to recent foundational machine learning interatomic potentials, accurately predicting and bounding errors in MACE-MPA-0 energy predictions across the diverse materials project database. Perspectives for the approach in multiscale simulation workflows are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. V. Jyothis, Kallol Mondal, Himanshu Mavani, V. Ravi Chandra</p>
            <p>We study the effect of magnon interactions on the spin wave spectra of the all-in-all-out phase of the pyrochlore nearest neighbour antiferromagnet with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction ($D$). The leading order corrections to spin wave energies indicate a significant renormalisation for commonly encountered strengths of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya term. For low values of $D$ we find a potential instability of the phase itself, indicated by the renormalisation of magnon frequencies to negative values. We have also studied the renormalized spectra in the presence of magnetic fields along three high symmetry directions of the lattice, namely the $[111]$, $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. Generically, we find that for a fixed value of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction renormalized spectra for the lowest band decrease with an increasing strength of the field. We have also analyzed the limits of the two magnon continuum and probed the possibility of magnon decay. For a range of $D$ and the field strength we identify possible parameter regimes where the decay of the higher bands of the system are kinematically allowed.</p>

            <p>Using a recenly-estabilished band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent ${}^1E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$ (or ${}^2E_g\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(8)$). The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of quasicrystals and their approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.</p>

            <p>Following electronic processes in molecules and materials at the level of the quantum mechanical electron wavefunction with angstrom-level spatial resolution and with full access to its femtosecond temporal dynamics is at the heart of ultrafast condensed matter physics. A breakthrough invention allowing experimental access to electron wavefunctions was the reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy data in 2009, termed photoemission orbital tomography (POT). This invention puts ultrafast three-dimensional (3D) POT in reach, with many new prospects for the study of ultrafast light-matter interaction, femtochemistry and photo-induced phase transitions. Here, we develop a synergistic experimental-algorithmic approach to realize the first 3D-POT experiment using a short-pulse extreme ultraviolet light source. We combine a new variant of photoelectron spectroscopy, namely ultrafast momentum microscopy, with a table-top spectrally-tunable high-harmonic generation light source and a tailored algorithm for efficient 3D reconstruction from sparse, undersampled data. This combination dramatically speeds up the experimental data acquisition, while at the same time reducing the sampling requirements to achieve complete 3D information. We demonstrate the power of this approach by full 3D imaging of the frontier orbitals of a prototypical organic semiconductor absorbed on pristine Ag(110).</p>

We describe the general problem, as motivated by Schmid's law, and detail the calculation of hyperplanes in deviatoric stress space, $\mathbb{D}^5$, which describe the criteria for slip on individual slip systems. We focus on finding the intersection of five linearly independent hyperplanes which represent stresses necessary to satisfy the criteria for general plastic deformation. Finally, we describe a method for calculating the inner convex hull of these intersection points, which describe the vertices of the five dimensional polytope that represents the single crystal yield surface. Our method applies to arbitrary crystal structure, allowing for an arbitrary number and type of slip systems and families, considers plastic anisotropy via inter- and intra-family strength anisotropy, and further considers strength anisotropy between slip in the positive and negative direction. We discuss the calculation and possible applications, and share a computational implementation of the calculation of the single crystal yield surface.</p>

            <p>How genes affect tissue scale organization remains a longstanding biological puzzle. As experimental efforts aim to quantify gene expression, chromatin organization, cellular structure, and tissue structure, computational modeling lags behind. To address this gap, we merge a cellular-based tissue model with a nuclear model that includes a deformable lamina shell and chromatin to test multiscale hypotheses linking chromatin and tissue scales. We propose a multiscale hypothesis focusing on brain organoids to explain structural differences between brain organoids built from induced-pluripotent human stem cells and induced-pluripotent gorilla and chimpanzee cells. Recent experiments discover that a cell fate transition from neuroepithelial to radial glial cells includes a new intermediate state delayed in human organoids, which narrows and lengthens cells on the apical side. Experiments show that the transcription factor ZEB2 plays a major role in the emergence of this intermediate state with ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking. We postulate that the enhancement of ZEB2 expression is potentially due to chromatin reorganization in response to mechanical deformations of the nucleus. A larger critical mechanical strain triggers reorganization in human-derived stem cells, causing delayed ZEB2 upregulation compared with genetically close relatives. We test this by exploring how slightly different initial configurations of chromatin reorganize under applied strain, with greater representing less genetically-close relatives. We find that larger configuration discrepancies produce increased differences in the magnitude of chromatin displacement that rise faster than linearly yet slower than exponentially. Changes in chromatin strain and contact maps can reveal species-specific differences, aiding our understanding of how one species differs in structure from another.</p>

            <p>Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error mitigation methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. We developed a novel method that combines ANN for noise mitigation combined with the YBE to generate noisy data. This approach effectively reduces noise in quantum simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the results. The YBE rigorously preserves quantum correlations and symmetries in spin chain simulations in certain classes of integrable lattice models, enabling effective compression of quantum circuits while retaining linear scalability with the number of qubits. This compression facilitates both full and partial implementations, allowing the generation of noisy quantum data on hardware alongside noiseless simulations using classical platforms. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating errors in time-evolving quantum states, providing a scalable framework to enhance quantum computation fidelity, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by performing quantum time dynamics simulations using the Heisenberg XY Hamiltonian on real quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with >99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giorgio Frangi, Sašo Grozdanov</p>
            <p>Conventional wisdom teaches us that the electrical conductivity in a material is the inverse of its resistivity. In this work, we show that when both of these transport coefficients are defined in linear response through the Kubo formulae as two-point correlators of conserved currents in quantum field theory, this Ohm's reciprocity relation is generically violated in theories with dynamical electromagnetism. We then elucidate how in certain special limits (e.g., in the DC limit in the presence of thermal effects, in certain 2+1$d$ conformal theories, and in holographic supersymmetric theories) the reciprocity relation is reinstated as an emergent property of conductive and resistive transport. We also show that if the response of a material is measured with respect to the total electric field that includes quantum corrections, then the reciprocity relation is satisfied by definition. However, in that case, the transport coefficients are given by the photon vacuum polarisation and not the correlators of conserved currents that dominate the hydrodynamic macroscopic late-time transport.</p>

            <p>As an example for the potential use of multi-block chemometric methods to provide improved unsupervised characterization of compositionally complex materials through the integration of multi-modal spectrometric data sets, we analysed spectral data derived from five field instruments (one XRF, two NIR, and two FT-Raman), collected on 76 bedrock samples of diverse composition. These data were analysed by single- and multi- block latent variable models, based on principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). For the single-block approach, PCA and PLS models were generated; whilst hierarchical partial least squares (HPLS) regression was applied for the multi-block modelling. We also tested whether dimensionality reduction resulted in a more computationally efficient muti-block HPLS model with enhanced model interpretability and geological characterization power using the variable influence on projection (VIP) feature selection method. The results showed differences in the characterization power of the five spectrometer data sets for the bedrock samples based on their mineral composition and geological properties; moreover, some spectroscopic techniques under-performed for distinguishing samples by composition. The multi-block HPLS and its VIP-strengthened model yielded a more complete unsupervised geological aggrupation of the samples in a single parsimonious model. We conclude that multi-block HPLS models are effective at combining multi-modal spectrometric data to provide a more comprehensive characterization of compositionally complex samples, and VIP can reduce HPLS model complexity, while increasing its data interpretability. These approaches have been applied here to a geological data set, but are amenable to a broad range of applications across chemical and biomedical disciplines.</p>

Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <h2>Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benedikt M. Reible, Ana Djurdjevac, Luigi Delle Site</p>
            <p>Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Radiation sputtering of hydrocarbon ices at Europa-relevant temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sankhabrata Chandra, Bryana L. Henderson, Murthy S. Gudipati</p>
            <p>The surfaces of some icy moons, such as Jupiter's moon Europa, are heavily bombarded by energetic particles that can alter the surface materials and affect the composition of its exosphere. Detection of CO2 on Europa's surface indicate that Europa's interior may be transporting freshly exposed carbon-containing material to the surface. It is unknown whether this CO2 is a product of radiation of carbon-containing precursors or whether it is present in the initial deposits. Regardless, further radiolysis by high-energy electrons or ions can sputter CO2 (and organic fragments if present) into Europa's exosphere. In this study, we investigate the radiation sputtering of CO2 and organic fragments from hydrocarbon water ice mixtures at different Europa-relevant surface temperatures to identify how its sputtering products evolve over time. This study shows that the sputtering of hydrocarbon water ice leads to the production of mostly CO2, CO, and fragmented hydrocarbons. The onset of sputtered hydrocarbons is immediate, and quickly reaches a steady state, whereas CO2 and CO are formed more gradually. It is found that higher temperatures cause more sputtering, and that there are some notable differences in the distribution of species that are sputtered at different temperatures, indicating local heterogeneity of sputtering yields depending on the surface temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Jun He, Jue Hou, Yi-Chao Liu, Zi-Xi Tan</p>
            <p>In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</p>

            <h2>Direct Observation of Massless Excitons and Linear Exciton Dispersion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luna Y. Liu, Steffi Y. Woo, Jinyuan Wu, Bowen Hou, Cong Su, Diana Y. Qiu</p>
            <p>Excitons -- elementary excitations formed by bound electron-hole pairs -- govern the optical properties and excited-state dynamics of materials. In two-dimensions (2D), excitons are theoretically predicted to have a linear energy-momentum relation with a non-analytic discontinuity in the long wavelength limit, mimicking the dispersion of a photon. This results in an exciton that behaves like a massless particle, despite the fact that it is a composite boson composed of massive constituents. However, experimental observation of massless excitons has remained elusive. In this work, we unambiguously experimentally observe the predicted linear exciton dispersion in freestanding monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) using momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The experimental result is in excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction based on ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Additionally, we identify the lowest dipole-allowed transition in monolayer hBN to be at 6.6 eV, illuminating a long-standing debate about the band gap of monolayer hBN. These findings provide critical insights into 2D excitonic physics and open new avenues for exciton-mediated superconductivity, Bose-Einstein condensation, and high-efficiency optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Axion electrodynamics and giant magnetic birefringence in Weyl excitonic insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Grigoreva, Anton Andreev, Leonid Glazman</p>
            <p>We study electromagnetic (EM) response of the excitonic insulator phase of time-reversal invariant Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Because of the chiral anomaly and the chiral magnetic effect in the parent WSM, the phase of the exciton condensate couples to the EM fields as a massive dynamical axion. Although the translational symmetry of the WSM is broken in the excitonic insulator state, the axion field is not related to the phase of the sliding exciton density wave. The axion mass is generated by the inter-band matrix elements of electron-electron interactions, and is much smaller than the gap in the single-particle spectrum. Due to the small axion mass, in the presence of a magnetic field, the axion coupling to EM fields produces giant anisotropic polarizability and birefringence. The photon-axion hybridization produces a polariton resonance near the axion gap.</p>

            <h2>Plasmonic waveguides in two-dimensional materials: a quantum mechanical description using semiclassical techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. M. Koskamp, M. I. Katsnelson, K. J. A. Reijnders</p>
            <p>Plasmons are likely to play an important role in integrated photonic ciruits, because they strongly interact with light and can be confined to subwavelength scales. These plasmons can be guided and controlled by plasmonic waveguides, which can be created by patterning different materials or by structuring the dielectric environment. We have constructed a semi-analytical theory to describe plasmonic waveguides, and, more generally, plasmons in spatially inhomogeneous systems. Our theory employs techniques from semiclassical analysis, and is therefore applicable when the electron wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of changes in the system parameters. We obtain an effective classical Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of quantum plasmons, given by the Lindhard function with spatially varying parameters. Adding the wave-like character of the plasmons to the classical trajectories generated by this Hamiltonian, we find two different mechanisms for waveguiding. In the first case, a localized plasmonic state arises due to total internal reflection similar to photonic waveguides. The second mechanism relies on a varying dielectric environment, which locally modifies the screening of the electrons. Here, a quasi-localized state arises due to local changes in the amplitude of the plasmonic excitation. Our results provide a solid basis to understand previous numerical studies.</p>

            <h2>Formation of Frustrated Charge Density Waves in Kagome Metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</h2>

            <p>The charge density wave (CDW), a translational symmetry breaking electronic liquid, plays a pivotal role in correlated quantum materials, such as high-T$_c$ superconductors and topological semimetals. Recently, CDWs that possibly intertwine with superconductivity and magnetism are observed in various kagome metals. However, the nature of CDWs and the role of the Fermi surface (FS) topology in these materials remain an unresolved challenge. In this letter, we reveal the formation of CDWs in the newly discovered kagome metal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. We observe a precursor CDW correlation that features a "yield sign"-like hollow triangle diffuse scattering pattern and nearly complete softening of a flat optical phonon band near Q$_H$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/2). The scattering intensity of the precursor CDW displays divergent behavior as decreasing temperature until T$_{CDW}$=70 K, where a competing CDW at Q$_{CDW}$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) emerges. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we image the frustrated CDW patterns that show a short phase coherence length about ~20 nm in real space. Combined with first principles calculations, our observations support frustrated lattice interactions that are modulated by the FS topology. These results shed light on the interplay between FS and CDW in quantum materials with nearly degenerate structural deformation patterns.</p>

            <h2>Orbital-excitation-dominated magnetization dissipation and quantum oscillation of Gilbert damping in Fe films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yue Chen, Haoran Chen, Xi Shen, Weizhao Chen, Yi Liu, Yizheng Wu, Zhe Yuan</p>
            <p>Using first-principles electronic structure calculation, we demonstrate the spin dissipation process in bulk Fe by orbital excitations within the energy bands of pure spin character. The variation of orbitals in the intraband transitions provides an efficient channel to convert spin to orbital angular momentum with spin-orbit interaction. This mechanism dominates the Gilbert damping of Fe below room temperature. The theoretical prediction is confirmed by the ferromagnetic resonance experiment performed on single-crystal Fe(001) films. A significant thickness-dependent damping oscillation is found at low temperature induced by the quantum well states of the corresponding energy bands. Our findings not only explain the microscopic nature of the recently reported ultralow damping of Fe-based alloys, but also help for the understanding of the transport and dissipation process of orbital currents.</p>

            <p>Nanoscale polar structures are significant for understanding polarization processes in low-dimensional systems and hold potential for developing high-performance electronics. Here, we demonstrate a polar vortex superstructure arising from the reconstructed moiré patterns in twisted bilayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals spatially modulated charge polarization, while theoretical simulations indicate that the in-plane polarization field forms an array of polar vortices. Notably, this polar field is gate-tunable, exhibiting an unconventional gate-tunable polar sliding and screening process. Moreover, its interaction with electron correlations in twisted bilayer graphene leads to modulated correlated states. Our findings establish moiré pattern reconstruction as a powerful strategy for engineering nanoscale polar structures and emergent quantum phases in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <h2>Finite-momentum dielectric function and excitonic effects from time-dependent density-functional theory with dielectrically screened hybrid functionals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Didarul Alam, Jiuyu Sun, Carsten A. Ullrich</p>
            <p>This paper studies the performance of time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) for calculating the dielectric function of semiconductors and insulators at finite momentum transfer, comparing against the standard Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Specifically, we consider a recently proposed hybrid approach that mixes dielectrically screened exact exchange with a semilocal functional, and we also introduce a new hybrid functional featuring a truncated dielectric screening scheme. The computational effort of these hybrid TDDFT approaches is significantly less than that of the BSE, but they deliver comparable accuracy, as demonstrated for the semiconductors Si and GaN and the wide-band insulator LiF. This opens up possibilities for calculating exciton dispersions and electron energy loss functions efficiently and accurately for a wide range of materials.</p>

            <p>The quantum states of matter reorganize themselves in response to defects, giving rise to emergent local excitations that imprint unique characteristics of the host states. While magnetic impurities are known to generate Kondo screening in a Fermi liquid and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in a conventional superconductor, it remains unclear whether they can evoke distinct phenomena in the kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (where A is K, Rb or Cs), which may host an orbital-antiferromagnetic charge density wave (CDW) state and an unconventional superconducting state driven by the convergence of topology, geometric frustration and electron correlations. In this work, we visualize the local density of states induced near various types of impurities in both the CDW and superconducting phases of CsV3-xMxSb5 (M = Ta, Cr) using scanning tunneling microscopy. We observe Kondo resonance states near magnetic Cr dopants. Notably, unlike in any known metal or CDW compound, the spatial pattern of Kondo screening breaks all in-plane mirror symmetries of the kagome lattice, suggesting an electronic chirality due to putative orbital loop currents. While Cooper pairs show relative insensitivity to nonmagnetic impurities, native V vacancies with weak magnetic moments induce a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). This ZBCP coexists with trivial YSR states within the superconducting gap and does not split in energy with increasing tunneling transmission, tending instead to saturate. This behavior is reminiscent of signature of Majorana zero modes, which could be trapped by a sign-change boundary in the superconducting order parameter near a V vacancy, consistent with a surface topological superconducting state. Our findings provide a new approach to exploring novel quantum states on kagome lattices.</p>

            <p>The newly-discovered chromium-based kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 has garnered significant interest due to its strong electron correlations, intertwined orders and potential for unconventional superconductivity under high pressure. However, the nature of superconducting and magnetic interactions during the transition from the parent compound CsV3Sb5 to CsCr3Sb5 remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance which intertwines with the superconducting gap, facilitated by the introduction of magnetic Cr impurities into the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. In addition to the gradual suppression of long-ranged charge-density-wave orders, dilute Cr dopants induce local magnetic moments, giving rise to the emergence of Kondo resonances. In addition, the Kondo resonance forms spatially anisotropic ripple-like structures around the Cr dopants, breaking all local mirror symmetries. This anisotropy arises from the antiferromagnetic coupling between itinerant electrons and the Cr-induced spin-up electrons. Remarkably, as the Kondo screening develops, the coherence peak and depth of superconducting gap with finite zero-energy conductance significantly enhances. It indicates that non-superconducting pairs at the Fermi surface in the parent compound participate in the Kondo effect, effectively screening the magnetic moments of Cr dopants while simultaneously enhancing the superfluid density. Our findings pave a unique pathway for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and local magnetic moments in kagome systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eeli O. Lamponen, Sofia K. Pöntys, Päivi Törmä</p>
            <p>We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sajjan Sheoran, Pratibha Dev</p>
            <p>The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is an efficient tool for detecting the Néel vector in collinear compensated magnets with spin-split bands, known as altermagnets (AMs). Here, we establish design principles for obtaining non-zero anomalous Hall conductivity in the recently proposed two-dimensional (2D) AMs using spin and magnetic group symmetry analysis. We show that only two of the seven nontrivial spin layer groups exhibit an unconventional in-plane AHE in which the Néel vector lies within the plane of the Hall current. Through first-principles simulations on bilayers of MnPSe$_3$ and MnSe, we demonstrate the validity of our group theoretic framework for obtaining AHE with $d$ and $i$-wave altermagnetic orders, depending on the stacking of the bilayers. We find that the spin group symmetry is successful in determining the linear and cubic dependence of anomalous Hall conductivity in Néel vector space, although AHE is a relativistic effect. This work shows that the AHE in 2D AMs can probe the altermagnetic order and Néel vector reversal, thereby facilitating the miniaturization of altermagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>We report on the charge dynamics of kagome FeGe, an antiferromagnet with a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \simeq 105$ K, using polarized infrared spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We reveal pronounced optical anisotropy along the $a$- and $c$-axis, as well as an unusual response associated with three-dimensional CDW order. Above $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$, there is a notable transfer of spectral weight (SW) from high to low energies, promoted by the magnetic splitting-induced shift in bands. Across the CDW transition, we observe a sudden SW transfer from low to high energies over a broad range, along with the emergence of new excitations around 1200 cm$^{-1}$. These results contrast with observations from other kagome metals like CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, where the nesting of VHSs leads to a clear CDW gap feature. Instead, our findings can be accounted for by a $2\times2\times2$ CDW ground state driven by a first-order structural transition involving large partial Ge1-dimerization. Our study thus unveils a complex interplay among structure, magnetism, and charge order, offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of CDW order in FeGe.</p>

            <p>The two-dimensional (2D) Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer stands out for its combined ferromagnetic (FM), ferroelectric (FE), and metallic properties, marking itself as a prominent 2D multiferroic metal. This work studies those properties and the relevant physics, using density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics. Our results show that Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer is in the Cr$^{3+}$ $t_{2g}^3$ state with $S$ = 3/2 and Cu$^{1+}$ $3d^{10}$ with $S$ = 0. The observed in-plane magnetic anisotropy primarily arises from exchange anisotropy, which is associated with the Cr-Se-Cr itinerant ferromagnetism. In contrast, both single-ion anisotropy and shape magnetic anisotropy contribute negligibly. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is also quite weak, only about 3\% of the intralayer exchange parameters. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a FM Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) of 190 K. Moreover, the monolayer exhibits a vertical FE polarization of 1.79 pC/m and a FE polarization switching barrier of 182 meV/f.u., and the FE state remains stable above room temperature as shown by $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, a magnetoelectric coupling is partially manifested by a magnetization rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane associated with a FE-to-paraelectric transition. The magnetization rotation can also be induced by either hole or electron doping, and the hole doping increases the $T_{\rm C}$ up to 238 K. In addition, tensile strain reduces the FE polarization but enhances $T_{\rm C}$ to 290 K, while a compressive strain gives an opposite effect. Therefore, the multiferroic metallic Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer may be explored for advanced multifunctional electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking, arising from the competition of interactions and quantum fluctuations, is fundamental to understanding ordered electronic phases. Although electrically neutral, optical excitations like excitons can interact through their dipole moment, raising the possibility of optically active ordered phases. The effects of spontaneous ordering on optical properties remain largely unexplored. Recent observations of the excitonic Mott insulating state in semiconducting moiré crystals make them promising for addressing this question. Here, we present evidence for an in-plane ferroelectric phase of dipolar moiré excitons driven by strong exciton-exciton interactions. We discover a surprising speed-up of photon emission at late times and low densities in excitonic decay. This counterintuitive behavior is attributed to collective radiance, linked to the transition between disordered and symmetry-broken ferroelectric phases of moiré excitons. Our findings provide first evidence for strong dipolar inter-site interactions in moiré lattices, demonstrate collective photon emission as a probe for moiré quantum materials, and pave the way for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daan Vrancken, Simon Ganne, Daan Verraes, Tom Braeckevelt, Lukas Devos, Jutho Haegeman, Veronique Van Speybroeck</p>
            <p>We present a high-accuracy procedure for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. The approach involves downfolding the full Hilbert space into a low-energy subspace that captures the most significant electron correlations, leading to an effective Hubbard model. This generalized model is then solved using tensor network methods. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps exhibit quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability.</p>

            <p>The kagome lattice stands as a rich platform for hosting a wide array of correlated quantum phenomena, ranging from charge density waves and superconductivity to electron nematicity and loop current states. Direct detection of loop currents in kagome systems has remained a formidable challenge due to their intricate spatial arrangements and the weak magnetic field signatures they produce. This has left their existence and underlying mechanisms a topic of intense debate. In this work, we uncover a hallmark reconcilable with loop currents: spin handedness-selective signals that surpass conventional dichroic, spin, and spin-dichroic responses. We observe this phenomenon in the kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and we call it the anomalous spin-optical helical effect. This effect arises from the coupling of light' s helicity with spin-orbital electron correlations, providing a groundbreaking method to visualize loop currents in quantum materials. Our discovery not only enriches the debate surrounding loop currents but also paves the way for new strategies to exploit the electronic phases of quantum materials via light-matter interaction.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We find that the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic, has a spin-texture with an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy that is revealed in measurements of the in-plane critical field in the superconducting state, as well as from quantum corrections to the magnetoresistance in the normal state. This spin texture is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic overlayers provide a unique probe of spin textures and related phenomena in heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Recently, the Pr-doped Ruddlesden-Popper phase of bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been reported to exhibit a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 82.5 K and superconducting volume fraction of about 57 % at high pressure. However, the effect of Pr-doping on La3Ni2O7 remains unclear. Here, we studied the crystal structures and electronic properties of Pr-doped La3Ni2O7 at 0 and 15 GPa based on the first-principles calculations to explore the doping effect of Pr. Our findings indicate that the praseodymium atoms prefer to occupy the outer La-O layers site. We then investigated the evolution of crystal structures in both the ambient pressure phase and high pressure phase of La3Ni2O7 as a function of doping concentration, revealing inconsistent trends in their evolution with increasing doping levels. Finally, by fitting the bilayer two-orbital model, we propose that doping Pr may benefit for superconductivity of La3Ni2O7. These results not only can help the further experimental search of RP phase nickelate at lower pressure, but also provide helpful guide for understanding the effect of chemical pressure in isovalent doped RP phase nickelate superconductor.</p>

            <h2>Manipulation of topological phase transitions and the mechanism of magnetic interactions in Eu-based Zintl-phase materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo-Xuan Li, Ziyin Song, Zhong Fang, Zhijun Wang, Hongming Weng</p>
            <p>Various topological phases, including topological insulators, topological semimetals, and topological superconductors, along with the controllable topological phase transitions, have attracted considerable attention due to their promising applications in spintronics and quantum computing. In this work, we propose two distinct methods for manipulating topological phase transitions in magnetic materials. First, by varying the strength of electron correlation effects, we induce a series of topological state transitions within the EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M = Zn, Cd; X = P, As, Sb) family of Zintl materials, including magnetic topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) and magnetic Dirac semimetals. Our findings indicate that strong electron correlation effects tend to influence the emergence of topological phases. Second, by reducing the electronegativity of the pnictogen X (from P to As and Sb), we observe a similar transition from trivial insulator to magnetic Dirac semimetal or magnetic TCI. This suggests that weaker electronegativity favors the emergence of topological phases. Furthermore, we establish a Heisenberg model to describe the magnetic interactions of the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system, based on which we perform Monte Carlo simulations of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, yielding Néel temperatures that perfectly match experimental data. This suggests that the local magnetic moment framework provides an accurate description of the magnetization behavior in this family of materials. This work provides the potential for the experimental manipulation of topological phase transitions and their possible applications, while also enhancing the understanding of the magnetic interactions within the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system and offering a theoretical foundation for future applications in magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Detecting Topological Phase Transition in Superconductor-Semiconductor Hybrids by Electronic Raman Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takeshi Mizushima, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>In superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, applying a magnetic field closes a trivial bulk gap and causes a topological phase transition (TPT), resulting in the emergence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of the wires. However, trivial Andreev bound states formed at the interface with metallic leads mimic the local Majorana properties, making it difficult to detect the TPT through local conductance measurements. In this work, we investigate the detection of the bulk TPT by exploiting the static and dynamic density response of the hybrid system. In particular, we demonstrate that the dynamical renormalized responses reveal the characteristic electronic structure and detect the TPT, which we then show to produce strong intensities of Raman scattering. Furthermore, we find that gapless plasmons emerge in the normal state, signaling the bulk Lifshitz transition. Our results thus predict that the bulk response of superconducting nanowires is a powerful spectroscopic approach to detect the bulk topological phase transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zohreh Jalilvand, Daniele Notarmuzi, Ubaldo M. Córdova-Figueroa, Emanuela Bianchi, Ilona Kretzschmar</p>
            <p>In this study, Brownian Dynamics simulations are implemented to investigate the motion of a bottom-heavy Janus particle near a wall under varying shear flow conditions and at small Péclet (Pe) numbers. The stochastic motion of the Janus particle impacted by surface forces is described using a set of coupled Langevin equations that takes into account the Janus particle orientation. Interactions arising from surface potentials are found to depend on the separation distance between the Janus particle and the wall, the properties of the surfaces involved, and the thickness of the Janus particle cap. When shear flow is introduced in the system, the dynamical behavior of the Janus particle is also governed by the strain rate. Furthermore, the effect of friction on the dynamical behavior of the Janus particle under shear flow is investigated and reveals that the rotational motion of the Janus particle slows down slightly when the particle is close to the surface. In summary, we demonstrate the ability to utilize Brownian Dynamics simulations to capture the rich dynamical behavior of a bottom-heavy Janus particle near a wall and under a range of shear flow conditions, cap thicknesses, and surface charges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristian Løvås Svalland, Maria Teresa Mercaldo, Mario Cuoco</p>
            <p>We study topological transitions in one dimensional superconductors that can harbor multiple edge Majorana bound states protected by chiral symmetry. The chiral symmetry arises due to the structure of the internal spin degrees of freedom of the superconductor and it can be guided by the coupling of the superconductor with sources of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We then consider distinct regions of the phase diagram in the parameters space that are marked by gapless excitations in the spectrum and evaluate the conditions for inducing a topological transition. We show that for gapless chiral symmetric superconductors one can identify a class of physical perturbations that enable a gap opening in the spectrum, without breaking chirality, and turn the system into a topological state. This type of superconductor is dubbed marginal topological superconductor because an infinitesimally small perturbation is able to induce a transition into a topological nontrivial phase. To explicitly demonstrate and evaluate the character of the transitions from gapless to topological gapfull phases we explore different physical cases including $p$-wave superconductor in the presence of an applied magnetic field or proximity-coupled to a ferromagnet, and $s$-wave superconductor in a noncollinear magnetic ordering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grant Z. X. Yang, Zi-Ting Sun, Ying-Ming Xie, K. T. Law</p>
            <p>Planar Josephson junctions are pivotal for engineering topological superconductivity, yet are severely hindered by orbital effects induced by in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we introduce the generic topological altermagnetic Josephson junctions (TAJJs) by leveraging the intrinsic spin-polarized band splitting and zero net magnetization attributes of altermagnets. Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital effects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the junction. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEMs emerge in $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave TAJJs but vanish in the $d_{xy}$-wave configuration, thereby establishing the crystallographic orientation angle $\theta$ of the altermagnet as a novel control parameter of topology. The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs provides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved measurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our proposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally. Overall, this work establishes altermagnets as a versatile paradigm for realizing topological superconductivity, bridging conceptual innovations with scalable quantum architectures devoid of orbital effects and stray fields.</p>

            <h2>Quantum-vacuum-protected topological edge polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raditya Weda Bomantara</p>
            <p>This paper uncovers the formation of topological edge polaritons that are protected by the presence of quantum vacuum. Such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons could be achieved in a system of neutral atomic lattice under appropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the light-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which consequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the system is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit, i.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On the other hand, by treating both the atomic and photonic degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full (atomic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of topological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge and with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such quantum-vacuum-protected edge polaritons against spatial disorder and counterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.</p>

            <p>Ultracold dipolar hard-core bosons in optical ladders provide exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of anisotropic XXZ spin ladders. We show that introducing a tilt along the rungs results in a rich phase diagram at unit filling. In particular, for a sufficiently strong dipolar strength, the interplay between the long-range tail of the dipolar interactions and the tilting leads to the emergence of a quantum floating phase, a critical phase with incommensurate density-density correlations. Interestingly, the study of the entanglement spectrum, reveals that the floating phase is topological, constituting an intermediate gapless stage in the melting of a crystal into a gapped topological Haldane phase. This novel scenario for topological floating phases in dipolar XXZ ladders can be investigated in on-going experiments.</p>

            <p>We determine the asymptotic relaxation rate of a Brownian particle in a harmonic potential perturbed by quenched Gaussian disorder, a simplified model for rugged energy landscapes in complex systems. Depending on the properties of the disorder, we show that the mean and variance of the asymptotic relaxation rate are non-monotonous functions of the parameters for a broad class of disorders. In particular, the rate of relaxation may either increase or decrease exponentially compared to the unperturbed case. This implies that disorder may, depending on its properties, both significantly speed up \textit{and} slow down relaxation. In the limit of weak disorder, we derive the probability distribution of the asymptotic relaxation rate and show that it is Gaussian, with analytic expressions for the mean and variance that feature universal limits. Our findings indicate that controlled disorder may serve to tune the relaxation speed in complex systems.</p>

            <p>The transport properties (electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity) of iron-hydrogen alloys are of great significance in the stability and evolution of planetary magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the thermal transport properties of iron doped with varying hydrogen content as functions of pressure (P) and temperature (T) for the top and bottom of Earth's outer core and beyond, corresponding to pressures of about 130 to 300 GPa and temperatures of 4000 to 7000 K. Using first-principles density functional theory molecular dynamic simulations (FPMD), we verify that crystalline FeH$_x$ is superionic with H diffusing freely. We find a low frequency viscosity of 10-11 mPa$\cdot$s for liquid Fe-H alloys at Earth's outer core conditions. We find saturation of electrical resistivity with increasing temperatures in liquid iron at outer core conditions. The effect of H on electrical and thermal transport we find is small, so that the exact H content of the core is not needed. The primary effect of H is on the equation of state, decreasing the density at constant P and T. We find the Lorenz number is smaller than the ideal value, and obtain for X(H)= 0.20, or 0.45 wt% H , thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of $\sim$105 and $\sim$190 $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$, respectively, at conditions near the core-mantle and inner-outer core boundary.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetic superconductors offer the possibility of exploring unconventional superconductivity, including topological states and finite-momentum superconductivity, with promising applications in spintronics and quantum information. However, a direct experimental confirmation of their existence remains elusive. In this work, we propose non-magnetic impurities as probes of the interplay between altermagnetism and superconductivity. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states whose spatial extension reflects the magnetic order of the substrate material. Depending on whether the impurity respects the bulk symmetries or not, these states form spin-degenerate or spin-split doublets. An external magnetic field aligned with the Néel vector can further control the doublet splitting. We further demonstrate that coupling between impurity states leads to a position-dependent, spin-sensitive hybridization, enabling a new approach for in-situ control of atomic-size quantum devices. These findings provide unambiguous experimental signatures of altermagnetic superconductivity accessible via local measurements like scanning tunneling microscopy and open new avenues for designing tunable quantum materials.</p>

            <p>When a millimetric body is placed atop a vibrating liquid bath, the relative motion between the object and interface generates outward propagating waves with an associated momentum flux. Prior work has shown that isolated chiral objects, referred to as spinners, can thus rotate steadily in response to their self-generated wavefield. Here, we consider the case of two co-chiral spinners held at a fixed spacing from one another but otherwise free to interact hydrodynamically through their shared fluid substrate. Two identical spinners are able to synchronize their rotation, with their equilibrium phase difference sensitive to their spacing and initial conditions, and even cease to rotate when the coupling becomes sufficiently strong. Non-identical spinners can also find synchrony provided their intrinsic differences are not too disparate. A hydrodynamic wave model of the spinner interaction is proposed, recovering all salient features of the experiment. In all cases, the spatially periodic nature of the capillary wave coupling is directly reflected in the emergent equilibrium behaviors.</p>

            <p>Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</p>

On interfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, an inner region still adopts a cylindrical shape while the outer region is under azimuthal compression. Numerical energy minimization confirm our predictions and show that this behavior holds for finite slopes.

            <p>While non-Hermitian (NH) topological phases and phenomena have been observed across various quantum systems, directly measuring NH topological invariants remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a generic and unified framework for the direct measurement of various NH topological invariants in odd-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. We demonstrate that in one-dimensional (1D) NH systems with sublattice symmetry, the line-gap winding number and point-gap braiding degree can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamically constructed field based on post-quench spin textures. Specifically, line-gap topology is characterized by integer-valued winding, whereas point-gap complex-band braiding is revealed by half-integer or integer winding with abrupt jumps. We also extend our approach to higher-dimensional winding numbers and non-Bloch topological invariants under open-boundary conditions. Additionally, we propose a practical cold-atom setup to realize and detect 1D NH topological phases, showing that our dynamical measurement scheme is feasible in current experimental settings. This work paves the way for the direct measurement of NH topological invariants in quantum systems.</p>

By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced.

            <h2>Quantum transport of Dirac fermions in selected graphene nanosystems away from the charge-neutrality point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Rycerz</p>
            <p>Peculiar electronic properties of graphene, including the universal dc conductivity and the pseudodiffusive shot noise, are usually attributed to a small vicinity of the charge-neutrality point, away from which electron's effective mass raises, and nanostructures in graphene start to behave similarly to familiar Sharvin contacts in semiconducting heterostructures hosting two-dimensional electron gas. Using the effective Dirac equation for low-energy excitations it can be shown that, as long as abrupt potential steps separate the sample area from the leads, graphene-specific features can be identified even relatively far from the charge-neutrality point. Namely, the conductance is reduced, comparing to the standard Sharvin value, whereas the shot noise is amplified. Here, we confront the results of earlier analytic considerations with numerical simulations of quantum transport on the honeycomb lattice, for selected systems for which considerations starting from the Dirac equation cannot be directly adapted. For a wedge-shape constriction with zigzag edges and approximately square shape of the narrowest section, the transport characteristics can be tuned from graphene-specific sub-Sharvin values to standard Sharvin values, depending on whether the electrostatic potential profile in the narrowest section is rectangular or smooth. The half-Corbino disk with rectangular potential profile exhibits both the conductance and the noise close to the sub-Sharvin values. For a circular quantum dot with two narrow openings and irregular edges, the conductance is close to the Sharvin value, and the Fano factor approaches the value of $F=1/4$. This suggests that, in experimental attempt to verify the predictions for sub-Sharvin transport regime, one should focus rather on nanosystems, for which the scatterings on edges are insignificant next to the scatterings on sample-lead interfaces.</p>

            <p>In 1965 Kohn and Luttinger proposed a genuine electronic mechanism for superconductivity. Despite the bare electrostatic interaction between two electrons being repulsive, in a metal electron-hole fluctuations can give rise to Friedel oscillations of the screened Coulomb potential. Cooper pairing among the electrons then emerges when taking advantage of the attractive regions. The nature of the leading pairing mechanism in some two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is still debated. Focusing on NbSe$_2$, we show that superconductivity can be induced by the Coulomb interaction when accounting for screening effects on the trigonal lattice with multiple orbitals. Using ab initio-based tight-binding parametrizations for the relevant low-energy d-bands, we evaluate the screened interaction microscopically, in a scheme including Bloch overlaps. In the direct space, we find long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign, a key to the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The momentum-resolved gap equations predict two degenerate solutions at the critical temperature Tc, signaling the unconventional nature of the pairing. Their complex linear combination, i.e., a chiral gap with p-like symmetry, provides the ground state of the system. Our prediction of a fully gapped chiral phase well below Tc is in excellent agreement with the spectral function extracted from tunneling spectroscopy measurements of single-layer NbSe$_2$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saifuddin Zafar, Mashaekh Tausif Ehsan, Sourav Das Suvro, Mohammad Nasim Hasan, Mahmudul Islam</p>
            <p>Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</p>

By analyzing band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics across various MX2 compounds, we comprehensively examine their electronic properties and chemical bonding behavior. The results reveal that charge transfer plays a crucial role in electron mass fluctuations, with topological geometric analysis further confirming the impact of mass variations on atomic bonding and electronic states.

            <h2>Andreev non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for open Josephson junctions from Green's functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roberto Capecelatro, Marco Marciani, Gabriele Campagnano, Procolo Lucignano</p>
            <p>We investigate the transport properties of open Josephson junctions (JJs) through a minimal effective non-Hermitian (NH) approach derived from the equilibrium Green's function (GF) formalism. Specifically, we consider a JJ with a quantum dot barrier coupled to a normal metal reservoir. The coupling introduces an imaginary self-energy term in the JJ Hamiltonian which can be naturally accounted for in the NH formalism. While most approaches to similar problems work with the full junction Hamiltonian we propose a scheme for deriving an effective NH Hamiltonian for the Andreev levels only, that we compute from the singular part of the barrier GF. To establish the range of applicability of this NH model we benchmark our results for both the dot density of states and the supercurrent against exact GF predictions in different transport regimes. We find that, as a rule of thumb, the Andreev NH description is accurate when the spectral overlap between the Andreev bound states (ABS) and the near-gap continuum states is negligible, i.e. when the ABS energies lie sufficiently far from the superconducting gap relative to their line-width. This method not only highlights the effective physics of the JJ but also offers a scalable framework for studying large-size devices.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</p>

            <h2>Electrically Tunable Interband Collective Excitations in Biased Bilayer and Trilayer Graphene</h2>

            <p>Collective excitations of charged particles under the influence of an electromagnetic field give rise to a rich variety of hybrid light-matter quasiparticles with unique properties. In metals, intraband collective response manifested by negative permittivity leads to plasmon-polaritons with extreme field confinement, wavelength squeezing, and potentially low propagation losses. In contrast, photons in semiconductors commonly couple to interband collective response in the form of exciton polaritons, which give rise to completely different polaritonic properties, described by a superposition of the photon and exciton and an anti-crossing of the eigenstates. In this work, we identify the existence of plasmon-like collective excitations originating from the interband excitonic response of biased bilayer and trilayer graphene, in the form of graphene-exciton-polaritons (GEPs). We find that GEPs possess electrically tunable polaritonic properties and discover that such excitations follow a universal dispersion law for all surface polaritons in 2D excitonic systems. Accounting for nonlocal corrections to the excitonic response, we find that the GEPs exhibit confinement factors that can exceed those of graphene plasmons, and with moderate losses. These predictions of plasmon-like interband collective excitations in biased graphene systems open up new research avenues for tunable polaritonic phenomena based on excitonic systems, and the ability to control and manipulate such phenomena at the atomic scale.</p>

In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</p>

            <h2>Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritha Dolai, Arghya Das</p>
            <p>We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, violation of Fourier's law, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a Seebeck-like effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active particles driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</p>

            <p>In this study, the crystal structure and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x} A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds with magnetic rare earth elements ($A$' = Sm, Gd) have been investigated combining X-ray powder diffraction and magnetic measurements. These intergrowth compounds crystallize in a mixture of 2$H$ hexagonal (Ce$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$-type) and 3$R$ rhombohedral (Gd$_{2}$Co$_{7}$-type) polymorphic structures which are related to the stacking of [$AB_{5}$] and [$A_{2}B_{4}$] subunits along the $c$-this http URL average cell volume decreases linearly versus $A$' content, whereas the $c/a$ ratio reaches a minimum at $x$ = 1, due to geometric constraints upon $A$' for La substitution between the two different subunits. The magnetic properties strongly depend on the structure type and the $A$' content. Hexagonal La$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$ is a weak antiferromagnet (wAFM) at low field and temperature and undergoes metamagnetic transitions towards weak ferromagnetic state (wFM) under applied field. Under an applied field of 0.1 T, La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ intermetallic compounds display two different transition temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ that both increase with $x$. $T_{1}$ is associated with a wFM-wAFM transition in the 2$H$ phase for $A$'= Sm, whereas $T_{2}$ is related to the Curie temperature of both 2$H$ and 3$R$ phases. A metamagnetic behaviour is observed between $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ with transition field $\mu_{0}H_{Trans}$ between 2 and 3.5 T for compounds with $A$' = Sm. The La$_{2-x}Sm_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ > 0} behave as hard magnets with a large coercive field $\mu_{0}H_{C}$ at low temperature ($\mu_{0}H_{C}$ > 9 T at 5 K for $x$ = 2), whereas the La$_{2-x} Gd_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ > 0) are soft ferrimagnets with a linear increase of the saturation magnetization versus Gd content.</p>

            <p>In a superconductor electrons form pairs despite the Coulomb repulsion as a result of an effective attractive interaction mediated by, for example phonons. In the present paper DeGennes' description of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction is adopted for the effective interaction. This model is generalized by including the elastic response of the charge-compensating background and the BCS gap equation is solved for the resulting effective electron-electron interaction. It is demonstrated that the superconducting critical temperature becomes strongly enhanced when the material is tuned close to a structural instability.</p>

Therefore, our work establishes a versatile framework for exploring exotic quantum phases and non-Abelian edge states in number-conserving systems.</p>

            <p>In view of their advantages for memory and storage applications, the quest to find suitable magnetic thin film heterostructures that can exhibit strong spin pumping effect persists in the scientific community. Here, the spin pumping phenomenon is investigated in Ta/Galfenol (FeGa) thin film heterostructures by systematically varying the thickness of the heavy metallic Ta underlayer (UL). The films exhibit soft magnetic property with a bcc-phase with a notably low Gilbert damping obtained for FeGa on Si (100). The precessional magnetization dynamics of Ta/FeGa films are explored using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry, revealing the presence of a resonant Kittel mode and additional strain-induced modes. The lowest value of effective Gilbert damping in Ta/FeGa is obtained as ~ 0.015, which rises by ~ 65 % as the thickness of UL increases. Spin pumping and two-magnon scattering mechanisms are validated using a ballistic spin transport model. An overall effective spin mixing conductance value of ~ 5.48 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ is found, which is the highest value ever reported in magnetostrictive Galfenol films. Additionally, micromagnetic simulations are performed to understand the effect of tilted magnetic anisotropy on the formation of magnetic modes in these films. These findings in FeGa films establish it as an effective spin source material and offer innovative ideas to control spin-wave propagation and diverse applications in straintronics.</p>

These giant vortices are stationary, obtainable by imaginary-time propagation using a Gaussian initial state, while the appropriate phase of the giant vortex is imprinted on the initial wave function. The dynamical stability of the giant vortices is established by real-time propagation during a long interval of time after a small change of a parameter.</p>

            <p>We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</p>

            <p>We study quantum quench of finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder on it. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law decay with decreasing quench rate, consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By contrast, the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of excitation density, namely larger excitation density at slower quench, is observed in disordered Kane-Mele model, which we attribute to the existence of a disorder-induced gapless region. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution. The difference of onsite occupation between the time-evolved state and instantaneous ground state at the end of the quench exhibits similar dependence on the quench rate as the excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models. This similarity still holds in the bulk of the system even when we consider realistic open boundary conditions, facilitating the experimental characterization of the dynamic features in these models.</p>

            <p>We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Armin Aminimajd, Joao Maia, Abhinendra Singh</p>
            <p>The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.</p>

            <p>Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</p>

We compare different linear algebra backends, e.g., NumPy versus the PyTorch, JAX, or TensorFlow libraries, as well as a mixed-precision-inspired approach and optimizations for the target hardware. Quantum Red TEA out of the Quantum TEA library specifically addresses handling tensors with different libraries or hardware, where the tensors are the building blocks of tensor network algorithms. The benchmark problem is a variational search of a ground state in an interacting model. This is a ubiquitous problem in quantum many-body physics, which we solve using tensor network methods. This approximate state-of-the-art method compresses quantum correlations which is key to overcoming the exponential growth of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of particles. We present a way to obtain speedups of a factor of 34 when tuning parameters on the CPU, and an additional factor of 2.76 on top of the best CPU setup when migrating to GPUs.</p>

            <p>Understanding neural representations will help open the black box of neural networks and advance our scientific understanding of modern AI systems. However, how complex, structured, and transferable representations emerge in modern neural networks has remained a mystery. Building on previous results, we propose the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (CRH), which posits a set of six alignment relations to universally govern the formation of representations in most hidden layers of a neural network. Under the CRH, the latent representations (R), weights (W), and neuron gradients (G) become mutually aligned during training. This alignment implies that neural networks naturally learn compact representations, where neurons and weights are invariant to task-irrelevant transformations. We then show that the breaking of CRH leads to the emergence of reciprocal power-law relations between R, W, and G, which we refer to as the Polynomial Alignment Hypothesis (PAH). We present a minimal-assumption theory proving that the balance between gradient noise and regularization is crucial for the emergence of the canonical representation. The CRH and PAH lead to an exciting possibility of unifying major key deep learning phenomena, including neural collapse and the neural feature ansatz, in a single framework.</p>

Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.</p>

            <p>Cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations are life-threatening hemodynamic pathologies of the brain. While surgical intervention is often essential to prevent fatal outcomes, it carries significant risks both during the procedure and in the postoperative period, making the management of these conditions highly challenging. Parameters of cerebral blood flow, routinely monitored during medical interventions or with modern noninvasive high-resolution imaging methods, could potentially be utilized in machine learning-assisted protocols for risk assessment and therapeutic prognosis. To this end, we developed a linear oscillatory model of blood velocity and pressure for clinical data acquired from neurosurgical operations. Using the method of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the parameters of our model can be reconstructed online within milliseconds from a short time series of the hemodynamic variables. The identified parameter values enable automated classification of the blood-flow pathologies by means of logistic regression, achieving an accuracy of 73 \%}. Our results demonstrate the potential of this model for both diagnostic and prognostic applications, providing a robust and interpretable framework for assessing cerebral blood vessel conditions.</p>

            <h2>Toolkit for General 2d Scalar Potential in LCT</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Emanuel Katz, Yuan Xin</p>
            <p>We present efficient algorithms for obtaining the Hamiltonian in Lightcone Conformal Truncation (LCT) for a 2d scalar field with a generic potential. We apply this method to the sine-Gordon and sinh-Gordon models in $1+1d$, and find precise agreement with integrability results when the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the deforming cosine/cosinh potential is in the range $ \Delta \leq 1$. The agreement provides additional evidence for a recent conjecture for how to compute the effective lightcone Hamiltonian in this class of models. In addition, to high precision, we provide the first direct confirmation for the conjectured self-duality of the sinh-Gordon model ($\Delta < 0)$, which relates $\Delta \leftrightarrow 4/\Delta$. As the dimension approaches the upper limit $\Delta=1$ from below, we show analytically that the Hamiltonian matrix elements exactly reproduce those of a free Majorana fermion, demonstrating how bosonization is manifested in the LCT basis. We comment on the possible extension of the approach to $\Delta > 1$.</p>

            <h2>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Zwicker, Oliver W. Paulin, Cathelijne ter Burg</p>
            <p>Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situations inside cells. This review discusses three general aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets posses complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</p>

            <h2>Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs): Combining Accuracy and Interpretability in Data-Driven Material Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kian P. Abdolazizi, Roland C. Aydin, Christian J. Cyron, Kevin Linka</p>
            <p>Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may not capture complex behaviors with the same accuracy. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help to overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.</p>

            <h2>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone, Kostya Trachenko</p>
            <p>There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</p>

            <p>Atomic-scale defects behaving as two-level systems (TLSs) are crucial to the physics of modern quantum devices. Here, we study interactions between individual TLS defects and the mechanical vibrations of a nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonator. By applying a mechanical strain, we tune individual TLS onto resonance with the NEMS and observe strong coupling. By adjusting phonon number, we reveal the nonlinear energy levels of the hybridized system and confirm single-phonon nonlinearity. We also observe fluctuations between hybridized and bare resonance states as the TLS fluctuates between on- and off-resonance. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from intrinsic material properties, without requiring external electromagnetic systems or complex quantum circuits. Our work establishes a platform for exploring and manipulating TLS-phonon interactions in the single-phonon regime.</p>

            <h2>Formation of Complex Discrete Time Crystals with Ultracold Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weronika Golletz, Krzysztof Sacha</p>
            <p>We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subrata Jana, Abhishek Bhattacharjee, Suman Mahakal, Szymon Smiga, Prasanjit Samal</p>
            <p>We propose a range-separated hybrid exchange-correlation functional to calculate solid-state material properties. The functional mixes Hartree-Fock exchange with the semilocal exchange of the meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) and the fraction of Hartree-Fock exchange is determined from the dielectric function. First-principles calculations and comparison with other meta-GGA approximations show that the functional leads to reasonably good performance for the band gap and optical properties. We also show that the present functional also successfully resolves the well-known ``band gap problem'' of narrow gap Cu-based semiconductors, such as Cu3SbSe4 and Cu3AsSe4, where, in general, a considerably large band inversion energy leads to a ``false'' negative or metallic band gap for all other methods. Furthermore, reasonable accuracy for the occupied d-bands and transition energies is also obtained for bulk solids. Thus, overall, our results demonstrate the predictive power of range-separated meta-GGA hybrid functionals for quantum materials simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Hao Cui, Andrew J. Millis, David R. Reichman</p>
            <p>CrSBr is a layered van der Waals insulator with a quasi one-dimensional electronic structure and in-plane ferromagnetic order. Recent experimental work on Li-doped CrSBr reveals quasi-1D charge modulated states. In this study, we develop ab initio effective models for CrSBr to investigate these states and solve them using mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory. The models are parametrized using density functional theory, the constrained random phase approximation, and the Rytova-Keldysh form of the long-range Coulomb interaction. Our simulations indicate the emergence of a charge density wave state characterized by cosine-like intra-chain density modulations and inter-chain phase shifts that minimize the Coulomb repulsion. Notably, at a doping level corresponding to $1/n$ electron per CrSBr unit, the most stable pattern exhibits a periodicity of $n$ cells, in agreement with experimental observations and Peierls' instability arguments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inter-chain order is sensitive to the range of Coulomb interactions. If the interaction is hard-truncated to a short-ranged form, some localized stripe-like states are computationally favored. This work provides an ab initio framework for understanding the interplay of competing electronic and magnetic phases in CrSBr and related materials.</p>

            <p>Two single crystal phases of tantalum nitride were stabilized on c-plane sapphire using molecular beam epitaxy. The phases were identified to be $\delta$-TaN with a rocksalt cubic structure and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N with a hexagonal structure. Atomic force microscopy scans revealed smooth surfaces for both the films with root mean square roughnesses less than 0.3 nm. Phase-purity of these films was determined by x-ray diffraction. Raman spectrum of the phase-pure $\delta$-TaN and $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N obtained will serve as a future reference to determine phase-purity of tantalum nitride films. Further, the room-temperature and low-temperature electronic transport measurements indicated that both of these phases are metallic at room temperature with resistivities of 586.2 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 75.5 $\mu\Omega$-cm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film and become superconducting below 3.6 K and 0.48 K respectively. The superconducting transition temperature reduces with applied magnetic field as expected. Ginzburg-Landau fitting revealed a 0 K critical magnetic field and coherence length of 18 T and 4.2 nm for the 30 nm $\delta$-TaN film and 96 mT and 59 nm for the 38 nm $\gamma$-Ta$_2$N film. These tantalum nitride films are of high interest for superconducting resonators and qubits.</p>

            <p>Spin-phonon interactions in 2D magnetic materials are crucial in advancing next-generation spintronic devices. Therefore, identifying new materials with significant spin-phonon interactions is of great importance. In this context, MnSe, previously recognized as an exemplary non-layered p-type semiconductor emerges in this study as an intriguing material with notable spin-phonon characteristics. The complex magnetism in pristine MnSe, primarily dominated by antiferromagnetism with a weak ferromagnetic component, gives rise to both spontaneous and conventional exchange bias effects at low temperatures. In an effort to understand this intriguing magnetism, we conducted a detailed Raman spectroscopy study, which reveals unconventional deviations from the usual phonon anharmonicity around Neel temperature (170 K), in the self-energies of the P1, P2, and P3 modes. Notably, the P1 mode is most sensitive to spin-phonon coupling, while the P2 mode is particularly responsive to the structural phase transition at 250 K. Therefore, these findings provide comprehensive insights into the phase transitions of pristine MnSe, particularly highlighting the previously unobserved interplay between its magnetic behavior and phonon dynamics.</p>

Two-dimensional (2D) topological phonons emerge as promising candidates for future technological applications.

Here, we report experimental evidence of topological phonons in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride using advanced high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy. Our high-precision measurements explicitly demonstrate two topological nodal rings in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, protected by mirror symmetry, expanding the paradigm of 2D topological phonons beyond graphene. This research not only deepens fundamental understanding of 2D topological phonons, but also establishes a phononic device platform based on wide-bandgap insulators, crucial for advancements in electronics and photonics applications.</p>

            <h2>Nested Shadows of Anyons:A Framework for Identifying Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun-Tak Oh, Hyun-Yong Lee</p>
            <p>The 1-form symmetries in two-dimensional topological systems are ``shadowed'' as global symmetries in their one-dimensional quantum transfer matrices. In this work, we introduce a distinct shadow effect arising from the pair-creation of anyons, which manifests as a local symmetry of the quantum transfer matrix. The interplay between these two shadow effects provides a powerful framework for characterizing topological phases without extensive numerical simulations. Specifically, we derive the phase diagram of the filtered toric code state and precisely identify phase boundaries using the nested shadows of anyons. Additionally, we reveal that a class of topological states host gapless edge modes protected by 1-form symmetry rather than global symmetry. Finally, we apply our approach to the three-dimensional toric code and X-cube states, uncovering a nontrivial path in phase space that connects them through a subdimensional critical point, which is highly challenging to detect numerically due to the complexity of simulating three-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>Graphene nanomechanical resonators are well suited for the study of parametric oscillations. Their large frequency tunability and their pronounced nonlinearities enable an efficient modulation of their resonant frequency. Here, we present measurements of the response of a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator driven by a large parametric pump at frequency $2\omega$ and a weak external drive at $\omega$, where $\omega$ is set near the mechanical resonant frequency $\omega_0$. The pump actuates the resonator beyond the threshold for large-amplitude parametric oscillations, while the drive breaks the symmetry of the parametric phase states. By increasing and decreasing a gate voltage to detune $\omega_0$ in the presence of the pump and the drive, we observe a double hysteresis in the response. The double hysteresis reveals the existence of two possible large-amplitude vibrational states whose phase difference is nearly $\pi$ radians. We deterministically prepare the resonator in either one of these states by cycling the gate voltage. We measure the stationary occupation probabilities of the two states in the presence of a white Gaussian force noise, and find that they strongly depend on the amplitude and on the phase of the external drive. Parametric oscillations with broken phase symmetry hold promise as units of binary information. Their phase states can be mapped to biased bi-modal degrees of freedom, such as Ising spins in an external magnetic field. Our work invites future studies on coupled graphene parametric resonators whose phase states may be mapped to a system of Ising spins.</p>

By overcoming the limitations of traditional two-angle methods, the widget significantly enhances the accuracy of structural and orientational analysis.

            <p>The complex gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance in quantum point contacts, shaped by entangled-state tunneling, was demonstrated through the movement of a localized spin. This spin responds to variations in side gate voltage, triggering a quantum phase transition (QPT) between symmetric and asymmetric Kondo coupling states, with the states separated by conductance regions $G \geq 0.7 G_0$ and $G \leq 0.7 G_0$, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, respectively. The asymmetric state has two Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The presence of two Kondo temperatures in the asymmetric state clarifies previously unresolved issues, such as the indeterminate Kondo temperature and anomalous behavior in the width of the zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) in the $G \leq 0.7 G_0$ region. The QPT was investigated by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent ZBA energy, calculated using the corresponding local density of states at the site of the localized spin, obtained during the replication of the differential conductance.</p>

            <p>Creating superior lanthanide-activated inorganic phosphors is pivotal for advancing energy-efficient LED lighting and backlit flat panel displays. The most fundamental property these luminescent materials must possess is effective absorption/excitation by a blue InGaN LED for practical conversion into white light. The 5$d_1$ excited state energy level of lanthanides, which determines the excitation peak position, is influenced by the inorganic host structure, including the local environment, crystal structure, and composition, making it challenging to predict in advance. This study introduces a new extreme gradient boosting machine learning method that quantitatively determines a phosphor's longest (lowest energy) excitation wavelength. We focus on the Ce$^{3+}$ 4$f$ $\rightarrow$ 5$d$ transition due to its well-defined 5$d_1$ energy level observed in excitation and diffuse reflectance spectra. The model was trained on experimental data for 357 Ce$^{3+}$ cation substitution sites sourced from literature and in-house measurements and ultimately experimentally validated through the successful synthesis of a novel, blue-excited, green-emitting phosphor: Ca$_2$SrSc$_6$O$_{12}$:Ce$^{3+}$. This compound's excitation under commercial blue LED wavelength aligned remarkably well with the model's predictions. These results highlight the transformative potential of data-driven approaches in expediting the discovery of blue-absorbing phosphors for next-generation LED lighting.</p>

            <p>Piezoelectric materials play a vital role in energy harvesting, piezotronics and various self-powered sensing applications. The piezoelectric strength of 2D materials is limited by the carrier charge screening, leading to reduced open circuit voltages and poor piezotronic performances. Reducing the carrier screening in devices is a key requirement to fully utilize the potential of 2D materials for piezoelectric applications. In this work, we demonstrate that lateral heterojunction devices offer an excellent way to improve the piezoelectric open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. Because of the asymmetric contacts with Nickel (Ni) electrodes, the heterojunctions of monolayer(1L) MoS_2 and MoTe_2 form a hybrid Schottky/p-n diode. We demonstrate a rectification ratio of more than 5000 without electrostatic gating. We observed that devices with higher junction potentials exhibit piezoelectric open-circuit voltages exceeding 1V and a peak power density of 690 mW/m^2. The output characteristics reveal a trade-off between open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. These findings and the role of built-in (cut-in) voltages in energy harvesting provide valuable insights for the design of piezotronic junctions to achieve high piezoelectric output and/or rectification ratios. Design aspects of heterojunctions discussed in this manuscript can be applied to other emerging nanomaterials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mahnaz Rezaei, Jahanfar Abouie, Fariba Nazari</p>
            <p>MN4-embedded graphene (MN4-G) layers, with transition metal elements M, are experimentally accessible two-dimensional (2D) materials and show great potential for stable nanoscale magnetization. In these materials, the exchange couplings between magnetic atoms are predominantly governed by Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling, exhibiting an unusual prolonged decay of r to the power of minus n, where r is the M-M separation distance, and n is between 0.5 and 2. In this paper, we explore the effects of induced strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of MN4-G layers through ab-initio density functional theory. We employ a specific method to apply strain by positioning atoms from one layer within the equilibrium structure of another layer, thereby inducing strain in the form of either tension or compression. The induced strain results in an approximate plus/minus 0.4% variation in the unit-cell area of the MN4-G lattice. Our findings reveal that while the exchange coupling mechanism remains unaffected, the strength, amplitude, and decay rate of the RKKY coupling are significantly influenced by the induced strain. Notably, the CoN4-G layer exhibits a remarkable increase in the strength and oscillation amplitude of the RKKY coupling, along with a reduced decay rate. Additionally, the electronic and magnetic properties of the CuN4-G layers remain unchanged under induced strain.</p>

Recent theoretical studies have revealed gain-loss-induced topological disclination states, along with the associated fractional charge trapped at the disclination sites.

By designing alternating lossy electric circuit networks that correspond to the disclination lattice, we observe a voltage response localized at the disclination sites and demonstrate the robustness of these states against disorder. Furthermore, we measure the charge distribution, confirming the presence of fractional charge at the disclination sites, which gives rise to the topological disclination states. Our experiment provides direct evidence of gain-loss-induced topological disclination states in electric circuits, opening new possibilities for applications in classical systems.</p>

            <p>This study presents a novel method for fabricating stoichiometric SnS thin films with large grain sizes via reactive sputtering using a metallic Sn target and sulfur plasma (S-plasma). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on toxic H2S gas, this method employs a S-plasma to enhance sulfur reactivity and mitigate sulfur deficiencies during film deposition. By optimizing the balance between the sputtering conditions of the Sn target and the supply conditions of the S-plasma, dense single-phase SnS thin films with micron-scale grain sizes were achieved at a substrate temperature of 300 degree C, achieving an in-plane Hall mobility of 13 cm2 V-1 s-1. Furthermore, crystalline SnS thin films were fabricated even on a room-temperature substrate, enabling potential applications in flexible devices with heat-sensitive substrates. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of S-plasma in advancing SnS thin film fabrication, providing a safer and more efficient route to high-performance photovoltaic materials.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic resonance in a bulk $\alpha$-MnTe crystal is investigated using both frequency-domain and time-domain THz spectroscopy techniques. At low temperatures, an excitation at the photon energy of 3.5 meV is observed and identified as a magnon mode through its distinctive dependence on temperature and magnetic field. This behavior is reproduced using a simplified model for antiferromagnetic resonance in an easy-plane antiferromagnet, enabling the extraction of the out-of-plane component of the single-ion magnetic anisotropy reaching (40 $\pm$ 10) $\mu$eV.</p>

            <p>TaRhTe$_4$ is a type-IIWeyl semimetal, exhibiting fourWeyl points in proximity to the Fermi level. In this article, we report our results of a systematic study of longitudinal magnetoresistance in TaRhTe$_4$. Our findings indicate that magnetoresistance becomes negative only when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric field. By rotating E (as well as B), we show that its origin is consistent with the prediction of the chiral anomaly, while the current jetting effect and weak localization could be excluded. The negative magnetoresistance persists up to room temperature, suggesting that TaRhTe4 exhibits distinctive properties within the family of Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p>To understand the complex interplay of topography and surface chemistry in wetting, fundamental studies investigating both parameters are needed. Due to the sensitivity of wetting to miniscule changes in one of the parameters it is imperative to precisely control the experimental approach. A profound understanding of their influence on wetting facilitates a tailored design of surfaces with unique functionality. We present a multi-step study: The influence of surface chemistry is analyzed by determining the adsorption of volatile carbonous species (A) and by sputter deposition of metallic copper and copper oxides on flat copper substrates (B). A precise surface topography is created by laser processing. Isotropic topography is created by ps laser processing (C), and hierarchical anisotropic line patterns are produced by direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) with different pulse durations (D). Our results reveal that the long-term wetting response of polished copper surfaces stabilizes with time despite ongoing accumulation of hydrocarbons and is dominated by this adsorption layer over the oxide state of the substrate (Cu, CuO, Cu2O). The surfaces' wetting response can be precisely tuned by tailoring the topography via laser processing. The sub-pattern morphology of primary line-like patterns showed great impact on the static contact angle, wetting anisotropy, and water adhesion. An increased roughness inside the pattern valleys combined with a minor roughness on the peaks favors air-inclusions, isotropic hydrophobicity, and low water adhesion. Increasing the aspect ratio showed to enhance air-inclusions and hydrophobicity despite increased peak roughness while time dependent wetting transitions were observed.</p>

            <p>Electrical transport of oxide films under high pressure is largely unexplored due to the absence of a universal strategy. In this work, we have developed an in-house route to investigate the electrical transport properties of oxide films under high pressures, by improving the elasticity of freestanding oxide films and the robustness of high-pressure techniques on nano-devices. As a showcase, we investigated the electrical resistivity of perovskite SrIrO3 films under high pressures, and found a pressure-driven semimetal-to-insulator transition and an insulator-to-metal transition. At the monolayer-limit, the SrIrO3 films directly transform from an insulating state to a metallic state, highlighting the intriguing interplay of dimensionality and hydrostatic pressure in correlated oxides, which can be unveiled through the universal high-pressure strategy.</p>

            <p>The advancement of semiconductor materials has played a crucial role in the development of electronic and optical devices. However, scaling down semiconductor devices to the nanoscale has imposed limitations on device properties due to quantum effects. Hence, the search for successor materials has become a central focus in the fields of materials science and physics. Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are extraordinary materials known for their outstanding stability, biocompatibility, and ability to integrate with semiconductors. Over the past few decades, TMNs have been extensively employed in various fields. However, the synthesis of single-crystal TMNs has long been challenging, hindering the advancement of their high-performance electronics and plasmonics. Fortunately, progress in film deposition techniques has enabled the successful epitaxial growth of high-quality TMN films. In comparison to reported reviews, there is a scarcity of reviews on epitaxial TMN films from the perspective of materials physics and condensed matter physics, particularly at the atomic level. Therefore, this review aims to provide a brief summary of recent progress in epitaxial growth at atomic precision, emergent physical properties (superconductivity, magnetism, ferroelectricity, and plasmon), and advanced electronic and plasmonic devices associated with epitaxial TMN films.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Deepanshu Aggarwal, Rohit Narula, Sankalpa Ghosh</p>
            <p>Supermoiré structures (SMS), formed by overlapping moiré-patterns in van der Waals heterostructures, display complex behaviour that lacks a comprehensive low-energy theoretical description. We demonstrate that these structures can form emergent fractals under specific conditions and identify the parameter space where this occurs in hexagonal trilateral SMS. This fractality enables a reliable calculation of low-energy band counts, which are crucial for understanding both single-particle and correlation effects. Using an effective Hamiltonian that includes in- and out-of-plane lattice relaxation, we analyze SMS in hBN-encapsulated single and bilayer graphene. We prescribe methods to experimentally verify these fractals and extract their fractal dimension through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. B. Swain, J. Kuttruff, J. Vorberger, P. Baum</p>
            <p>Electron-hole pairs in semiconductors are essential for solar cells and fast electronic circuitry, but the competition between carrier transport and relaxation into heat limits the efficiency and speed. Here we use ultrafast electron diffraction with terahertz pulse compression to measure the electron-phonon decay rate in single-crystal silicon as a function of laser excitation strength. We find that the excited electrons relax slower into phonons for higher carrier densities. The electron-phonon scattering rate changes in a nonlinear way from 400 fs at ~$2 \times 10^{20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$ to 1.2 ps at ~$4 \times 10^{20} \text{ cm}^{-3}$. These results indicate that a hot electron gas quenches the scattering into phonons in a temperature-dependent way. Ultrafast electronic circuitry of silicon therefore should work faster and provide higher bandwidths at lower carrier densities.</p>

            <p>Designing the high performance magneto or elastocaloric effect in NiMnIn alloys with spin-lattice coupling in a deep freezing temperature range of 200 K to 255 K is challenging due to the limited lattice entropy change and large negative contribution of magnetic entropy change during phase transitions. In this work, we systematically study the first order magneto-structural transition in NiMnIn based alloys by in-situ microstructural characterizations, physical property measurements, and first principles calculations. A multi element alloying strategy involving Cu and Ga co doping is proposed to manipulate the phase transition. The co doping reduces the lattice anharmonicity and thermal expansion coefficient of the martensitic phase, leading to an increase in the unit cell volume change and lattice entropy change. It also modifies the electronic density of states, causing a decrease in the magnetization change .The relief of the lattice mismatch reduces hysteresis losses in the refrigeration cycle. These synergetic effects yield excellent magneto and elastocaloric effects,with the effective magnetocaloric refrigeration capacity reaching up to 182 J/kg under the magnetic field of 5 T or an adiabatic temperature change of -4 K under a low field of 1.5 T and the elastocaloric coefficient of performance to 30 or an adiabatic temperature change of -7 K with the strain of 5% at 230 K, offering a potential solution for solid-state deep-freezing refrigeration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ce Zhang, Heng Lu, Chen Yang, YuBin Zhang, FengNan Chen, Ying Yan, Joel Moser</p>
            <p>Nanomechanical resonators driven by multifrequency signals combine the physics of mesoscopic vibrations and the technologies of radio communication. Their simplest property stems from their resonant response: they behave as filters, responding only to driving signals whose frequency range is contained within that of the mechanical response. While the response is routinely probed with a single tone drive, a multifrequency drive offers the possibility of inducing richer vibrational dynamics. In this case, all the frequency components of the drive are simultaneously transduced into vibrations with different amplitudes and phases that superimpose and interfere. Here, we employ a few-layer graphene nanomechanical resonator as a filter for broadband, digitally modulated video signals. We transduce the modulated drive into modulated vibrations, which we demodulate into a nanomechanical video. Our work reveals distinctive features in vibrations driven by a coherent, multifrequency drive unseen in vibrations actuated by single tone drives or by a force noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rinske M. Alkemade, Rastko Sknepnek, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion</p>
            <p>Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from e.g. depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid-colloid interaction and colloid-polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sheikh Moonsun Pervez, Saptarshi Mandal</p>
            <p>We perform a systematic and exact study of Majorana fermion dynamics in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ model in a few finite-size clusters increasing in size up to twelve sites. We employ exact Jordan-Wigner transformations to evaluate certain measures of Majorana fermion correlation functions, which effectively capture matter and gauge Majorana fermion dynamics in different parameter regimes. An external magnetic field is shown to produce a profound effect on gauge fermion dynamics. Depending on certain non-zero choices of other non-Kitaev interactions, it can stabilise it to its non-interacting Kitaev limit. For all the parameter regimes, gauge fermions are seen to have slower dynamics, which could help build approximate decoupling schemes for appropriate mean-field theory. The probability of Majorana fermions returning to their original starting site shows that the Kitaev model in small clusters can be used as a test bed for the quantum speed limit.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fraser Birks, Thomas D Swinburne, James R Kermode</p>
            <p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near first-principles accuracy but are computationally expensive, limiting their application in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an 'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.</p>

            <p>Organic electrode-active materials (OAMs) not only enable a variety of charge and storage mechanisms, but are also safer for the environment and of lower cost compared to materials in commonly used lithium-ion batteries. Cross-linked Poly(3)-vinyl-N-methylphenothiazine (X-PVMPT) is a p-type OAM which shows high performance and enables fast and reversible energy storage in different battery configurations. The performance of an OAM does not only depend on its molecular or polymer structure, but also on the structure of the composite electrode. The porous nanostructure of an electrode composed of X-PVMPT, a conductive carbon additive and binder is investigated by statistical image analysis, based on 3D image data obtained by focused-ion beam scanning-electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) measurements. Univariate probability distributions of relevant morphological descriptors as well as bivariate distributions of pairs of such descriptors are parametrically modelled, among others, by utilization of copulas in the latter case. These models are then used for quantifying local heterogeneities of X-PVMPT considered in this paper. Furthermore, it is shown that the nanostructure changes when traversing from bottom to top face of the electrode, which influences its performance. While the observed short transportation paths trough the solid phase are beneficial in terms of electrical conductivity, the pathways through the pore phase influencing the effective ionic diffusivity are--in comparison--rather long.</p>

            <p>Based on bond percolation theory, a method is presented here to calculate the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation in porous media from first principles. The governing equations are formulated on the undirected graph of the pore network. The graph is a simplified mathematical object that accounts for the topology of the pore structure. Thus, the calculation is extremely computationally efficient since it is mesh-free and voxel-free. Two topological invariants are identified: The bond percolation threshold and the residual saturation. Bond percolation theory is used to obtain a closed-form pressure-saturation relation in terms of the geometry of the pores (pore throat distribution) and material parameters (contact angle and interfacial tension), universal exponents, and topological invariants, based on scaling relations.</p>

We observed a clear relationship between the annealing temperature and the parameters of magnetic property. The most significant changes of both the magnetic anisotropy and the magnetoelastic properties were correlated with the appearance of the L21 ordered phase, suggesting that the emergence of magnetic Weyl semimetallic feature is the key point to vary these magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>Self-assembled GaN nanowires are typically grown on Si substrates with convenient nucleation layers. Light-emitting devices based on arrays of GaN nanowires require that the nucleation layer is electrically conductive and optically nontransparent to prevent the absorption of generated light in the Si substrate. This study reports the molecular beam epitaxial growth of GaN nanowires on ZrN nucleation layers sputtered on sapphire and demonstrates that ZrN provides ohmic contact to dense vertical arrays of n-type GaN nanowires. The ohmic nature of the ZrN/n-type GaN nanowire contact is evidenced by the measurement of the current-voltage characteristics of individual as-grown nanowires using nanomanipulators in a scanning electron microscope. The limitations and advantages of single-nanowire measurements are discussed, and approaches to overcome these limitations are proposed. The feasibility of this concept is demonstrated by the measurement of single nanowire with a p-n junction, exhibiting highly rectifying characteristics.</p>

            <p>Inferring viscoelasticity parameters is a key challenge that often leads to non-unique solutions when fitting rheological data. In this context, we propose a machine learning approach that utilizes Bayesian optimization for parameter inference during curve-fitting processes. To fit a viscoelastic model to rheological data, the Bayesian optimization maps the parameter values to a given error function. It then exploits the mapped space to identify parameter combinations that minimize the error. We compare the Bayesian optimization results to traditional fitting routines and demonstrate that our approach finds the fitting parameters in a less or similar number of iterations. Furthermore, it also creates a "white-box" and supervised framework for parameter estimation in linear viscoelasticity modeling.</p>

            <p>Most Mn-rich cathodes are known to undergo phase transformation into structures resembling spinel-like ordering upon electrochemical cycling. Recently, the irreversible transformation of Ti-containing Mn-rich disordered rock-salt cathodes into a phase -- named $\delta$ -- with nanoscale spinel-like domains has been shown to increase energy density, capacity retention, and rate capability. However, the nature of the boundaries between domains and their relationship with composition and electrochemistry are not well understood. In this work, we discuss how the transformation into the multi-domain structure results in eight variants of Spinel domains, which is crucial for explaining the nanoscale domain formation in the $\delta$-phase. We study the energetics of crystallographically unique boundaries and the possibility of Li-percolation across them with a fine-tuned CHGNet machine learning interatomic potential. Energetics of $16d$ vacancies reveal a strong affinity to segregate to the boundaries, thereby opening Li-pathways at the boundary to enhance long-range Li-percolation in the $\delta$ structure. Defect calculations of the relatively low-mobility Ti show how it can influence the extent of Spinel ordering, domain morphology and size significantly; leading to guidelines for engineering electrochemical performance through changes in composition.</p>

            <p>We propose using altermagnetic phases as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators. The transmutation of pure into mixed altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and the concomitant development of an anomalous Hall response can be associated with the breaking of specific lattice symmetries by external fields or the development of subleading order parameters. We introduce the basic ideas in the context of RuO$_2$ and discuss the case of surface magnetism in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Our study suggests that if Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ hosts a pure altermagnet on its surface, the onset of specific superconducting states could transmute this altermagnet from pure to mixed and account for the apparent onset of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) at the superconducting transition temperature, without necessarily ascribing TRSB to the superconducting state. Further investigation of this unusual scenario could provide essential steps toward a more coherent picture of the phenomenology of this material.</p>

            <p>Soft machines display shape adaptation to external circumstances due to their intrinsic compliance. To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Efficiency in Shear-Loaded Brownian Gyrators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Iman Abdoli, Abhinav Sharma, Hartmut Löwen</p>
            <p>A Brownian gyrator is a system in which a particle experiences thermal noise from two distinct heat baths. This nonequilibrium setup inherently generates a nonzero torque, leading to gyrating motion around a potential energy minimum. As a minimal model for a heat engine, the Brownian gyrator provides valuable insights into energy conversion and nonequilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the effect of an externally imposed shear flow on a Brownian gyrator, treating it as a mechanical load. The shear flow introduces a tunable mechanism that allows the system to operate either as a heat engine, extracting work from the temperature gradient, or as a refrigerator, transferring heat from the colder to the hotter bath. Focusing on the heat engine regime, we analytically derive the steady-state probability distribution to compute the average torque exerted by the gyrator and quantify the mechanical power extracted from the shear. Our results show a remarkable increase in efficiency compared to the standard Brownian gyrator without shear, approaching Carnot efficiency at maximum power. Surprisingly, we also find that while the system can operate efficiently as a heat engine, it may become unstable before reaching the stall condition, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and stability in shear-driven microscopic engines.</p>

Recently, the hexaaluminates \textit{R}MgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ (\textit{R} = rare earth) have been proposed to be a platform for realizing the quantum spin liquid state with dominant Ising anisotropic correlations. Here, we report detailed low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation, and thermodynamic studies on the CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ single crystal. Ising anisotropy is revealed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. Muon spin relaxation and ac susceptibility measurements rule out any long-range magnetic ordering or spin freezing down to 50 mK despite the onset of spin correlations below $\sim$0.8 K. Instead, the spins keep fluctuating at a rate of 1.0(2) MHz at 50 mK. Specific heat results indicate a gapless excitation with a power-law dependence on temperature, $C_m(T) \propto T^{\alpha}$. The quasi-quadratic temperature dependence with $\alpha$ = 2.28(4) in zero field and linear temperature dependence in 0.25 T support the possible realization of the U(1) Dirac quantum spin liquid state.</p>

            <h2>Majorana sweet spots in 3-site Kitaev chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo A. Dourado, Martin Leijnse, Rubén Seoane Souto</p>
            <p>Minimal Kitaev chains, composed of two quantum dots (QDs) connected via a superconductor, have emerged as an attractive platform to realize Majorana bound states (MBSs). These excitations exist when the ground state is degenerate. The additional requirement of isolating the MBS wavefunctions further restricts the parameter space to discrete sweet spots. While scaling up to Kitaev chains with more than two sites has the potential to improve the stability of the MBSs, longer chains offer more features to optimize, including the MBS localization length and the excitation gap. In this work, we theoretically investigate 3-site Kitaev chains and show that there are three different types of sweet spots, obtained by maximizing distinct MBS properties: genuine 3-site sweet spots with well-localized MBSs at the ends, effective 2-site sweet spots, where the middle site acts as a barrier, and sweet spots with delocalized MBSs that overlap in the middle of the chain. These three cases feature different degrees of robustness against perturbations, with the genuine 3-site being the most stable. We analyze the energy spectrum, transport, and microwave absorption associated with these three cases, showing how to distinguish them.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a recently proposed and experimentally confirmed class of magnetic order, features collinear compensated magnetism with unconventional d-, g-, or i-wave spin order. Here, we show that in a metallic 2D d-wave altermagnet with combined two-fold spin and four-fold lattice rotational symmetry $[C_2||C_4]$, secondary instabilities can arise. Using an unbiased functional renormalization group approach, we analyze the weak-coupling instabilities of a 2D Hubbard model with a preexisting altermagnetic order inspired by our ab initio electronic structure calculations of realistic material candidates from V$_2$X$_2$O (X = Te, Se) family. We identify two distinct spin density wave (SDW) states that break the underlying altermagnetic $[C_2||C_4]$ symmetry. Additionally, we find spin-fluctuation-induced instabilities leading to a singlet d-wave superconducting state and an unconventional commensurate pair density wave (PDW) state with extended s-wave and spin-triplet symmetry. We establish a general criterion for the unusual exchange statistics for these pair density waves and characterize their excitation spectrum, which exhibits Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces or nodal points depending on the gap size.</p>

            <h2>Time-Reversal Mirror inside a granular suspension: a way of measuring the ultrasound diffusion coefficient</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Abraham, B. A. van Tiggelen, N. Benech, C. Negreira, X. Jia, A. Tourin</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient, $D$, for ultrasound propagating in a multiple scattering medium, such as a dense granular suspension, can be measured using a time reversal experiment. This requires an unprecedented experimental setup in which a piezoelectric transducer, acting as a Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM), is embedded within the granular suspension at a depth much larger than the scattering mean free path, while an array of transducers is placed in the far field of the scattering sample. A single element of the array emits a short pulse and the TRM records the resulting ultrasonic field, which consists of a ballistic coherent wave followed by a coda wave. When the entire coda wave is time-reversed and re-emitted from the TRM, it is observed to refocus on the original source, with a focal spot size that decreases with the inverse depth of the TRM, characteristic of a diffusive regime. Time-reversal of short windows selected at different times $t$ in the coda wave reveals a focal spot size that decreases as the inverse square root of time, i.e., $1 / \sqrt{Dt}$. By fitting the predictions of a microscopic diffusion theory to our experimental data, we are able to accurately measure the diffusion coefficient in the granular suspension. Remarkably, this method does not require ensemble averaging due to stability of time-reversal against statistical fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in condensed matter physics. Moiré materials featuring flat bands provide a versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In moiré materials that break either time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4$^\circ$ twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB-AB, AB-BA) and forms an inversion broken \moire superlattice with electrically tunable flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the perpendicular electric field in AB-AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity in AB-BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking-induced quantum geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and detection.</p>

            <p>Recently discovered phase of collinear magnet called, altermagnet breaks time reversal symmetry (TRS), exhibits momentum-dependent spin-splitting of band structure with zero net magnetization. In this work, we theoretically investigate the Josephson junction (JJ) of spin singlet superconductor (SC)/altermagnet/spin triplet SC and demonstrate that it manifests field free Josephson diode effect (JDE). We illustrate that there are four key requisites to have JDE in such JJs, namely, broken TRS, left and right SC in the JJ shall be non-identical, presence of spin orbit interaction, and anisotropy in spin polarization at the Fermi surface or anisotropy in pair potential of the SC. It has also been shown that by applying a gate potential in the altermagnetic regime, one can not only reverse the sign of efficiency but also modulate its magnitude. Our system can be used as a superconducting rectifier that can be tuned efficiently using gate voltage and system parameters without having external magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>How to choose efficiently the size of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation Hamiltonian for accurate exciton calculations on supercells</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafael R. Del Grande, David A. Strubbe</p>
            <p>The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is the workhorse method to study excitons in materials. The size of the BSE Hamiltonian, that is how many valence to conduction band transitions are considered in those calculations, needs to be chosen to be sufficiently large to converge excitons' energies and wavefunctions but should be minimized to make calculations tractable, as BSE calculations scale with the number of atoms as $ (N_{\rm{atoms}}^6)$. In particular, in the case of supercell (SC) calculations composed of $N_{\rm{rep}}$ replicas of the primitive cell (PC), a natural choice to build this BSE Hamiltonian is to include all transitions from PC calculations by zone folding. However, this greatly increases the size of the BSE Hamiltonian, as the number of matrix elements in it is $(N_k N_c N_v)^2$, where $N_k$ is the number of $k$-points, and $N_{c(v)}$ is the number of conduction (valence) states. The number of $k$-points decreases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}$ but both the number of conduction and valence states increase by the same factor, therefore the BSE Hamiltonian increases by a factor $N_{\rm{rep}}^2$, making exactly corresponding calculations prohibitive. Here we provide an analysis to decide how many transitions are necessary to achieve comparable results. With our method, we show that to converge with an energy tolerance of 0.1 eV the first exciton binding energy of a LiF SC composed of 64 PCs, we only need 12\% of the valence to conduction transitions that are given by zone folding. We also show that exciton energies are much harder to converge than Random Phase Approximation transition energies, underscoring the necessity of careful convergence studies. The procedure in our work helps in evaluating excitonic properties in large SC calculations such as defects, self-trapped excitons, polarons, and interfaces.</p>

            <p>Analyzing imaging and hyperspectral data is crucial across scientific fields, including biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The primary goal is to transform high-resolution or high-dimensional data into an interpretable format to generate actionable insights, aiding decision-making and advancing knowledge. Currently, this task relies on complex, human-designed workflows comprising iterative steps such as denoising, spatial sampling, keypoint detection, feature generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolutions. The introduction of machine learning over the past decade has accelerated tasks like image segmentation and object detection via supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction via unsupervised methods. However, both classical and NN-based approaches still require human input, whether for hyperparameter tuning, data labeling, or both. The growing use of automated imaging tools, from atomically resolved imaging to biological applications, demands unsupervised methods that optimize data representation for human decision-making or autonomous experimentation. Here, we discuss advances in reward-based workflows, which adopt expert decision-making principles and demonstrate strong transfer learning across diverse tasks. We represent image analysis as a decision-making process over possible operations and identify desiderata and their mappings to classical decision-making frameworks. Reward-driven workflows enable a shift from supervised, black-box models sensitive to distribution shifts to explainable, unsupervised, and robust optimization in image analysis. They can function as wrappers over classical and DCNN-based methods, making them applicable to both unsupervised and supervised workflows (e.g., classification, regression for structure-property mapping) across imaging and hyperspectral data.</p>

            <p>In this study, we innovatively modeled photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) devices, incorporating positive ion injection and bidirectional discharge's effects on the space charge barrier simultaneously. Compared to previous models, our model allows the positive ion distribution function to be compatible with scenarios in which the anode motive is either higher or lower than the cathode motive, and also adapts to significant anode discharge. Through numerical simulations and parametric analyses, we found that: (1) As the ratio of the positive ion increases, the capability for space charge neutralization becomes stronger. (2) The lower the electron affinity is, the smaller the ratio of positive ions are required. (3) When the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is lower, the impact of reverse discharge on the net current density is more pronounced. Conversely, when the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is greater, the ratio of positive ions required to achieve complete space charge neutralization increases. This study further elucidates the mechanisms and characteristics of space charge neutralization effects in PETE devices, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing their design. Additionally, the accompanying theory and algorithm possess the potential to spark innovative research across diverse fields.</p>

            <p>Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.</p>

            <p>This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</p>

            <p>A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</p>

            <h2>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin</p>
            <p>Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Though the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source to couple to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum engines.</p>

            <p>The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we develop algorithmic improvements for optimizing these wave-functions which includes compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications. We apply these improvements to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz finding that they lead to improved accuracy and scalability. Using these techniques, we find NNBF surpasses traditional methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperform existing NQS approaches, and achieve competitive energies compared to state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods such as HCI, ASCI, and FCIQMC. An ablation study highlights the contribution of each enhancement, showing significant gains in energy accuracy and computational efficiency. We also examine the dependence of NNBF expressiveness on the inverse participation ratio (IPR), observing that more delocalized states are generally harder to approximate.</p>

However, despite many efforts to improve SPAD's performance, the design of SPADs remained largely an iterative and time-consuming process where a designer makes educated guesses of a device structure based on empirical reasoning and solves the semiconductor drift-diffusion model for it. In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., directly inferring a structure needed to achieve desired performance, which is of ultimate interest to designers, remains an unsolved problem. We propose a novel physics-aware inverse design workflow for SPADs using a deep learning model and demonstrate it with an example of finding the key parameters of semiconductor nanowires constituting the unit cell of an SPAD, given target photon detection efficiency. Our inverse design workflow is not restricted to the case demonstrated and can be applied to design conventional planar structure-based SPADs, photodetectors, and solar cells.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover</p>
            <p>The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</p>

These codes are not applicable on current superconducting devices with nearest-neighbor connections. To rectify the deficiency in connectivity of superconducting circuit system, we experimentally demonstrate a convenient on-chip coupler of centimeters long and propose an extra coupler layer to map the qubit array to a binary-tree connecting graph. This mapping layout reduces the average qubit entangling distance from O(N) to O(logN), demonstrating an exponentially enhanced connectivity with eliminated crosstalk. The entangling gate with the coupler is performed between two fluxonium qubits, reaching a fidelity of 99.37 % while the system static ZZ rate remains as low as 144 Hz without active cancellation or circuit parameter targeting. With the scalable binary tree structure and high-fidelity non-local entanglement, novel quantum algorithms can be implemented on the superconducting qubit system, positioning it as a strong competitor to other physics systems regarding circuit connectivity.</p>

            <p>A spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) handles large-scale combinatorial optimization problems owing to optical processing with spatial parallelism. However, iterative feedback in the search for optimal solutions limits processing speed even though the Ising Hamiltonian is computed optically. We propose a parallel spatial photonic Ising machine (pSPIM) utilizing spatial multiplexing to search for an optimal solution efficiently. By employing grating patterns and encoding multiple sets of Ising spins in a phase distribution, several Ising Hamiltonians are computed simultaneously. We demonstrated that Max-Cut problems requiring 100 Ising spins are solved faster as the number of processing units increases. In addition, combining the multicomponent model with parallel processing allows for efficient searching for optimal solutions to problems represented by using interaction matrixes with a rank greater than one. The pSPIM achieves high-speed searching of optimal solutions of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</p>

Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</p>

            <p>The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</p>

            <p>Optical biosensors based on micro-/nano-fibers are highly valuable for probing and monitoring liquid environments and bioactivity. Most of current optical biosensors, however, are still based on glass, semiconductors, or metallic materials, which might be not fully suited for biologically-relevant environments. Here, we introduce biocompatible and flexible microfibers from Lotus silk as micro-environmental monitors that exhibit waveguiding of intrinsic fluorescence as well as of coupled light. These features make single-filament monitors excellent building blocks for a variety of sensing functions, including pH-probing and detection of bacterial activity. These results pave the way for the development of new and entirely eco-friendly, potentially multiplexed biosensing platforms.</p>

            <h2>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone, Kostya Trachenko</p>
            <p>There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. Currently, none of the known mathematical population-dynamic models can reproduce all these four types of functions as its solutions. This is of course a great impediment on the way towards forecasting trends in global population growth, which is an ever more urgent exercise in an era dominated by substantial climate and ecological threats. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Path integral spin dynamics with exchange and external field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Nussle, Stam Nicolis, Iason Sofos, Joseph Barker</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose a path integral-inspired formalism for computing the quantum thermal expectation values of spins, when subject to magnetic fields that can be time-dependent and can accommodate the presence of Heisenberg exchange interactions between the spins. This generalises the formalism presented in our previous work [Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043075 (2023)] and paves the way towards the realisation of large-scale atomistic simulations, for which this method should reveal its true efficiency gains, when compared to exact quantum methods. We compare our results with exact/numerical diagonalisation methods, where possible, to confirm the range of accuracy of our model.</p>
