            <h2>Photoluminescence from metal nanostructures -- dependence on size</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Imon Kalyan, Ieng Wai Un, Gilles Rosolen, Nir Shitrit, Yonatan Sivan</p>
            <p>For decades, there have been multiple seemingly contradicting experimental reports on the dependence of the photoluminescence from metal nanostructures on their size. We reconcile these reports using a simple analytic formula which is found to match well photoluminescence measurements for a range of structures and illumination conditions. Our expression requires only knowledge of the local electric field and temperature, and it points to the physical quantities that determine the emission strength and its dependence on size.</p>

            <h2>A method for determining the Zeeman splitting of a spin qubit via Rabi-driven tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Townsend, Joshua Pomeroy, Garnett W. Bryant</p>
            <p>We show that resonant driving between the spin up and spin down states of an electron spin-qubit in a quantum dot reduces the occupancy of the dot through leakage to an appropriately tuned lead. A nearby charge sensor measuring the occupancy of the dot should be able to detect the narrow resonant condition upon sweeping the driving frequency. The presence of interactions with noisy and thermal environments such as leads are an inherent part of creating and manipulating quantum information processing systems. This work is an example of how to incorporate methods from the ``open quantum systems'' perspective into descriptions of quantum devices. The method used here captures the coherent dynamics of the Rabi driving on the spin state of an electron tunneling into a lead, and yields full equations of motion for the interaction-picture density matrix with on- or off-resonance driving</p>

            <h2>Moiré Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lu Zhou, Zheng-Chun Li, Keye Zhang, Zhihao Lan, Alessio Celi, Weiping Zhang</p>
            <p>As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Additionally, we derive the cavity field spectrum, connected to the dynamical structure factor, and showcase controlled atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.</p>

            <h2>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Quade, Michael Potthoff</p>
            <p>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by $2\pi$ rotations of the phase $\phi$ of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces $\ca H_{0}(\phi)$ based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective $\sigma_{x}$-gate and a projective $\sigma_{z}$-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.</p>

            <h2>Imaging Odd-Parity Quasiparticle Interference in the Superconductive Surface State of UTe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuqiu Wang, Kuanysh Zhussupbekov, Joseph P. Carroll, Bin Hu, Xiaolong Liu, Emile Pangburn, Adeline Crepieux, Catherine Pepin, Christopher Broyles, Sheng Ran, Nicholas P. Butch, Shanta Saha, Johnpierre Paglione, Cristina Bena, J.C. Séamus Davis, Qiangqiang Gu</p>
            <p>Although no known material definitely exhibits intrinsic topological superconductivity, where a spin-triplet electron pairing potential $\Delta(k)$ has odd parity, UTe2 is now the leading candidate. Ideally, the parity of $\Delta(k)$ might be established by using Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging, a recognized technique for $\Delta(k)$ determination in complex superconductors. However, odd-parity superconductors should support a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) on crystal termination surfaces only for energies within the superconductive energy gap. The QPI should then be dominated by the QSB electronic structure and only reveal bulk $\Delta(k)$ characteristics excursively. Here, by using a superconducting scan-tip to achieve $\sim$ 10 $\mu$eV energy resolution QPI for UTe2 studies, we discover and visualize the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of its QSB. QPI visualization then yields a characteristic sextet $q_{i}:i$ = 1-6 of interference wavevectors from which we establish QSB dispersions, and their existence only for energies $|E| \leq \Delta_{\text{max}}$ within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. Quantitative evaluation of this sextet $q_{i}$ then demonstrates precisely how the QSB is projected from the subtending bulk Fermi surface. Finally, a novel theoretical framework has been developed to predict the QPI signatures of a topological QSB at this (0-11) surface. Its predictions are demonstrably consistent with the experimental results if the bulk $\Delta(k)$ exhibits time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, B3u symmetry. Ultimately, these new techniques adumbrate a novel spectroscopic approach to identification of intrinsic topological superconductors and their superconductive topological surface states.</p>

            <h2>Quasiparticle interference and spectral function of the UTe$_2$ superconductive surface band</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adeline Crépieux, Emile Pangburn, Shuqiu Wang, Kuanysh Zhussupbekov, Joseph P. Carroll, Bin Hu, Qiangqiang Gu, J.C.Séamus Davis, Catherine Pépin, Cristina Bena</p>
            <p>We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$. We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p>

            <h2>Spin disorder state induced by Mg$^{2+}$ doping in a Kitaev material Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$</h2>

            <p>Due to the dominant Kitaev exchange interactions, the cobaltate, Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$, has been considered to be approximate to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). Here, we investigate both magnetic dilution and chemical pressure effects of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_{6}$ by the substitutions of Mg$^{2+}$ for Co$^{2+}$ through the structural, optical, magnetic and thermodynamic measurements. No structural transition has been observed, and the bandgaps remain constant in all doping levels. Combining with the magnetic and thermodynamic measurements, we find that the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is continuously suppressed with increasing Mg doping levels and completely disappears at $x=0.2$. Interestingly, when the doping level $x$ is larger than 0.2, neither long-range magnetic order nor spin glass state has been detected, and the specific heat has a residual linear term at zero field. All features indicate that Na$_{3}$(Co$_{2-x}$Mg$_{x}$)SbO$_{6}$ system enters into a novel spin disorder (NSD) state.</p>

            <h2>Electron pairing by dispersive phonons in altermagnets: re-entrant superconductivity and continuous transition to finite momentum superconducting state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Iorsh</p>
            <p>We consider an altermagnet subject to the electron attractive potential mediated by the dispersive phonons. While altermagnetism suppresses superconductivity, scattering of electrons on the Fermi surface by thermal phonons suppresses altermagnetism. We show that this leads to the re-entrant superconductivity over temperature and to the stabilization of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) finite momentum superconducting state at low temperatures. The effect is mediated by the retardation effects and no d-wave pairing interaction is required.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced superconductivity in co-doped infinite-layer samarium nickelate thin films</h2>

            <p>Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small c-axis parameter of 3.26 Å and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. We observe distinct magnetotransport behaviors in europium-containing samples, including negative magnetoresistance and field-enhanced superconductivity. By establishing a clear correlation between decreasing c-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems, these findings establish clear materials design principles for achieving higher transition temperatures in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Majorana edge and end modes in Josephson junction of $p$-wave superconductor with magnetic barrier</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minakshi Subhadarshini, Amartya Pal, Pritam Chatterjee, Arijit Saha</p>
            <p>We propose a theoretical model describing a Josephson junction featuring a magnetically textured barrier within two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both $p_x + p_y$ and $p_x + ip_y$ type pairing symmetries. Our study reveals the influence of the magnetic barrier strength and its spatial periodicity on the system's topological properties, in terms of local density of states and Josephson current calculations. Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures.</p>

            <h2>Generic power laws in higher-dimensional lattice models with multidirectional hopping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Animesh Hazra, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Anirban Mukherjee, Punyabrata Pradhan</p>
            <p>We show that lattice models in $d>1$ dimensions with mass-conserving and multidirectional hopping dynamics exhibit power-law correlations for generic parameter values, even {\it far} from phase transition point (if any). The key idea for generating the algebraic decay is the notion of {\it multidirectional} hopping, which means that several chunks of masses, or several particles, can hop out simultaneously from a lattice site in multiple directions, consequently breaking detailed balance. Notably, the systems are described by continuous-time Markov jump processes, are diffusive, {\it lattice-rotation symmetric}, spatially homogeneous and thus have {\it no} net mass current. Using hydrodynamic and exact microscopic theory, we show that, in dimensions $d > 1$, the steady-state static density-density and ``activity''-density correlations in the thermodynamic limit decay {\it universally} as $\sim 1/r^{(d+2)}$ at large distance $r=|{\bf r}|$; the strength of the power law is exactly calculated for several models and expressed in terms of the bulk-diffusion coefficient and mobility tensor. In particular, our theory explains why center-of-mass-conserving dynamics, used to model disordered {\it hyperuniform} state of matter, should result in generic long-ranged correlations in the systems.</p>

            <h2>Universal Optical Conductivity from Quantum Geometry in Quadratic Band-Touching Semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-geun Oh, Sun-Woo Kim, Kun Woo Kim, Bartomeu Monserrat, Jun-Won Rhim</p>
            <p>Exploring the quantum geometric properties of solids beyond their topological aspects has become a key focus in current solid-state physics research. We derive the geometric formula for optical conductivity from the quantum metric tensor, applicable to the low-energy regime. This general formulation also depends on the detailed shape of the band dispersion in addition to the geometric properties of the Bloch wave function. We demonstrate, however, that for quadratic band-touching (QBT) semimetals, the optical conductivity simplifies to $\sigma = (e^2/8\hbar)d^2_\mathrm{max}$ when the light frequency exceeds a critical threshold, where $d_\mathrm{max}$ represents the maximum Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance around the band-crossing point. This result indicates that the optical conductivity of QBT semimetals is universal and determined entirely by quantum geometry, independent of other details of the band structure. Furthermore, under time-reversal and rotational symmetries, $d_\mathrm{max}$ is restricted to discrete values of 0 or 1, leading to a quantized universal optical conductivity. Through first-principles calculations, we show that our findings are applicable to real materials, including bilayer graphene, Pd$_3$P$_2$S$_8$, and other realistic material candidates. Our work underscores the critical role of quantum geometry in governing optical properties, which can be probed through standard optical methods.</p>

            <h2>A Promising Method for Strongly Correlated Electrons in Two Dimensions: Gutzwiller-Guided Density Matrix Renormalization Group</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui-Ke Jin, Rong-Yang Sun, Hong-Hao Tu, Yi Zhou</p>
            <p>The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.</p>

Both solutions of the Schrödinger equation and solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation at different values of the Fermi energy are considered. It is shown that for the Bethe-Salpeter equation, which takes into account the existence of the Fermi surface, there is a discrete spectrum in the system of two electrons.

            <h2>Quantum Geometry and Many-Body Landau-Zener Tunneling in Time-dependent Quantum Systems with Instantaneous Quantum Integrability</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Wang, Xiaodong He, Jianda Wu</p>
            <p>We study quantum geometric effects in time-dependent quantum many-body systems quenched from integrable systems through a unitary transformation whose phase operator is linear in time. We establish a theorem stating that the Berry connection matrix thus all associated geometric quantities of the time-dependent many-body system, can be precisely characterized by excitations up to two-particle processes derived from the quantum integrable system. This geometric characterization provides a powerful lens for analyzing dynamical transitions in driven many-body settings. To illustrate the many-body geometric influence, we analyze a prototypical time-dependent Ising chain subjected to both a small longitudinal field and a slowly rotating transverse field, whose low-energy physics in the scaling limit is instantaneously governed by the quantum $E_8$ integrable field theory. Focusing on the quantum geometric potential (QGP), we show the QGP continuously suppresses the instantaneous energy gaps with decreasing longitudinal field, thereby enhancing many-body Landau-Zener tunneling as evidenced by the Loschmidt echo and its associated spectral entropy. The critical threshold for the longitudinal field strength is determined, where the spectral entropy linearly increases with system size and exhbits hyperscaling behavior when approaching to the threshold. When the longitudinal field passes the threshold and decreases toward zero, the QGP continuously leads to vanishing instantaneous energy gaps involving more low-energy excitations, resulting in increasing spectral entropy indicative of many-body Landau-Zener tunneling. Our results unveil telltale quantum geometric signatures in time-dependent many-body systems, elucidating the intricate interplay between quantum geometry and dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Exploring the Finite-Temperature Behavior of Rydberg Atom Arrays: A Tensor Network Approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuzhou Han, Hao Zhang, Lixin He</p>
            <p>Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for experimental research and a challenging subject for theoretical investigation in quantum science. In this study, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of two-dimensional square-lattice Rydberg atom arrays using the projected entangled pair states (PEPS) method. By analyzing the thermal behavior of systems in the checkerboard and striated phases, we extract critical exponents and identify phase transition characteristics. Our results confirm that the checkerboard phase transition belongs to the 2D Ising universality class, while the striated phase exhibits critical exponents that deviate from known universality classes, possibly due to finite-size effects. These findings provide theoretical insights into the thermal stability of quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays and offer valuable guidance for future experimental efforts.</p>

            <h2>Emergent ferromagnetic ladder excitations in heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_{2}$</h2>

            <p>Low-dimensional spin fluctuations play a crucial role in unconventional superconductors, with quasi-one-dimensional spin excitations potentially linked with spin-triplet superconductivity. The heavy fermion superconductor CeSb$_2$ exhibits an unusual large inverted S-shaped upper critical field that suggests a possible triplet pairing state within its pressure-induced superconducting dome. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we discover quasi-one-dimensional magnetic excitations in CeSb$_2$ emerging from nearly square Ce layers with minor orthorhombic deformation. We show that the data are well described by a ferromagnetic spin ladder model, where the "rungs" of the ladder straddle Ce bilayers. Moreover, we find that diffuse excitations akin to those in the ordered phase persist well above $T_{\rm N}$, suggesting that quasi-one-dimensional ferromagnetic paramagnons may significantly contribute to the unusual superconductivity that appears under pressure once magnetic order is suppressed.</p>

            <h2>Molecular Insights into the Crystallization of 4'-Hydroxyacetophenone from Water: Solute Aggregation, Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Polymorph Selection</h2>

            <p>In this work insights into the structural rearrangements occurring in aqueous solution, prior to the nucleation of different 4'-hydroxyacetophenone (HAP) forms from water were obtained, through a combination of thermomicroscopy, micro-differential scanning calorimetry, density and speed of sound measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results confirmed our previous observation that cooling crystallization of HAP is intermediated by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and, depending on the initially selected concentration range, selectively leads to the formation of different crystal forms. Analysis of the solution properties before the onset of LLPS revealed that, in the HAP mole fraction range xHAP \< 0.004 (Zone I), where hydrate H2 ultimately crystallizes, small, solvated clusters are initially present in solution, which remain approximately invariant in size, shape and HAP/H2O proportion as the temperature decreases. For the xHAP \&gt; 0.005 range (Zone III), where anhydrous form I crystallizes, large HAP/water aggregates (that can even percolate the whole system as xHAP approaches the 0.005 limit) are already initially present in solution. As cooling progresses, they become more compact, a process accompanied by a reduction in water content, and which is more significant as the solution concentration increases. The 0.004 \< xHAP \< 0.005 (Zone II) range corresponds to a transition region where, as xHAP increases, the physical properties of the solution initially evolve from those typical of Zone I and, at a certain point, abruptly change and start converging to those typical of Zone III. In all zones, the colloidal particles formed upon LLPS (from which crystallization results) can also reduce their water content on cooling, but the extent of this process increases as xHAP moves from Zones I and II, where hydrates are formed, to Zone III, where anhydrous Form I is produced.</p>

            <p>The two-dimensional triangular lattice (TAL) is a model system of magnetic frustration and competing interactions, where skyrmion spin vortices can be induced by a vertical magnetic field $B$. We target the binary compound GdGa$_2$ with an undistorted TAL of Gd$^{3+}$ Heisenberg moments. At higher temperature ($T > 5$ K, $B = 0$, phase II), we reveal the cycloidal spin textures in GdGa$_2$ via resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS). Further, a transition with strong magneto-elastic response occurs when cooling into the zero-field ground state ($T < 5$ K, phase I). We also report the thermodynamic phase boundaries of $B$-induced magnetic A-phases, which are suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field and which have enhanced resistivity due to the partial opening of a charge gap. In analogy to Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, these phases may represent a superposition of various cycloids, possibly a Néel skyrmion lattice. Our work lays the basis for further studies of the magnetic phase diagram of GdGa$_2$.</p>

            <p>Radiation-induced crystal lattice damage and its recovery in wide bandgap oxides, in particular beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3), is a complex process. This paper presents the first study on the process of the defects accumulation in beta-Ga2O3 implanted with Rare Earth (RE) ions and the impact of Rapid Thermal Annealing (RTA) on the defects formed. (-201) oriented beta-Ga2O3 single crystals were implanted with Yb ions fluences ranging from 1 x 1012 to 5 x 1015 at/cm2. Channeling Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS/c) was used to study the crystal lattice damage induced by ion implantation and the level of structure recovery after annealing. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of collected spectra were performed by computer simulations. The resulting accumulation curve reveals a two-step damage process. In the first stage, the damage of the beta-Ga2O3 is inconspicuous, but begins to grow rapidly from the fluence of 1 x 1013 at/cm2, reaching the saturation at the random level for the Yb ion fluence of 1 x 1014 at/cm2. Further irradiation causes the damage peak to become bimodal, indicating that at least two new defect forms develop for the higher ion fluence. These two damage zones differently react to annealing, suggesting that they could origin from two phases, the amorphization phase and the new crystalline phase of Ga2O3.</p>

            <h2>Rietveld Refinement and NMR Crystallographic Investigations of Multicomponent Crystals Containing Alkali Metal Chlorides and Urea</h2>

            <p>New mechanochemical preparations of three multicomponent crystals (MCCs) of the form MCl:urea.nH2O (M = Li+, Na+, and Cs+) are reported. Their structures were determined by an NMR crystallography approach, combining Rietveld refinement of synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data (PXRD), multinuclear (35Cl, 7Li, 23Na, and 133Cs) solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. Mechanochemical syntheses of the three MCCs, two of which are novel, are optimized for maximum yield and efficiency. 35Cl SSNMR is well-suited for the structural characterization of these MCCs since it is sensitive to subtle differences and/or changes in chloride ion environments, providing a powerful means of examining H...Cl-bonding environments. Alkali metal NMR is beneficial for identifying the number of unique magnetically and crystallographically distinct sites and enables facile detection of educts and/or impurities. In the case of NaCl:urea.H2O, 23Na MAS NMR spectra are key, both for identifying residual NaCl educt and for monitoring NaCl:urea.H2O degradation, which appears to proceed via an autocatalytic decomposition process driven by water (with a rate constant of k = 1.22x10-3 s-1). SSNMR and PXRD were used to inform the initial structural models. Following Rietveld refinement, the models were subjected to dispersion-corrected plane-wave DFT geometry optimizations and subsequent calculations of the 35Cl EFG tensors, which enable the refinement of hydrogen atom positions, as well as the exploration of their relationships to the local hydrogen bonding environments of the chloride ions and crystallographic symmetry elements.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in Stillinger-Weber Silicon</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himani Rautela, Shiladitya Sengupta, Vishwas V. Vasisht</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical properties of liquid and supercooled liquid silicon, modeled using the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential, to examine the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation. Towards this end, we examine the relationship among various dynamical quantities, including (i) the macroscopic transport coefficients - self diffusion coefficient $D$ and viscosity $\eta$, (ii) relaxation time $\tau_{\alpha}$ as well as (iii) lengthscale dependent relaxation times $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ over a broad range of temperature $T$, pressure $P$ and density $\rho$ covering both equilibrium and metastable liquid state points in the phase diagram. Our study shows a weak break down in SE relation involving $D$ and $\eta$, and the loci of \Revision{the breakdown of the SE relation} (SEB) is found in the high T liquid phase. The $\tau_{\alpha}$, when used as a proxy to $\eta$, shows distinct breakdown in the SE relation whose loci is found in the supercooled liquid phase. Interestingly, certain parts of the phase diagram shows that loci of onset of slow dynamics lie below the loci of SEB, suggesting a regime that exhibits Arrhenius but non-Fickian behaviour. Computation of $\tau_{\alpha}(q)$ enables us to extract the lengthscale associated with the Fickian to non-Fickian behaviour using which we show that the \Revision{breakdown of the SE relation} occurs only below a specific lengthscale at a given temperature. Further we also compare the SEB loci with other features of the phase behaviour, including the loci of compressiblity maximum, density maximum as well as diffusivity maximum.</p>

            <p>Excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (1L-TMD) are highly bound states characterized by a Rydberg-like spectrum of discrete energy levels. Within this spectrum, states with odd-parity are known as dark excitons because transitions to the ground state are forbidden by selection rules. This makes their stationary and transient characterization challenging using linear optical techniques. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of a 2p dark excitonic state in 1L-WS$_2$ can be directly retrieved by measuring the Autler-Townes splitting of bright states in a three-pulse experiment. The splitting of the bright 1s excitonic state, observed by detuning a mid-infrared control field across the 1s-2p transition, provides an accurate characterization of the 2p state, which is used here to reveal its dynamics following a sudden photoinjection of free carriers in the conduction band. We observe a qualitatively different dynamics of the 1s and 2p levels, which is indicative of symmetry-dependent screening and exciton-exciton interactions. These findings provide new insights into many-body effects in TMDs, offering potential avenues for advancing the next generation optoelectronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sakineh Mizani, Martin Oettel, Péter Gurin, Szabolcs Varga</p>
            <p>We study the orientational ordering and close packing behavior of a quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) hard superellipse system in which centers of particles are restricted to a line while they can rotate freely in a two-dimensional plane. Through the aspect ratio (k), the elongation of the particles and through the deformation parameter (n), the shape can be tuned between ellipses and rectangles. Maxima in the pressure ratio (P/Phd) (where P and Phd are the pressure of hard superellipses and that of q1D hard disks) are a good indicator for the continuous structural change from isotropic to nematic order. This change occurs at higher densities than the sharp nematic transitions of corresponding two-dimensional and three-dimensional hard body systems. Additionally, suitable close packing exponents describing the close-packing limit show universality in that they depending only on n and certain combinations are independent of both k and n.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Etienne Wamba, Jeremie Bai, A. Serge Tchakoutio Nguetcho</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical instabilities of an ultracold Bose-Bose mixture with long-range dipole-dipole interactions, trapped in deep optical lattices and subject to periodically varying contact interaction. The effect of beyond-mean-field corrections due to quantum fluctuations is considered. In the tight-binding regime, we employ Wannier functions to derive a discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation that captures the dynamics of the system. Using linear stability analysis coupled to multiple scale expansion, we systematically study the modulational and parametric instabilities of the system, identifying the conditions under which these instabilities emerge. The corresponding instability domains are found and examined. The roles of long-range interactions and quantum fluctuations are highlighted, demonstrating their significant impact on the stability and dynamics of the lattice system. Our analytical predictions are validated through direct numerical simulations, which confirm the instability diagrams through the effective onset of instabilities and reveal the intricate interplay between interaction strength, quantum fluctuation, and the long-range nature of the dipole-dipole forces. This work provides insights into the control and manipulation of ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices, which have potential applications in quantum simulation and condensed matter physics.</p>

            <h2>Linear statistics at the microscopic scale for the 2D Coulomb gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Le Doussal, Gregory Schehr</p>
            <p>We consider the classical Coulomb gas in two dimensions at the inverse temperature $\beta=2$, confined within a droplet of radius $R$ by a rotationally invariant potential $U(r)$. For $U(r)\sim r^2$ this describes the eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre ensemble of random matrices. We study linear statistics of the form ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(|{\bf x}_i|)$, where ${\bf x}_i$'s are the positions of the $N$ particles, in the large $N$ limit with $R=O(1)$. It is known that for smooth functions $f(r)$ the variance ${\rm Var} \,{\cal L}_N= O(1)$, while for an indicator function relevant for the disk counting statistics, all cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 2$ behave as $\sim \sqrt{N}$. In addition, for smooth functions, it was shown that the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ of order $q \geq 3$ scale as $\sim N^{2-q}$. Surprisingly it was found that they depend only on $f'(|\bf x|)$ and its derivatives evaluated exactly at the boundary of the droplet. To understand this property, and interpolate between the two behaviors (smooth versus step-like), we study the microscopic linear statistics given by $f(r) \to f_N(r) = \phi((r-\hat r) \sqrt{N}/\xi)$, which probes the fluctuations at the scale of the inter-particle distance. We compute the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ at large $N$ for a fixed $\phi(u)$ at arbitrary $\xi$. For large $\xi$ they match the predictions for smooth functions which shows that the leading contribution in that case comes from a boundary layer of size $1/\sqrt{N}$ near the boundary of the droplet. Finally we show that the full probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$ take two distinct large deviation forms, in the regime ${\cal L}_N \sim \sqrt{N}$ and ${\cal L}_N \sim N$ respectively. We also discuss applications of our results to fermions in a rotating harmonic trap and to the Ginibre symplectic ensemble.</p>

            <p>A transformation between the magnetically ordered CeCoGe$_3$ and heavy fermion CeFeGe$_3$ is isostructural but not isoelectronic, therefore the characterization of the electronic structure of the CeCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge$_3$ series is of special importance. We report both the experimental investigation by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and the first-principles calculations within the full-potential local-orbital (FPLO) scheme based on the density functional theory. Experimentally, we investigate mainly the valence band and the Ce $3d$ spectra, both giving the possibility to conclude about the level of the $f$ states localization. Computationally, we investigate the most characteristic CeCoGe$_3$, CeCo$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$Ge$_3$, and CeFeGe$_3$ compositions. Based on the electronic band structure results, we calculate the X-ray photoelectron spectra of the valence band. We consider the effects of the spin-orbit coupling and intra-atomic Hubbard U repulsion. Furthermore, we discuss the charge distribution and occupation of valence-band orbitals. The experimentally observed evolution of the 3$d$ band with the Fe concentration is related to the decrease of the number of electrons and reduction of the 3$d$ photoionization cross-sections. Calculations indicate that charge is transferred mainly from the Ce to Ge sites and the bondings are formed mainly by the Ce 5$d$, Fe/Co 3$d$, and Ge 4$p$ and 4$s$ orbitals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max Hirschberger, Satoru Hayami, Yoshinori Tokura</p>
            <p>Skyrmion formation in centrosymmetric magnets without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions was originally predicted from unbiased numerical techniques. However, no attempt has yet been made, by comparison to a real material, to determine the salient interaction terms and model parameters driving spin-vortex formation. We identify a Hamiltonian with anisotropic exchange couplings, local ion anisotropy, and four-spin interactions, which is generally applicable to this class of compounds. In the representative system Gd3Ru4Al12, anisotropic exchange drives a fragile balance between helical, skyrmion lattice, and transverse conical (cycloidal) orders. The model is severely constrained by the experimentally observed collapse of the SkL with a small in-plane magnetic field. For the zero-field helical state, we further anticipate that spins can be easily rotated out of the spiral plane by a tilted magnetic field or applied current.</p>

            <h2>Screening in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Gebhard, Kevin Bauerbach, Örs Legeza</p>
            <p>We provide solid evidence for the long-standing presumption that model Hamiltonians with short-range interactions faithfully reproduce the physics of the long-range Coulomb interaction in real materials. For this aim, we address a generic Hubbard model that captures the quantum phase transitions between metal, Mott insulator, and charge-density-wave insulator, in the absence of Fermi-surface nesting. By comparing the quantum phase diagrams for the $1/r$-Hubbard model on a half-filled chain with nearest-neighbor and $1/r$-long-range interactions, we argue that the inclusion of long-range interactions is not crucial for a proper description of interacting many-electron systems. To this end, we employ the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method on finite lattices and antiperiodic boundary conditions to determine the quantum phase transitions between the metallic Luttinger liquid for weak interactions, the Mott-Hubbard insulator for dominant on-site interactions, and the charge-density wave insulator for dominant inter-site interactions. The two phase diagrams qualitatively agree inasmuch as the quantum phase transitions are continuous in both cases. Moreover, simple Hartree-Fock theory and the atomic limit provide renormalization factors that allow us to quantitatively map the two phase diagrams onto each other. As a practical advantage, our findings imply that computational efforts can be reduced tremendously by using models with short-range interactions only.</p>

Through systematic analysis of symmetry-allowed terms in the free energy, we establish complete phase diagrams governed by competing interaction parameters. Our theory reveals distinct magnetic configurations including single-Q, double-Q, and triple-Q states, each characterized by unique symmetry breaking patterns and collective excitations. The framework provides fundamental insights into complex magnetic orders recently observed in materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, where the interplay between geometric frustration and multiple ordering vectors leads to exotic magnetic states. Our results establish clear connections between microscopic interactions, broken symmetries, and experimentally observable properties, offering a powerful tool for understanding and predicting novel magnetic phases in frustrated magnets.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals ferromagnets, such as Fe5GeTe2, offer a promising platform for spintronic devices based on chiral magnetic textures, provided a significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) can be induced to stabilise them. Here, we directly measure DMI in epitaxial Fe5GeTe2 thin films using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and observe a consistent DMI (D = 0.04 mJ/m2) across various thicknesses. Its weak thickness dependence, combined with the nominally symmetric film interfaces, suggests a bulk origin. Although we do not determine the microscopic mechanism, our findings are compatible with ab-initio calculations linking DMI to partial ordering of Fe split sites. Additionally, we find a low magnetic dissipation (alpha < 0.003). The observed DMI, which could be further enhanced by optimising the Fe site ordering, combined with low dissipation, makes Fe5GeTe2 a strong candidate for exploring the dynamics of chiral magnetic textures in two-dimensional materials.</p>

First we recover the known properties of the traditional model with two-spin interactions by applying the renormalization approach for arbitrary size of the block. For the model with three-spin couplings we calculate the critical point and demonstrate that the phase transition is controlled by an infinite disorder fixed point. We have determined the typical correlation-length critical exponent, which seems to be different from that of the random transverse Ising chain with nearest-neighbor couplings. Thus this model represents a new infinite disorder universality class.</p>

            <p>We utilized high-pressure methods to synthesize the oxides AReO$4$ (A=Zn, Mg) and characterized their crystal structures as monoclinic wolframite-type. By combining muon spin spectroscopy ($\mu^+$SR) with DFT calculations for muon stopping sites, we identify two possible magnetic spin structures for both compounds: $\Gamma_3$ with the propagation vector $\mathbf{k} = (0,1/2,0)$ and $\Gamma_4$ with $\mathbf{k} = (0,0,0)$. In both cases, the magnetic moments are canted from the principal axes within the $ac$-plane. The ordered moment of the proposed structures is $\mathbf{0.29(5)~\mu\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_3$ and $\mathbf{0.25(8)~\mu_\mathrm{B}}$ for $\Gamma_4$. The low moment is consistent with the absence of a magnetic contribution to the neutron powder diffraction (NPD) spectra. Bond valence sum (BVS) analysis supports the oxidation state of Re being Re$^{6+}$ in the compounds, and we suggest that a combination of $t_\mathrm{2g}$ orbital splitting due to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and $d$-$p$ orbital hybridization is responsible for the strongly suppressed ordered magnetic moment.</p>

            <h2>Accurate Formula for the Effective Conductivity of Highly Clustered Two-Phase Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Murray Skolnick, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Two-phase heterogeneous materials arising in a variety of natural and synthetic situations exhibit a wide-variety of microstructures and thus display a broad-spectrum effective physical properties. Given that such properties of disordered materials generally depend on an infinite-set of microstructural correlation functions that are typically unobtainable, in practice, one must consider rigorous bounds and approximations on the effective properties that depend on a limited set of nontrivial microstructural information. Torquato derived [Random Heterogeneous Materials, Microstructure and Macroscopic Properties (2002)] such an approximation for the effective thermal/electrical conductivity of two-phase microstructures that perturb about those that realize the well-known self-consistent formula; a key feature of such microstructures being phase-inversion symmetry which can be observed in certain cellular, bicontinuous, and porous materials. Here, we show via extensive numerical simulations that this virtually unexamined approximation, which depends on up to three-point correlations, predicts accurately the effective conductivities of various two- and three-dimensional two-phase microstructures across phase volume fractions in which both phases can form large and well-connected clusters; including certain phase-inversion symmetric microstructures as well as phase-inversion asymmetric dispersions of certain fully penetrable particles. We also highlight the accurate sensitivity of this approximation to phase-connectedness properties by showing that it predicts percolation thresholds that are in good quantitative and/or qualitative agreement with known thresholds for the models considered here. Finally, we discuss how this formula can be used to design materials with desirable effective conductivity properties and thus aid in materials by design.</p>

            <p>Additively manufactured auxetic structures offer desirable qualities like lightweight, good energy absorption, excellent indentation resistance, high shear stiffness and fracture toughness among others. A wide range of materials from polymers to metals can be used to fabricate these structures. In contrast to conventional materials, auxetic structures exhibit negative Poisson's ratios. Hence, unique mechanical properties can be achieved by specific design. In this work, two types of structures, namely re-entrant auxetic and non-auxetic hexagonal honeycomb, are investigated. Large deformation analyses in both 2D plane strain and 3D are conducted using linear triangular and tetrahedral multi-field displacement-pressure elements. Hyperelastic with rate-independent plasticity constitutive models are utilized and calibrated with experimental uni-axial tensile test results. The structures are subjected to compression and tension at both transversal and longitudinal directions. The contact domain method is employed to capture both self-contact and the interaction between the structure and loading plates. The obtained results show consistency with the experimental data. The outcomes of the analyses regarding the re-entrant auxetic structure agree with the expected behavior, showing a negative value of Poisson's ratio and greater efficiency of energy absorption than the hexagonal honeycomb. By understanding the influence of the loading direction on the structural behavior, equivalent Poisson's ratio and energy absorption a reliable theoretical framework for prospective designs of the lattice materials can be established.</p>

            <p>Capillary suspensions containing anisotropic rod particles exhibit complex microstructural behaviors. Our study investigates the orientation, network formation, and rheological properties of glass microrods in capillary suspensions with varying secondary liquid volumes. Using confocal microscopy, rheometry, and rheoconfocal techniques, we reveal how capillary forces affect particle alignment and movement, and consequently, the microstructure of the samples. As the volume fraction of the secondary liquid increases, the structure of the rod network exhibits a transition from point-to-point contact to side-to-side aligned clusters. This structural change leads to pronounced changes in coordination number, clustering coefficient, and particle orientation distribution. In contrast to spherical systems, the average clustering coefficient decreases with increasing coordination number, denoting the formation of particle clusters with complex configurations instead of solely side-to-side alignment. Rheological measurements demonstrate the sensitivity of rod-based networks to deformation, with shorter linear viscoelastic regions compared to spherical particle systems. The research provides insights into designing advanced materials with tunable mechanical properties through controlled particle interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Bernard, Tony Jin, Stefano Scopa, Shiyi Wei</p>
            <p>We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>A new method is introduced for calibrating lateral force as measured by an atomic force microscope (AFM), making use of both an interferometric detector and an optical beam detector on the same instrument. The method may be implemented automatically and performed with minimal user input. The microscope has the capability to measure the probe tip height in situ, which allows for a complete lateral force calibration without changing the sample or probe. Two options for lateral force measurements are described wherein the two detectors are alternately used to measure normal and lateral forces, and methods for applying the calibration protocol for both alternatives are provided. The tip height measurement is validated by direct comparison with an electron micrograph and they are generally in agreement to within 1.4 microns. For most cantilevers tested, the complete lateral calibration method is consistent with the wedge calibration method to within the intrinsic uncertainty of the wedge method.</p>

            <h2>A geometrically inspired constitutive framework for damage and intrinsic self-healing of elastomers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanhita Das, Nivedita Kumari</p>
            <p>Autonomic interfacial self-healing in elastomers enables their reprocessing and recycling, making them valuable for applications such as ballistic resistance, surface coatings, adhesives, and biomedical materials. This article prescribes a geometry-based damage-healing theory for autonomic healing in elastomers, built on a framework where damage induces an incompatibility in the Euclidean material manifold, transforming it into a Riemannian manifold. Healing restores the Euclidean state through a reversing damage variable or an evolving healing variable. The reversing damage variable models the rebonding mechanism while the healing variable accounts for healing by chain diffusion and entanglement. The model also predicts healing where rebonding is preceded by chain diffusion. The microforce balance governs the evolution of the damage and healing variables, capturing rate-dependent damage and intrinsic temperature-independent healing. The model is validated through numerical simulations, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional simulations, demonstrating accurate predictions of coupling between damage and healing and post-healing mechanical response. The model also predicts the recovery of fracture toughness with healing time in supramolecular elastomers, aligning with experimental data. With minimal parameters, the model is versatile and can easily be used for material design and structural analysis, surpassing existing models in simplicity and predictive capability.</p>

            <h2>Adhesion differentials control the rheology of biomimetic emulsions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Quentin Guigue, Marc Besse, Raphael Voituriez, Alexis M. Prevost, Elie Wandersman, Matthias Merkel, Lea-Laetitia Pontani</p>
            <p>Animal morphogenesis involves complex tissue deformation processes, which require tight control over tissue rheology. Yet, it remains insufficiently understood how tissue rheology results from the interplay between its supracellular structure and cellular forces, such as cortical tension, cellular pressure, and cell-cell adhesion. Here, we follow a biomimetic approach to study this interplay, focusing on the cellular adhesion hierarchy. We mimic adhesive cells with oil droplets whose adhesion strength and specificity can be flexibly tuned. Using microfluidics, we expose 2D emulsions to an oscillatory shear, and we develop a method to quantify their rheology using only image data. We find that emulsions made of two droplet types with a high adhesion differential progressively change their yielding behavior across subsequent shear cycles. Combining this with vertex model simulations, we show that the observed drift in yielding behavior is due to a progressive compaction, which only occurs in emulsions with a high adhesion differential and only when exposed to oscillatory shear. Gradients of cell compaction have been observed during animal development. Our work demonstrates how such gradients can be used to control gradients of tissue rheological properties. Moreover, the progressive compaction suggests the emergence of a pumping mechanism, which potentially acts in many cellular materials, from tissues to foams.</p>

            <h2>Pseudopotentials that move: From inertia to electromagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Massimiliano Stengel, Miquel Royo, Emilio Artacho</p>
            <p>Recent works have pointed out some worrisome inconsistencies in linear-response calculations performed with nonlocal pseudopotentials. Here we show that most of these issues are fixed by correctly adapting the pseudopotential to the motion of the corresponding nucleus, with a velocity dependence of the nonlocal operator. This prescription restores the correct Galilean covariance of the Schrödinger equation, and the expected identity between mechanical rototranslations and electromagnetic perturbations. We demonstrate our arguments by relating the interatomic force constants to the electromagnetic susceptibility of the system via a set of exact sum rules. Among other virtues, these results conclusively reconcile the inertial and electrical definitions of the Drude weight in metals.</p>

            <h2>Content-Addressable Memory with a Content-Free Energy Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Félix Benoist, Luca Peliti, Pablo Sartori</p>
            <p>Content-addressable memory, i.e. stored information that can be retrieved from content-based cues, is key to computation. Besides natural and artificial neural networks, physical learning systems have recently been shown to have remarkable ability in this domain. While classical neural network models encode memories as energy minima, biochemical systems have been shown to be able to process information based on purely kinetic principles. This opens the question of whether neural networks can also encode information kinetically. Here, we propose a minimal model for content-addressable memory in which the kinetics, and not the energy function, are used to encode patterns. We find that the performance of this kinetic encoding approach is comparable to that of classical energy-based encoding schemes. This highlights the fundamental significance of the kinetic stability of kinetic traps as an alternative to the thermodynamic stability of energy minima, offering new insights into the principles of computation in physical and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Nonlocal Coulomb Repulsion on Superconductivity and Density-Wave Orders in Bilayer Nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Zhan, Congcong Le, Xianxin Wu, Jiangping Hu</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and its thin films has sparked significant interest in understanding their pairing mechanism and correlated states. While previous theoretical studies have mainly focused on onsite Coulomb interactions, the role of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion has been neglected, leaving its effect unexplored and elusive. In this work, we comprehensively explore the effect of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion on both superconductivity and density-wave orders in the presence of onsite interactions by performing functional renormalization group calculations. We find that interlayer repulsion suppresses the interlayer intra-orbital $s_{\pm}$-wave pairing and spin-density-wave order, while driving a transition to an interlayer inter-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing and a mirror-symmetry breaking charge order. This transition occurs across a wide range of charge doping and is independent of the presence of the $\gamma$ pocket around M point. Remarkably, the critical scale of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductivity is significantly lower than that of the $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, suggesting that the former pairing is unlikely to account for the observed high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Additionally, the intralayer nearest-neighbor repulsion promotes an in-plane charge density wave order with a vector of $(\pi,\pi)$. Our findings highlight profound impact of nonlocal Coulomb repulsion and the robustness of interlayer pairing associated with the bilayer structure and multi-orbital nature, advancing the understanding of the complex correlation effects within bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soham Chandra</p>
            <p>This study employs Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm to investigate the thermomagnetic properties of a site-diluted trilayered ferrimagnetic system with spin-$1/2$ particles placed on square monolayers. The system is composed of two different types of theoretical atoms, labeled $A$ and $B$, resulting in two distinct configurations, $ABA$ and $AAB$. Atoms of the same type $(A-A$ and $B-B)$ exhibit ferromagnetic interactions, while unlike atoms $(A-B)$ display antiferromagnetic interactions. The $A$-layers are randomly site-diluted with non-magnetic atoms and the percentage of dilution is varied from 5\% to 45\%. Depending upon the concentration of these impurities, both the compensation and critical points shift, leading to different equilibrium ferrimagnetic behaviors. The phase area in the Hamiltonian parameter space, \textit{without} compensation, scales according to the relation: $\ln |A(\rho)/\tilde{A}|=ae^{b\rho}$ . Attention is paid to the mathematical relationships between the compensation temperature and the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities. Suggested mathematical formulas reveal how the threshold impurity concentration is linked to the Hamiltonian parameters.</p>

            <p>Recently, numerous techniques have been reported for generating optically active defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which hold transformative potential for quantum photonic devices. However, achieving on-demand generation of desirable defect types in scalable hBN films remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that formation of negative boron vacancy defects, VB-, in suspended, large-area CVD-grown hBN is strongly dependent on the type of bombarding particles (ions, neutrons, and electrons) and irradiation conditions. In contrast to suspended hBN, defect formation in substrate-supported hBN is more complex due to the uncontrollable generation of secondary particles from the substrate, and the outcome strongly depends on the thickness of the hBN. We identify different defect types by correlating spectroscopic and optically detected magnetic resonance features, distinguishing boron vacancies (formed by light ions and neutrons) from other optically active defects emitting at 650 nm assigned to anti-site nitrogen vacancy (NBVN) and reveal the presence of additional dark paramagnetic defects that influence spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and zero-field splitting parameters, all of which strongly depend on the defect density. These results underscore the potential for precisely engineered defect formation in large-scale CVD-grown hBN, paving the way for the scalable fabrication of quantum photonic devices.</p>

In particular, the results of calculations indicate qualitative and even quantitative universality in the behavior of the mentioned lattice systems of different geometry and dimensionality at the same values of a certain reduced temperature when that behavior is expressed in terms of some dimensionless parameters.

            <p>We report the temperature, pressure and composition dependence of some basic properties of model liquid water-methanol mixtures. For this purpose the isobaric-isothermal molecular dynamics computer simulations are employed. Our principal focus is on the united atom non-polarizable UAM-I-EW model for methanol which was recently parametrized the paper by Garcia-Melgarejo et al. [J. Mol. Liq., 2021, 323, 114576], combined with the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ water model. In perspective, the methanol model permits a convenient extension for other monohydric alcohols mixed with water. The behavior of density, excess mixing volume and enthalpy are described. Partial mixing properties are interpreted. Besides, we explored the trends of behavior of self-diffusion coefficients of the species of a mixture. The quality of predictions of the model is critically evaluated by detailed comparisons with experimental results. Various results are novel and provide new insights into the behavior of the mixtures in question at different temperatures and at high pressures.

            <h2>Variational solution of the superconducting Anderson impurity model and the band-edge singularity phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teodor Iličin, Rok Žitko</p>
            <p>We propose a set of variational wavefunctions for the sub-gap spin-doublet and spin-singlet eigenstates of the particle-hole symmetric superconducting Anderson impurity model. The wavefunctions include up to two Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the continuum which is necessary to correctly capture the weak-coupling asymptotics in all parameter regimes. The eigenvalue problems reduce to solving transcendental equations. We investigate how the lowest singlet state evolves with increasing charge repulsion $U$, transitioning from a proximitized state (a superposition of empty and doubly occupied impurity orbitals, corresponding to an Andreev bound state) to a local moment that is Kondo screened by Bogoliubov quasiparticles (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state). This change occurs for $U = 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the BCS gap. At this point, the band-edge effects make the eigenenergy scale in a singular way as $\Gamma^{2/3}$, where $\Gamma$ is the hybridization strength. Away from this special point, regular $\Gamma$-linear behavior is recovered, but only for $\Gamma \lesssim (U/2-\Delta)^2/\Delta$. The singular behavior thus extends over a broad range of parameters, including those relevant for some quantum devices in current use. The singular state is an equal-superposition state with maximal fluctuations between the local impurity charge configurations. Accurately capturing the band-edge singularity requires a continuum model, and it cannot be correctly described by discrete (truncated) models such as the zero-bandwidth approximation or the superconducting atomic limit. We determine the region of parameter space where the second spin-singlet state exists: in addition to the whole $U<2\Delta$ ABS region, it also includes a small part of the $U>2\Delta$ YSR region for finite values of $\Gamma$, as long as some ABS component is admixed.</p>

            <p>The excess entropy of restricted primitive model electrolytes is calculated using a potential based approach through the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theories. The theories are utilized in conjunction with a statistical thermodynamics equation that is shown to be equivalent to thermodynamic integration. Electrolyte systems having ionic valencies 1:1 and 2:2 with diameters $3 \times 10^{-10}$~m and 4.25 $\times 10^{-10}$ m are treated over a wide range of concentrations. The exact radial distribution functions for the model electrolytes obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble are compared with the corresponding theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the radial distribution functions from the theories and the simulations are used in the Laird-Haymet entropy expansion equations [J. Chem. Phys., 1994, 100, 3775] to estimate the excess entropy of the solutions. These equations take into account multi-particle distribution functions, which are approximated using a ``ring'' term. In general, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory gives results that are more consistent with the simulation data than those from the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The results show that the excess entropy is negative with its absolute value increasing for 1:1 electrolytes with increasing concentration. The symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly overestimated, while the modified Poisson-Boltzmann values are slightly underestimated relative to the simulations. The curves for 1:1 electrolytes including that from the Laird-Haymet equations are consistent with each other, while only the MPB curves for 2:2 electrolytes at $4.25 \times 10^{-10}$ m are qualitative relative to the simulations up to about 1 mol/dm$^{3}$. The 2:2 electrolyte curves reveal a characteristic inflection and plateau....</p>

In addition, it also witnesses the transition occurring in the PT-broken phase, where the spectrum goes from complex to purely imaginary (damped oscillations to sheer decay). For a purely imaginary spectrum, the Krylov spread fidelity, which measures how the time-dependent spread reaches its stationary state value, serves as a probe of previously undetected dynamical phase transitions.</p>

For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moiré mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</p>

Such phenomena have been observed in natural predator-prey systems, and characterized in the laboratory as showing unusual phase relationships in population dynamics, including a $\pi$ phase shift between predator and prey (evolutionary cycles) and even undetectable prey oscillations compared to those of the predator (cryptic cycles). Here we present a generic individual-level stochastic model of interacting populations that includes a subpopulation of low nutritional value to the predator. Using a master equation formalism, and by mapping to a coherent state path integral solved by a system-size expansion, we show that evolutionary and cryptic quasicycles can emerge generically from the combination of intrinsic demographic fluctuations and clonal mutations alone, without additional biological mechanisms.</p>

            <p>While doping and defects are often considered detrimental to material performance, at the nanoscale, modifications are needed to create novel properties beneficial for device applications. In this work, we focus on optimizing graphene as a gas sensor for detecting toxic gases such as nitrogen oxide (NO). The study explores the effects of doping graphene sheets with transition metals (Cu, Au, Pt) and introducing a single vacancy (SV) defect at the center of the sheet. Pristine, defected, and doped graphene sheets are systematically analyzed as potential sensing materials for NO gas detection. The investigation includes the design of graphene-based devices and the evaluation of their electrical I-V characteristics under different configurations. The sensing mechanism is examined through parameters such as electronic properties, charge transfer, adsorption energy, electrical characteristics (I-V), sensitivity, and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. The results indicate that defected graphene demonstrates superior gas adsorption performance, with an adsorption energy of 8.316 eV and a sensitivity of 51.1%, outperforming both pristine and doped graphene. These findings establish defected graphene as a promising candidate for NO gas sensing applications, while doped graphene shows moderate sensing potential.</p>

            <h2>An atomistic approach for modeling of polarizability and Raman scattering of water clusters and liquid water</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atanu Paul, Ilya Grinberg</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a framework for atomistic modeling of electronic polarizability to predict the Raman spectra of hydrogen-bonded clusters and liquids from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The total polarizability of the system is assumed to arise from contributions of both the monomer unit and intermolecular interactions. The generalized bond-polarizability model (GBPM), inspired by the classic bond-polarizability model, effectively describes the electronic polarizability of a monomer. To account for the electronic polarizability arising from intermolecular interactions, we use a basis set of rapidly decaying functions of interatomic distances. We apply this model to calculate the electronic polarizability and Raman spectra of water clusters ((H2O)r, r = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and liquid water. The computational results are compared with the results of quantum-mechanical calculations for clusters and to experimental data for the liquid. It is demonstrated that this simple and physically motivated model, which relies on a small number of parameters, performs well for clusters at both low and high temperatures, capturing strong anharmonic effects. Moreover, its high transferability suggests its applicability to other water clusters. These results suggest that a hierarchical approach based on the Jacob's ladder of increasingly sophisticated and accurate atomistic polarizability models incorporating additional effects can be used for efficient modeling of Raman spectra from MD simulations of clusters, liquids and solids.</p>

Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA outperforms the method of cumulant expansion in terms of efficiency, ease of use, and broad applicability. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanay Kibe, Pratik Roy</p>
            <p>The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.</p>

            <h2>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tâm Johan Nguyên, Darrick Lee, Bernadette Jana Stolz</p>
            <p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p>

            <h2>Equivariant Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Global Charge Redistribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moin Uddin Maruf, Sungmin Kim, Zeeshan Ahmad</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to quantum mechanical simulations for predicting material properties. Message-passing graph neural networks, commonly used in these MLIPs, rely on local descriptor-based symmetry functions to model atomic interactions. However, such local descriptor-based approaches struggle with systems exhibiting long-range interactions, charge transfer, and compositional heterogeneity. In this work, we develop a new equivariant MLIP incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions through explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom, specifically global charge distribution within the system. This is achieved using a charge equilibration scheme based on predicted atomic electronegativities. We systematically evaluate our model across a range of benchmark periodic and non-periodic datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both short-range equivariant and long-range invariant MLIPs in energy and force predictions. Our approach enables more accurate and efficient simulations of systems with long-range interactions and charge heterogeneity, expanding the applicability of MLIPs in computational materials science.</p>

            <h2>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srijan Kumar</p>
            <p>We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</p>

            <h2>The Stochastic Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah M. MacKay</p>
            <p>In Ref. arXiv:2502.08816, Hawking radiation was analyzed through a statistical mechanics framework, revealing a structured microstate description of black hole horizons and information transfer into the radiation background. This study extends that approach by formulating Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation in the language of stochastic mechanics, employing an analytical Langevin framework and a numerical Euler iteration scheme. Both methods confirm that small black holes behave as thermal systems with Gaussian noise, while larger black holes develop a structured noise spectrum that aligns with the gradual contraction of the horizon. This suggests an alternative interpretation of Hawking radiation as an effective surface fuzziness, encoding horizon-scale fluctuations. The appendix provides a Wolfram Mathematica blueprint for numerical simulations, open to heuristic modifications for further exploration of black hole noise spectra.</p>

            <p>We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the asymmetric parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form $$\begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*}$$ and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with strong Szegő limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.</p>

            <p>Using an effective field-theoretical approach, we investigate the properties of weakly bound two-neutron halo nuclei (also known as Borromean nuclei) that do not support a low-energy $s$-wave core-neutron resonance. Extending the recently formulated effective field theory for weakly bound Borromean nuclei, we incorporate corrections arising from the effective range of neutron-neutron scattering and evaluate their impact on the mean-square radii and electromagnetic response. In particular, we compute the ratio of the matter and charge radii, the shape of the $E1$ dipole strength function, and the electric polarizability. Our results indicate that these corrections remain numerically small when the two-neutron separation energy of the Borromean nucleus is much less than 1~MeV.</p>

We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.</p>

We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.</p>

            <p>Learning to remember over long timescales is fundamentally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While much prior work has explored why RNNs struggle to learn long timescales and how to mitigate this, we still lack a clear understanding of the dynamics involved when RNNs learn long timescales via gradient descent. Here we build a mathematical theory of the learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained to integrate white noise. We show that when the initial recurrent weights are small, the dynamics of learning are described by a low-dimensional system that tracks a single outlier eigenvalue of the recurrent weights. This reveals the precise manner in which the long timescale associated with white noise integration is learned. We extend our analyses to RNNs learning a damped oscillatory filter, and find rich dynamical equations for the evolution of a conjugate pair of outlier eigenvalues. Taken together, our analyses build a rich mathematical framework for studying dynamical learning problems salient for both machine learning and neuroscience.</p>

            <p>Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> André L. P. Considera, Simon Thalabard</p>
            <p>We investigate the behaviors of fluid parcel trajectories in a multifractal extension of the Kraichnan model of turbulent advection, obtained by coupling one-dimensional monofractal white-in-time Gaussian flows to a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC). The resulting random flows are characterized by the interplay between a smoothness exponent $\xi\in(0,1)$ controlling the correlation decay of the Gaussian component and the intermittency parameter $\gamma \in (0,\sqrt 2)$ prescribing the deviations from self-similarity. In recent numerical work, this coupling was observed to induce a smoothing effect, whereby two-particle separations exhibit behavior similar to those in (monofractal) Gaussian flows only with increased smoothness exponent. The purpose of this work is to develop a rigorous theory of this phenomenon, contrasting the quenched setting where the GMC has prescribed realization to an annealed setting where the GMC is averaged over. Using the theory of 1D Markov processes we characterize the Lagrangian flow through boundary behaviors at the origin for the two-particle separation process upon varying $\xi$ and $\gamma$. This extends to a multifractal setting the stochastic/deterministic transition and the coalescing/non-coalescing transition well known in the monofractal Kraichnan setting. We show that the separation process present some analogies with multiplicative 1D versions of the Liouville Brownian Motion, a canonical diffusion evolving within a random landscape induced by the GMC and previously introduced in the context of Liouville quantum gravity. In particular, both quenched and annealed phase diagrams are retrieved upon considering a multiplicative Liouville Brownian motion characterized by a smoothness parameter $\xi+\gamma^2$ and an intermittency exponent $\gamma$.</p>

            <h2>Self-Organizing Graph Reasoning Evolves into a Critical State for Continuous Discovery Through Structural-Semantic Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Markus J. Buehler</p>
            <p>We report fundamental insights into how agentic graph reasoning systems spontaneously evolve toward a critical state that sustains continuous semantic discovery. By rigorously analyzing structural (Von Neumann graph entropy) and semantic (embedding) entropy, we identify a subtle yet robust regime in which semantic entropy persistently dominates over structural entropy. This interplay is quantified by a dimensionless Critical Discovery Parameter that stabilizes at a small negative value, indicating a consistent excess of semantic entropy. Empirically, we observe a stable fraction (12%) of "surprising" edges, links between semantically distant concepts, providing evidence of long-range or cross-domain connections that drive continuous innovation. Concomitantly, the system exhibits scale-free and small-world topological features, alongside a negative cross-correlation between structural and semantic measures, reinforcing the analogy to self-organized criticality. These results establish clear parallels with critical phenomena in physical, biological, and cognitive complex systems, revealing an entropy-based principle governing adaptability and continuous innovation. Crucially, semantic richness emerges as the underlying driver of sustained exploration, despite not being explicitly used by the reasoning process. Our findings provide interdisciplinary insights and practical strategies for engineering intelligent systems with intrinsic capacities for long-term discovery and adaptation, and offer insights into how model training strategies can be developed that reinforce critical discovery.</p>

            <p>Spin ice compounds enable the exploration of the dynamics of magnetic monopoles in condensed matter systems. In this study, we use ac calorimetry to probe the dynamical response of the heat capacity of the classical spin-ice compounds Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ at low temperatures (0.5-5 K). Using frequencies of 0.01-500 Hz, we find a strong frequency dependence in the measured heat capacity and are able to study thermal relaxation effects on the corresponding timescales. The relaxation time $\tau$ is determined from the frequency dependence of the heat capacity as the characteristic frequency below which the heat capacity saturates. The extracted $\tau$ shows a divergent behavior below 1 K reaching $\sim$6 s at 0.65 K, similar to the relaxation time seen in previous studies. Corresponding specific heat shows a maximum around this temperature. Performing dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, we verify that the specific heat frequency response has its origin in the slow magnetic monopole dynamics indigenous to spin ice. We find a timescale of 20 ms per Monte Carlo step at 4 K in contrast to 2.5 ms mentioned in previous studies by other techniques.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase transitions universally exist in the ground and excited states of quantum many-body systems, and they have a close relationship with the nonequilibrium dynamical phase transitions, which however are challenging to identify. In the system of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates, though dynamical phase transitions with correspondence to equilibrium phase transitions in the ground state and uppermost excited state have been probed, those taken place in intermediate excited states remain untouched in experiments thus far. Here we unravel that both the ground and excited-state quantum phase transitions in spinor condensates can be diagnosed with dynamical phase transitions. A connection between equilibrium phase transitions and nonequilibrium behaviors of the system is disclosed in terms of the quantum Fisher information. We also demonstrate that near the critical points parameter estimation beyond standard quantum limit can be implemented. This work not only advances the exploration of excited-state quantum phase transitions via a scheme that can immediately be applied to a broad class of few-mode quantum systems, but also provides new perspective on the relationship between quantum criticality and quantum enhanced sensing.</p>

Consequently, full spectral functions obtained for the model manifests the unique power-law singularity behaviour at the spectral threshold, confirming the validity of nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory. Our method advances the theory of dynamical correlation functions with high precision towards the thermodynamic limit, and is capable of benchmarking experimental observation of such novel correlated properties.</p>

            <p>High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ reveals features of the electronic structure that extend our understanding of the layered strontium ruthenates. The spectra near the Fermi energy are very different from the non-magnetic analogues Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi surface contours around the zone corners. The most dramatic results are two narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV below the Fermi-level, a spin-minority hole-like band at the Brillouin zone center, and a spin-majority saddle-band van Hove singularity at the zone edge, which exhibits almost 100\% spin-polarization at low temperature, and a strong temperature dependent coherence-incoherence crossover attributed to Hund metal correlations. Quantitative comparison of the ARPES to spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify the specific antibonding and nonbonding orbital origins of the narrow bands, with a prediction of different spatial localization in the central and outer layers. This is shown to be consistent with experimental ARPES multi-zone matrix element intensity variations, and implicates outer-layer-specific control of the in-plane metamagnetism. The renormalization of the bands relative to the mean-field DFT, the demonstration of spin-polarized oxygen bands, and of spin-minority and spin-majority band-crossing hybridization, provide a more complete picture of the magnetism which displays aspects of both delocalized and local moment behavior.</p>

            <p>First principles-based predictions of lattice thermal conductivity (TC) from perturbation theory have achieved significant success. Usually, it only included three-phonon (3ph) scattering processes, only recently four-phonon (4ph) scattering processes were found to have a comparable impact as 3ph scattering at medium and high temperatures in various materials. While the influence of 4ph scattering on TC at low temperatures was generally believed to be insignificant. By combining the first-principles calculations, machine learning techniques, and Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), we find that there are unusually strong 4ph processes even in the low-frequency range of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as h-XN (X = B, Al, Ga), which have a remarkable influence on the low-temperature TC. Such strong 4ph processes originated from the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) phonon mode of 2D materials. Furthermore, we find that the intensity of 4ph scattering and thus TC can be effectively manipulated by changing the dispersion of ZA phonon mode, which can be easily achieved through strain engineering. The present study provides new insights into low-temperature phonon transport and its manipulation in 2D materials.</p>

            <p>The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here, using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO: they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range above 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph interactions in SVO.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobuyuki Okuma</p>
            <p>In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</p>

            <p>We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</p>

            <p>Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) is a powerful tool to evaluate the structure of multi-component systems by decomposing scattering intensities $I$ measured with different scattering contrasts into partial scattering functions $S$ of self- and cross-correlations between components. The measured $I$ contains a measurement error, $\Delta I$, and $\Delta I$ results in an uncertainty of partial scattering functions, $\Delta S$. However, the error propagation from $\Delta I$ to $\Delta S$ has not been quantitatively clarified. In this work, we have established deterministic and statistical approaches to determine $\Delta S$ from $\Delta I$. We have applied the two methods to (i) computational data of a core-shell sphere and experimental CV-SANS data of (ii) clay/polyethylene glycol (PEG) aqueous solutions and (iii) polyrotaxane solutions, and have successfully estimated the errors of \(S\). The quantitative error estimation of \(S\) offers us a strategy to optimize the combination of scattering contrasts to minimize error propagation.</p>

In this work, we develop a new and general approach of assessing model domain and demonstrate that our approach provides accurate and meaningful domain designation across multiple model types and material property data sets. Our approach assesses the distance between data in feature space using kernel density estimation, where this distance provides an effective tool for domain determination. We show that chemical groups considered unrelated based on chemical knowledge exhibit significant dissimilarities by our measure. We also show that high measures of dissimilarity are associated with poor model performance (i.e., high residual magnitudes) and poor estimates of model uncertainty (i.e., unreliable uncertainty estimation). Automated tools are provided to enable researchers to establish acceptable dissimilarity thresholds to identify whether new predictions of their own machine learning models are in-domain versus out-of-domain.</p>

            <h2>Stochastic density functional theory for ions in a polar solvent</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Illien, Antoine Carof, Benjamin Rotenberg</p>
            <p>In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.</p>

            <h2>Minimum time connection between non-equilibrium steady states: the Brownian gyrator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Patrón, C. A. Plata, A. Prados</p>
            <p>We study the problem of minimising the connection time between non-equilibrium steady states of the Brownian Gyrator. This is a paradigmatic model in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, an overdamped Brownian particle trapped in a two-dimensional elliptical potential, with the two degrees of freedom $(x,y)$ coupled to two, in principle different, thermal baths with temperatures $T_x$ and $T_y$, respectively. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle reveals that shortest protocols belong to the boundaries of the control set defined by the limiting values of the parameters $(k,u)$ characterising the elliptical potential. We identify two classes of optimal minimum time protocols, i.e. brachistochrones: (i) regular bang-bang protocols, for which $(k,u)$ alternatively take their minimum and maximum values allowed, and (ii) infinitely degenerate singular protocols. We thoroughly investigate the minimum connection time over the brachistochrones in the limit of having infinite capacity for compression. A plethora of striking phenomena emerge: sets of states attained at null connection times, discontinuities in the connection time along adjacent target states, and the fact that, starting from a state in which the oscillators are coupled, uncoupled states are impossible to reach in a finite time.</p>

            <h2>Partial presentence of memory in bubble breakup: incomplete universality acquired by broken symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ikumi Yoshino, Ko Okumura</p>
            <p>When a water drop falls from a faucet, the drop is created with the formation of an axisymmetric constriction region, which thins down to breakup. Near the singularity of the breakup the physics at small scales becomes important, which could lead to universal dynamics independent of the scales setting the initial boundary conditions, as if memories were lost. This is true in the drop breakup surrounded by air or less viscous fluid, but not in the bubble breakup surrounded by more viscous fluid, under no geometrical confinement. Recently, it has been reported that the axisymmetry at the constriction region can be broken when a system of bubble breakup is confined. Here, we focus on the confined and non-axisymmetric breakup and find its dynamics self-similar: shapes of the liquid-air interface at different times collapsing onto a master curve. Unexpectedly, the master curve depends on the smallest among the length scales setting the initial boundary conditions but not on the other scales: The system retains partial memory, acquiring an incomplete universality by broken symmetry. Furthermore, we find the collapse is space-time dependent: the collapse onto the linear region of the master curve near the breakup tip persists for long time after breakup, while the parabolic region away from the tip is observed only for short time. We elucidate the physics in our findings, including the space-time dependent collapse, exploiting analogy with critical phenomena, which has guided recent developments across physics.</p>

            <h2>Correlation versus dissipation in a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Masaya Nakagawa, Norio Kawakami</p>
            <p>We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melina Luethi, Henry F. Legg, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja</p>
            <p>A minimal Kitaev chain, consisting of two quantum dots connected via a superconductor, can host highly localized near-zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). These states have been proposed as promising candidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup. However, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are actually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we study PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit, not all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some PMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there is no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve into true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.</p>

            <p>We study the roughening of interfaces in phase-separated active suspensions on substrates. At both large length and timescales, we show that the interfacial dynamics belongs to the |q|KPZ universality class discussed in Besse et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187102 (2023). This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, however, or for sufficiently small systems, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.</p>

Our method combines asymptotic techniques for the long-distance behavior of the gas (similar to Luttinger liquid theory) with known short-distance expansions. We derive analytical results for the limiting cases of strong and weak interactions, and provide a general procedure for calculating one-body correlations at any interaction strength. A step-by-step explanation of the numerical method used to compute Green's functions (needed as input to our theory) is included. We benchmark our method against exact numerical calculations and compare its predictions to recent experimental results.</p>

            <p>Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport thus has attracted tremendous interest. However, without comparing with mechanisms tied to disorder, it is still unclear whether the quantum metric dominates in recent experiments. We exhaust all possible mechanisms of nonlinear transport under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges, by finding five more disorder-related mechanisms and their nonlinear conductivity formulas. With the help of the formulas, we derive the scaling law to identify distinct mechanisms in the recent experiments [Gao, et al., Science 381, 181 (2023); Wang, et al., Nature 621, 487 (2023)], determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for all 122 magnetic point groups to guide future experiments, and calculate the nonlinear conductivity to explain the sophisticated features in the experiments of the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films. Our theory will facilitate future experiments and applications of nonlinear transport.</p>

            <p>Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.</p>

            <p>MoS2 has recently emerged as a promising material for enabling quantum devices and spintronic applications. In this context, an improved physical understanding of the g-factor of MoS2 depending on device geometry is of great importance. Resistively detected electron spin resonance (RD-ESR) could be employed to and the determine the g-factor in micron-scale devices However, its application and RD-ESR studies have been limited by Schottky or high-resistance contacts to MoS2. Here, we exploit naturally n-doped few-layer MoS2 devices with ohmic tin (Sn) contacts that allow the electrical study of spin phenomena. Resonant excitation of electron spins and resistive detection is a possible path to exploit the spin effects in MoS2 devices. Using RD-ESR, we determine the g-factor of few-layer MoS2 to be ~1.92 and observe that the g-factor value is independent of the charge carrier density within the limits of our measurements.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Breaking of Quantum Strings in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Xu, Xue-Feng Zhang</p>
            <p>Leveraging the rapid development of quantum simulators, the intriguing phenomena of string breaking are observed across various quantum simulation platforms \cite{Rydberg_kagome,qbit_string_breaking}. However, the strings can only be broken by quenching the tension energy due to the system size limitation, such "tensile breaking" behaves quite the same as in one-dimension \cite{ion_string_breaking}. To discover the distinctive properties of quantum strings in two dimensions, we utilize a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo method to simulate a ten times larger scale (743-site) Kagome Rydberg atom array which can be described with U(1) lattice gauge theory. With designed edges, one end of the string can be easily grasped, allowing for clearly observing the dynamics of the dangling gauge charge at the open end. Then, we can drag each end in opposite directions perpendicular to the string. As the separation distance increases, asymptotic freedom-like behavior is detected. Eventually, the string breaks because the distance between both ends surpasses the string's length, so named "geometric breaking". Distinct from "tensile breaking," the two newly formed strings are suddenly uncorrelated, accompanied by a sudden energy increase. Lastly, we study multiple strings and successfully prepare a heart-like superposition state of broken and unbroken quantum strings with three gauge charges attached reminiscent of quarks and gluon. This work can benefit the comprehension of quantum strings and also shed light on the simulation of high-energy physics.</p>

We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of a homogeneous quasi-two-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 condensate by quenching from the zero-momentum into the plane wave phase through a sudden change in Raman coupling strength. We demonstrate that the correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamic scaling during the late-time dynamics, allowing us to determine the dynamic critical exponent.</p>

            <p>The wave-like nature of electrons is evident from quantum interference effects observed during the photoemission process. When there are different nuclei in the unit cell of a crystal and/or structural distortions, photo-electron wavefunctions can interfere, giving rise to peculiar intensity modulation of the spectrum, which can also hide energy states in a photoemission experiment. The 2H phase of transition metal dichalcogenides, with two nonequivalent layers per unit cell and charge density wave distortion, is an optimal platform for such effects to be observed. Here, we discover undetectable states in 2H-TaS2, interpreting high-resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy considering interference effects of the correlated electron wave functions. In addition, phase mismatching induced by the charge density wave distortion, results in evident signature of the phase transition in the photoemission spectrum. Our results highlight the importance of quantum interference, electronic correlations and structural distortion to understand the physics of layered materials.</p>

            <p>Interacting or nonlinear lattices can host emergent particle-like modes, such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles, whose band topology and other properties are potentially highly tunable. Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials. Here, we implement a nonlinear driven-dissipative circuit whose fluctuations are Bogoliubov modes possessing nontrivial non-Hermitian band topology. We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.</p>

These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</p>

            <p>We investigate chiral quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction and show the correlation-induced Josephson diode effect (JDE) in it. The presence of electron-electron interaction spontaneously creates an imbalance between up- and down-spin electrons during the non-equilibrium transport making the QD effectively magnetic. The simultaneous presence of the chirality and the interaction eventually results in the field-free JDE in our chiral QD junction. We employ the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function technique to study the behavior of the Josephson current (JC) and the rectification coefficient (RC) of our Josephson diode (JD). We show a sign-changing behavior of the RC with the Coulomb correlation and the lead-to-dot coupling strength and find the maximum magnitude of the RC $\sim 72\%$ for moderate interaction strength. Our proposed field-free JD based on interacting chiral QD may be a potential switching component in superconductor based devices.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments show that the relative dielectric constant $\epsilon$ of water confined to a film of nanometric thickness reaches a strikingly low value of 2.1, barely above the bulk's 1.8 value for the purely electronic response.

Instead we propose the 2D polarisability $\alpha_{\perp}$ as the appropriate, well-defined response function whose magnitude can be directly obtained from both measurements and computations. Once the appropriate description is used a very significant reduction, $\sim 30$\%, of the electronic response with respect to the bulk's is observed contrary to what widely assumed, highlighting the importance of electronic degrees of freedom to interpret the dielectric response of polar fluids under nanoconfinement conditions. This is obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

The phase boundaries can be investigated by following thermodynamic anomalies like specific heat, magnetocaloric coefficient, thermal expansion and magnetostriction. We calculate their discontinuities and identify the influence of the field induced quadrupole on them. Furthermore we investigate the elastic constant anomalies which are determined by the static homogeneous quadrupolar RPA response functions. We present a calculation of these anomalies for the appropriate symmetry mode both in the disordered and ordered regime and investigate their change with applied field.

            <p>Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring through continuous weak measurements and feedback can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. We show that, even in the absence of any external thermal bath, the monitoring leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective `quantum' temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering various limiting cases, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in unusual inverse transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</p>

            <p>The bulk photovoltaic effect is a photocurrent generation from alternating electric field, which is a promising candidate for future efficient solar cell technology. It is the second-order optical current, which is the injection current or the shift current. We focus on the direct current generation. By employing a simple two-band model of the $d$-wave altermagnet coupled with the Rashba interaction, we show that the linearly polarized light can generate the injection and shift currents when the Néel vector points to an in-plane direction. The magnitude of the injection current is almost constant over a wide range of the frequency $\omega $ of the applied light provided it is smaller than a certain critical frequency $\omega _{\text{c}}$ and larger than the bulk gap energy $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}$, $\varepsilon _{\text{gap}}<\hbar \omega <\hbar \omega _{\text{c}}$. Hence, the use of the injection current is quite efficient for solar cell technology because any photon whose energy is within this range can be equally utilized.</p>

The results obtained from magnetotransport measurements on two-electron BLG DQDs, where the resonant tunneling transport involves both orbital symmetric and antisymmetric two-particle states, show a rich level spectrum. We observe a magnetic field tunable spin and valley blockade, which is limited by the orbital splitting, the strength of the electron-electron interaction and the difference in the valley g-factors between the symmetric and antisymmetric twoparticle orbital states. Our conclusions are supported by simulations based on rate equations, which allow the identification of prominent interdot transitions associated with the transition from single to two-particle states observed in the experiment.</p>

            <h2>Amorphous silicon structures generated using a moment tensor potential and the activation relaxation technique nouveau</h2>

            <p>Preparing realistic atom-scale models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) is a decades-old condensed matter physics challenge. Herein, we combine the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) to a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to generate seven a-Si models containing between 216 and 4096 atoms. A thorough analysis of their short-range and medium-range structural properties is performed, alongside assessments of excess energy and mechanical properties. The seven ARTn-MTP models are compared with available experimental data and other high quality a-Si models present in the literature. The seven ARTn-MTP a-Si models are in excellent agreement with available experimental data. Notably, several of our models, including the 216-atom, 512-atom, and 1000-atom a-Si models, exhibit low coordination defects without any traces of crystalline grains. Historically overlooked in previous research, our study underlines the need to assess the validity of the continuous random-network hypothesis for the description of perfect amorphous model by characterizing local crystalline environment and to explore the crystallisation process of a-Si through modelling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elina Gilbert, Christophe Poulard, Anniina Salonen</p>
            <p>Understanding a material's dissipative response is important for their use in many applications, such as adhesion. In dispersions the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials, although the physical picture is often elusive. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, and we show that a simple, well-fitting model can induce misinterpretation of the physics in a complex material.</p>

            <h2>Anomalies of Coset Non-Invertible Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Carolyn Zhang</p>
            <p>Anomalies of global symmetries provide important information on the quantum dynamics. We show the dynamical constraints can be organized into three classes: genuine anomalies, fractional topological responses, and integer responses that can be realized in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Coset symmetry can be present in many physical systems including quantum spin liquids, and the coset symmetry can be a non-invertible symmetry. We introduce twists in coset symmetries, which modify the fusion rules and the generalized Frobenius-Schur indicators. We call such coset symmetries twisted coset symmetries, and they are labeled by the quadruple $(G,K,\omega_{D+1},\alpha_D)$ in $D$ spacetime dimensions where $G$ is a group and $K\subset G$ is a discrete subgroup, $\omega_{D+1}$ is a $(D+1)$-cocycle for group $G$, and $\alpha_{D}$ is a $D$-cochain for group $K$. We present several examples with twisted coset symmetries using lattice models and field theory, including both gapped and gapless systems (such as gapless symmetry-protected topological phases). We investigate the anomalies of general twisted coset symmetry, which presents obstructions to realizing the coset symmetry in (gapped) symmetry-protected topological phases. We show that finite coset symmetry $G/K$ becomes anomalous when $G$ cannot be expressed as the bicrossed product $G=H\Join K$, and such anomalous coset symmetry leads to symmetry-enforced gaplessness in generic spacetime dimensions. We illustrate examples of anomalous coset symmetries with $A_5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, with realizations in lattice models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankit Singh, Vinay Vaibhav, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</p>

            <p>We use experiments and theory to elucidate the size effect in capillary breakup rheometry, where pre-stretching in the visco-capillary stage causes the apparent relaxation time to be consistently smaller than the actual value. We propose a method accounting for both the experimental size and the finite extensibility of polymers to extract the actual relaxation time. A phase diagram characterizes the expected measurement variability and delineates scaling law conditions.

            <h2>Scaling laws of shrinkage induced fragmentation phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roland Szatmári, Akio Nakahara, So Kitsunezaki, Ferenc Kun</p>
            <p>We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of the two-dimensional Ising model. Our findings provide a novel insights into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Wang, Andrey V. Chubukov</p>
            <p>In the BCS theory of superconductivity, an instability towards pairing develops at arbitrary weak dimensionless coupling $\lambda$ due to a divergence of logarithmic perturbative series for the pairing susceptibility (Cooper logarithms) at $T_c \sim \omega_0 e^{-1/\lambda}$, where $\omega_0$ is an energy cutoff. On the contrary, in many models of superconductivity out of a non-Fermi liquid, Cooper logarithm is absent and superconductivity emerges only when $\lambda$ exceeds a certain threshold. We argue that there are situations when there is no threshold and at weak coupling the formula for $T_c$ is BCS-like, yet the origin of the pairing instability is fundamentally different from that in the BCS scenario. As an example, we revisit superconductivity in a metal at the onset of $(\pi,\pi)$ spin-density-wave order. Earlier studies of this problem found no threshold and a BCS-like expression for $T_c$ at weak coupling. We argue that, despite this, the pairing is not caused by the Cooper logarithm and in many respects is qualitatively similar to that in non-Fermi liquids.</p>

            <p>We report on the crystal field level splitting and magnetic ground state of the Jeff = 1/2 square lattice antiferromagnets YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 using powder inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and neutron diffraction measurements. Both compounds exhibit a well-isolated $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet ground state under a tetragonal crystal field environment, confirming a robust Jeff = 1/2 picture with slight XY-type anisotropic character in the g-tensor. Notably, the ground state wave functions closely resemble the $\Gamma_{7}$ doublet expected in the perfect cubic limit, consistent with the nearly cubic ligand configuration of eight O2- ions surrounding Yb3+. Below TN =0.21 K, YbBi2IO4 exhibits a stripe long-range magnetic order characterized by an ordering wave vector qm = (1/2, 0, 0) or its symmetry-equivalent (0, 1/2, 0), with magnetic moments aligned along qm. The ordered moment is approximately 79 % of the classical prediction, significantly larger than expected from the isotropic J1-J2 model, suggesting the possible involvement of exchange anisotropy in explaining this observation. We show that symmetry-allowed XXZ and bond-dependent anisotropic exchange terms in a square lattice can play a critical role in stabilizing the stripe order and suppressing the moment reduction as observed. These findings establish YbBi2ClO4 and YbBi2IO4 as unique platforms for exploring rich Jeff = 1/2 magnetism from two less investigated perspectives: (i) on a square lattice and (ii) within a (nearly) cubic ligand environment.</p>

            <p>As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal becomes necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering directions, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches, and features may appear with no clear explanation. To explore both, we perform frequency-resolved q-EELS simulations via the multislice method and compare results to Spectral Energy Density (SED) and Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations. We discuss common misconceptions of phonon behavior and characterization generally and in the context of measured or simulated q-EELS signals. We highlight the presence of an ``interferometric Brillouin zone'' (closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor), resulting from the simultaneous sampling of the lattice across each basis index. We also demonstrate the scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective signal based on this phenomena. Finally, we identify thickness-dependent sensitivity effects, where the upper surface of a film is sampled at a disproportionate level. We show that this can yield sensitivity to through-plane vibrational modes, which may be measured experimentally assuming sufficient sensitivity can be achieved. Our work should serve as a road map to guide momentum-resolved vibrational EELS measurements in the future, particularly as ever-increasing energy and momentum resolution becomes available.</p>

            <p>Constraint Satisfaction Problems are ubiquitous in fields ranging from the physics of solids to artificial intelligence. In many cases, such systems undergo a transition when the ratio of constraints to variables reaches some value $\alpha_{\textrm{crit}}$. Above this critical value, it is exponentially unlikely that all constraints can be mutually satisfied. We calculate the probability that constraints can all be satisfied, $P(\textrm{SAT})$, for the spherical perceptron. Traditional replica methods, such as the Parisi ansatz, fall short. We find a new ansatz, the jammed Parisi ansatz, that correctly describes the behavior of the system in this regime. With the jammed Parisi ansatz, we calculate $P(\textrm{SAT})$ for the first time and match previous computations of thresholds. We anticipate that the techniques developed here will be applicable to general constraint satisfaction problems and the identification of hidden structures in data sets.</p>

            <h2>Extended Fractional Chern Insulators Near Half Flux in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Above the Magic Angle</h2>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1° hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3°, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37° twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.</p>

            <p>Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz~7.7 of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</p>

            <p>Quasicrystals exhibit superconductivity under the unique interplay of long-range order and strong inhomogeneity, distinguishing them from both crystalline and amorphous systems. Understanding how this structural complexity affects superconducting states and phase transitions remains an important open question. Here, we unveil anomalous superconductivity in a dodecagonal quasicrystal using the attractive Hubbard model within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We show that both the gap structure and critical temperature depend on the local pattern due to inhomogeneous charge distribution and kinetic terms. This leads to unconventional phase transitions between mixed phases where superconducting and normal metal regions coexist, even without external fields, which we term pattern-selective superconductivity. Furthermore, superconductivity can be anomalously suppressed even under stronger attractive interactions due to the alignment of the Fermi level with a spectral gap in the fragmented Hartree-shifted spectrum. These findings, not observed in conventional crystals, amorphous systems, or previous studies of quasicrystal superconductivity, highlight the distinct role of quasicrystalline order.</p>

            <p>Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on the origins of this discrepancy due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy. Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of \emph{pre--critical} nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been directly compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</p>

            <h2>Bounds on the rates of statistical divergences and mutual information via stochastic thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Karbowski</p>
            <p>Statistical divergences are important tools in data analysis, information theory, and statistical physics, and there exist well known inequalities on their bounds. However, in many circumstances involving temporal evolution, one needs limitations on the rates of such quantities, instead. Here, several general upper bounds on the rates of some f-divergences are derived, valid for any type of stochastic dynamics (both Markovian and non-Markovian), in terms of information-like and/or thermodynamic observables. As special cases, the analytical bounds on the rate of mutual information are obtained. The major role in all those limitations is played by temporal Fisher information, characterizing the speed of global system dynamics, and some of them contain entropy production, suggesting a link with stochastic thermodynamics. Indeed, the derived inequalities can be used for estimation of minimal dissipation and global speed in thermodynamic stochastic systems. Specific applications of these inequalities in physics and neuroscience are given, which include the bounds on the rates of free energy and work in nonequilibrium systems, limits on the speed of information gain in learning synapses, as well as the bounds on the speed of predictive inference and learning rate. Overall, the derived bounds can be applied to any complex network of interacting elements, where predictability and thermodynamics of network dynamics are of prime concern.</p>

            <p>When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observe anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated because of the implied symmetries between the two steady states, on the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition mode under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effects are no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.</p>

We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l>2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</p>

            <p>Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned via global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench is influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted using the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points; consequently, phase boundaries are precisely delineated. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum spin systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing local quantum quenches and single-site observables.</p>

This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds.

            <p>Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create novel states of matter out of equilibrium. We investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in hybrid quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on hybrid random Haar circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. At criticality, our data is consistent with power-law decay with a tripartite exponent strictly larger than the one of the bipartite logarithmic negativity. The 4-party case is also explored. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</p>

In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with exponent $\approx -0.5$, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</p>

            <p>We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</p>

            <h2>Unifying theory of scaling in drop impact: Forces & maximum spreading diameter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vatsal Sanjay, Detlef Lohse</p>
            <p>The dynamics of drop impact on a rigid surface -- omnipresent in nature and technology -- strongly depends on the droplet's velocity, its size, and its material properties. The main characteristics are the droplet's force exerted on the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is: How do they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber number $We$ (non-dimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity)? Here we perform direct numerical simulations over the huge parameter range $1\le We \le 10^3$ and $10^{-3}\le Oh \le 10^2$ and in particular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the Grossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000); PRL 86, 3316 (2001)]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation rate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different physical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively account for the $We$ and $Oh$ dependences of the maximal impact force and the maximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why viscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for low-viscosity droplets (low $Oh$), in contrast to what had been assumed in prior theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C.J. Pethick, A. Schwenk</p>
            <p>We calculate, to second order in the scattering length between two fermions, the Landau quasiparticle interaction for a low-density mixture of two fermion species with unequal densities at temperature zero. From the Landau parameters we evaluate the energy density and find agreement with the result of Kanno, Prog. Theor. Phys. 44, 813 (1970). The calculations are then extended to the case of two fermion components with different total densities, each with two spin components, a situation of interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics, where the species are neutrons and protons. An interesting finding is that, for low proton concentrations, $x \ll 1$, the leading term in the energy density, beyond the $x^{5/3}$ contribution from the kinetic energy and the $x^2$ one due to the two-body interaction in the mean-field approximation, varies as $x^{7/3} \ln x$. This is to be contrasted with the higher powers of $x$ implicit in many phenomenological energy-density functionals employed in nuclear physics, such as those of the Skyrme type.</p>

            <h2>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiuci Xu</p>
            <p>We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical evolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and the crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to the $6j$-symbol of $U_{\sqrt{q}}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total chord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</p>

            <h2>Near linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Wesle, Giovanna Marcelli, Tadahiro Miyao, Domenico Monaco, Stefan Teufel</p>
            <p>We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a locally unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_{\mathrm{H}}$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance. A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</p>

            <p>We report on tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at 10 K. The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant red-shift of the H-H stretch frequency is found as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.</p>

The targeted applications are quantum technologies at millimeter-wave frequencies, which require measurements at low photon numbers and noise. We show that the high density polyethylene waveguides combine a frequency independent low photon loss with a very low heat conductance. Black high density polyethylene shows a higher attenuation, which is useful to block thermal photons in a cryogenic environment. The dielectric waveguides are thermally anchored and attenuated at several stages of the cryostat. They are individually protected by additional metallic shields to suppress mutual cross-talk and external interference. With this setup, multiple superconducting resonances of a Fabry-Pérot cavity were measured at 10 mK. We find quality factors up to 15 million in the single photon limit for resonances above 100 GHz. These results show no evident influence of atomic two-level systems in the cavity.</p>

            <p>This article introduces a methodology for inducing wavenumber bandgaps via alternating Willis coupling signs. A non-reciprocal wave equation of Willis-type is first considered, and its wave dispersion analyses are carried out via the transfer matrix method. By creating unit cells from two identical Willis-type elastic layers, yet with reversed Willis-coupling signs, a reciprocal band structure peculiarly emerges, although each layer exhibits non-reciprocity if considered individually. Wavenumber bandgaps open due to such unit cell configuration, and their width and limits are analytically quantified. Similarities between materials with reversed-sign Willis coupling and bi-layered phononic crystals are noted, followed by concluding remarks.</p>

            <h2>Material instability and subsequent restabilization from homogenization of periodic elastic lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davide Bigoni, Andrea Piccolroaz</p>
            <p>Two classes of non-linear elastic materials are derived via two-dimensional homogenization. These materials are equivalent to a periodic grid of axially-deformable and axially-preloaded structural elements, subject to incremental deformations that involve bending, shear, and normal forces. The unit cell of one class is characterized by elements where deformations are lumped within a finite-degrees-of-freedom framework. In contrast, the other class involves smeared deformation, modelled as flexurally deformable rods with sufficiently high axial compliance. Under increasing compressive load, the elasticity tensor of the equivalent material loses positive definiteness and subsequently undergoes an ellipticity loss. Remarkably, in certain conditions, this loss of stability is followed by a subsequent restabilization; that is, the material re-enters the elliptic regime and even the positive definiteness domain and simultaneously, the underlying elastic lattice returns to a stable state. This effect is closely related to the axial compliance of the elements. Our results: (i.) demonstrate new possibilities for exploiting structural elements within the elastic range, characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom, to create architected materials with tuneable instabilities, (ii.) introduce reconfigurable materials characterized by 'islands' of stability or instability.</p>

            <p>We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.</p>

In absence of electric fields, we prove that, at half-filling, the ground state of the gauge theory coincides with the $\pi$-flux phase, associated with magnetic flux equal to $\pi$ in every elementary lattice plaquette, provided the fermionic hopping is large enough. This proves in particular the semimetallic behavior of the ground state of the model. Furthermore, we compute the magnetic susceptibility of the gauge theory, and we prove that it is given by the one of massless $2d$ Dirac fermions, thus rigorously justifying recent numerical computations. The proof is based on reflection positivity and chessboard estimates, and on lattice conservation laws for the computation of the transport coefficient.</p>

            <p>A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</p>

            <p>Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana fermions, exhibit profound non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p>

            <p>We investigate the shear viscosity and butterfly velocity of a magnetic field-induced quantum phase transition in five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, which is holographically dual to a class of strongly coupled quantum field theories with chiral anomalies. Our analysis reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where $\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to $T^2$ for $B>B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for $B<B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect the quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</p>

            <p>The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and its time dependence. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number rises only to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophores that facilitates efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. The results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised to control exciton-exciton annihilation.</p>

We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs.

We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric De Giuli</p>
            <p>Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of endogenous control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, control is optimal and an exact mathematical mapping from noise to control is described, where the maximizing the probability of a state becomes the control objective. In Langevin dynamics noise is identified directly with control, while in general Markov jump processes, which include chemical reaction networks and electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Zel'dovich-Grassberger-Goldenfeld-Peliti path integral to identify the `response' or `tilt' field $\pi$ as control, which is proportional to the noise in the semiclassical limit. This solves the longstanding problem of interpreting $\pi$. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks and systems with unstable fixed points. The noise-control mapping builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why the probability is generically a non-smooth function of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agentic behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</p>

            <p>In generic classical and quantum many-body systems, where typically energy and particle number are the only conserved quantities, stationary states are described by thermal equilibrium. In contrast, integrable systems showcase an infinite hierarchy of conserved quantities that inhibits conventional thermalization, forcing relaxation to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), a concept first introduced in quantum many-body physics. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for the emergence of a GGE in a photonic system. By investigating partially coherent waves propagating in a normal dispersion optical fiber, governed by the one-dimensional defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, we directly measure the density of states of the spectral parameter (rapidity) to confirm the time invariance of the full set of conserved charges. We also observe the relaxation of optical power statistics to the GGE's theoretical prediction, obtained using the experimentally measured density of states. These complementary measurements unambiguously establish the formation of a GGE in our photonic platform, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for probing many-body integrability and bridging classical and quantum integrable systems.</p>

            <p>We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.</p>

Using the exact LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of Maxwell-Bloch equations which describe LSP in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE coupled to the LSP, we obtain an explicit expression for the system effective optical polarizability which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the classical coupled oscillator (CO) model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from the temporal dispersion of metal dielectric function affect dramatically the optical spectra as the system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight is shifted towards the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</p>

            <p>With the development of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials, magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is widely used to measure ferromagnetism in 2D systems. Although this effect is usually inactive in antiferromagnets (AFM), recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the presence of MOKE relies on the symmetry of the system and antiferromagnets with noncollinear magnetic order can also induce a significant MOKE signal even without a net magnetization. However, this phenomenon is rarely studied in 2D systems due to a scarcity of appropriate materials hosting noncollinear AFM order. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we investigate the HfFeCl6 monolayer with noncollinear Y-AFM ground states, which simultaneously breaks the time-reversal (T) and time-inversion (TI) symmetry, activating the MOKE even though with zero net magnetic moment. In addition, four different MOKE spectra can be obtained in the four permutation states of spin chirality and crystal chirality. The MOKE spectra are switchable when reversing both crystal and spin chirality. Our study provides a material platform to explore the MOKE effect and can potentially be used for electrical readout of AFM states.</p>

            <p>Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional statistics, bridging between fermions and bosons. We propose an experimental setup to measure the statistical angle of topological anyons emitted from a quantum point contact (QPC) source. The setup involves an droplet along a fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, formed by defining a droplet with two negatively biased gates. In the weak tunneling regime, we calculate the charge current, showing its time evolution depends solely on the anyons' statistical properties, with temperature and scaling dimension affecting only the constant prefactor. We compute the cross-correlation between the anyon current transmitted from the source and the current after the junction, providing a direct method to detect anyon braiding statistics.</p>

            <h2>Multi-orbital effects on superconductivity in kagome metals: Parquet renormalization group analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jae-Ho Han, SungBin Lee</p>
            <p>The Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where the electronic density of states diverges due to saddle points in the band structure, play a crucial role in enhancing electronic correlations and driving various instabilities. In particular, VHS-induced superconductivity has earned significant attention due to its potential to achieve high transition temperatures and its tendency to favor exotic pairing states beyond conventional electron-phonon mechanisms. Despite extensive research on VHS-driven superconductivity, the multi-orbital effect on such systems remains less explored. Motivated by recent experiments on several kagome metals under doping and pressure [this http URL {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.B {\bf 103}, 224513 (2021), this http URL {\it et al.}, this http URL. {\bf 14}, 3899 (2023)], we explore the effects of multi-orbital physics and strong correlations induced by VHS in the kagome lattice, focusing on their impact on superconductivity. Using parquet renormalization group analysis, we uncover eight distinct superconducting instabilities, characterized by order parameters with mixed orbital degrees of freedom. Among these, we identify a parameter regime where $d$-wave-like orbital-singlet spin-triplet order parameters dominate as the leading instability. The degenerate spin-triplet states in this regime are capable of breaking time-reversal symmetry, which is a multi-orbital analogue of chiral spin-triplet superconductivity. These findings highlight the interplay between multi-orbital effects on superconductivity and can apply to the kagome metal systems such as $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) family.</p>

            <p>The kagome lattice has emerged as a fertile ground for exotic quantum phenomena, including superconductivity, charge density waves, and topologically nontrivial states. While AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds have been extensively studied in this context, the broader AB3C5 family remains largely unexplored. In this work, we employ machine-learning-accelerated, high-throughput density functional theory calculations to systematically investigate the stability and electronic properties of kagome materials derived from atomic substitutions in the AV3Sb5 structure. We identify 36 promising candidates that are thermodynamically stable, with many more close to the convex hull. Stable compounds are not only found with a pnictogen (Sb or Bi) as the C atom but also with Au, Hg, Tl, and Ce. This diverse chemistry opens the way to tune the electronic properties of the compounds. In fact, many of these compounds exhibit Dirac points, Van Hove singularities, or flat bands close to the Fermi level. Our findings provide an array of compounds for experimental synthesis and further theoretical exploration of kagome superconductors beyond the already known systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum defects in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides for THz-technologies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jingda Zhang, Su Ying Quek</p>
            <p>Substitutional transition metal (TM) point defects have recently been controllably introduced in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides. We identify quantum defect candidates through a first principles materials discovery approach with 25 TM elements substituting Mo and W in 2D MoS2 and WSe2, respectively. We elucidate trends in the charge transition levels for these 50 systems and report the existence of defects with spin-triplet ground states and a zero field splitting (ZFS) in the terahertz (THz) regime, in contrast to typical gigahertz values. These defects can couple to resonant near-infrared radiation, providing a route to applications as high fidelity qubits controlled by spin-dependent optical transitions. The THz ZFS implies that these high-fidelity operations can take place at higher temperatures compared to the case for GHz qubits. Our results also point toward the possibility of realizing a single photon THz emitter. This work broadens the scope of quantum defects, laying the foundation for next generation THz quantum technologies, a timely and significant research area given the rapid advancement in the development of THz sources and detectors.</p>

            <p>The resurgence of interest in Kondo insulators has been driven by two major mysteries: the presence of metallic surface states and the observation of quantum oscillations. To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 K and dominates transport properties below 150 K, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Trapped Magnetic Vortex Losses in Niobium Resonators at mK Temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Bafia, B. Abdisatarov, R. Pilipenko, Y. Lu, G. Eremeev, A. Romanenko, A. Grassellino</p>
            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10 mK and at 6 GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6 GHz niobium cavity at 10 mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100 mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$ 10 mG limits $Q_0\sim$ 10$^{10}$, or $T_1\sim$ 350 ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$ 1 s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Our results suggest that niobium-based transmon qubits could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeet Shah, Gautam Nambiar, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</p>

            <p>Cold atom arrays in optical lattices offer a highly tunable platform for exploring complex quantum phenomena that are difficult to realize in conventional materials. Here, we investigate the emergence of controllable long-range quantum correlations in a simulated twisted bilayer structure with fermionic cold atoms. By exploiting the incommensurate nature of the twisted bilayer, we observe a significant enhancement of long-range susceptibility, suggesting the formation of stable entangled states between spatially distant localized spins. We further show that the tunability of the interlayer coupling in terms of driving fields enables us to manipulate these entangled states without deformation of lattice structure and extra doping. Our findings provide a pathway for overcoming challenges in establishing strong correlations across distant sites, highlighting the potential of optical lattices as a versatile platform for advanced quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate the confinement of neutral excitons in a one-dimensional (1D) potential, engineered by proximizing hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoSe$_2$ to ferroelectric domain walls (DW) in periodically poled LiNbO$_3$. Our device exploits the nanometer scale in-plane electric field gradient at the DW to induce the dipolar exciton confinement via the Stark effect. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy reveals the emergence of narrow emission lines redshifted from the MoSe$_2$ neutral exciton by up to $\sim100\,$meV, depending on the sample structure. The spatial distribution, excitation energy response and polarization properties of the emission is consistent with signatures of 1D-confined excitons. The large electric field gradients accessible via proximal ferroelectric systems open up new avenues for the creation of robust quantum-confined excitons in atomically thin materials and their heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Schmid-Higgs Mode in the Presence of Pair-Breaking Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Dzero, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>Collective modes in superconductors provided the first realization of the Higgs mechanism. The transverse Goldstone mode acquires a gap (i.e. a mass) when it hybridizes with the electromagnetic gauge field. The longitudinal Schmid-Higgs mode, on the other hand, is always massive. In conventional BCS theory, its gap is exactly $2\Delta$, coinciding with the excitation threshold for quasiparticles. Being situated right at the edge of the continuum spectrum it gives rise to peculiar dynamics for the Schmid-Higgs mode. For instance, when suddenly excited at $t=0$, it exhibits algebraically decaying oscillations of the form $\sim \sin(2\Delta t)/{t}^{1/2}$. In this study, we explore the behavior of Schmid-Higgs oscillations in the presence of pair-breaking mechanisms, such as magnetic impurities or in-plane magnetic fields. These processes suppress the quasiparticle excitation threshold down to $2\varepsilon_g < 2\Delta$, potentially placing the longitudinal mode within the continuum spectrum. Despite this, we show that the algebraically decaying oscillations persist, taking the form $\sim \sin(2\varepsilon_g t)/t^2$. The Schmid-Higgs mode becomes truly overdamped and exponentially decaying only in the gapless superconductors with $\varepsilon_g=0$.</p>

            <h2>Planckian dissipation, anomalous high temperature THz non-linear response and energy relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprate superconductors</h2>

            <p>We have investigated the nonlinear THz 2D coherent spectroscopic response of superconducting La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) thin films as a function of $T$ across a wide range of doping levels from mildly underdoped through extremely overdoped ($T_c < 5$ K). In addition to the large nonlinearities expected in the superconducting state, we find an extended regime of large normal state THz nonlinearity. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional superconductor NbN where the strong nonlinear response promptly disappears at $T_c$. The size of the nonlinear susceptibility in LSCO is $|\chi^{(3)}|\approx 2.2\times10^{-9} m^2/V^2$, which is one of the largest THz range nonlinearities ever measured. The 2DCS measurement shows that the dominant normal state nonlinearities arise from pump-probe processes, of which there are various possible origins. These may be related to the unconventional interactions that lead to the strange metal or the persistence of superconducting correlations to high temperatures. Irrespective of its origin, the large normal state nonlinearity provides an opportunity to measure the energy relaxation rate ($\Gamma_E$) to temperatures where the momentum relaxation rate is linear in T and close to its ``Planckian" form ($\Gamma_M \approx 2kT/h$). We find $\Gamma_E$ to be $10 - 40$ times smaller than the momentum relaxation. This shows that the scattering that causes momentum loss (and $T$-linear) resistivity do not remove appreciable energy from the electrons. Although the $T$-dependence of the momentum relaxation is consistent with quasi-elastic scattering off bosonic collective modes at temperatures above their characteristic energy (the Bloch-Gruneisen temperature for acoustic phonons) it is inconsistent with $\Gamma_E$'s temperature dependence. $\Gamma_E$ is an increasing function of $T$, which is indicative of {\it inelastic} scattering to the phonon bath.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems frequently exhibits broken rotational symmetry, raising fundamental questions about the underlying order parameter symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that electronic nematicity--driven by Coulomb-mediated rotational symmetry breaking--serves as a crucial link to understanding the nature of superconductivity. Utilizing a novel framework of angle-resolved measurement, we reveal an interring angular interplay among nematicity, superconductivity, and strange metallicity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. By establishing a direct correlation between the preferred superconducting transport direction and the principal axis of the metallic phase, our findings place strong constrains on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. This work introduces a new paradigm for probing the microscopic mechanisms governing superconductivity in strongly interacting two-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>Lanthanide (Ln) based LnSbTe materials have garnered significant attention due to rich interplay of long range magnetic ordering and topological properties, driven by unique crystalline symmetry, 4f electron interactions, and pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects. DySbTe, as a heavier lanthanide-based member of the LnSbTe family, stands out with its SOC and larger on site interactions on its 4f electrons, which arise due to the heavier Dy element. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the low-temperature bulk physical properties and the electronic structure of DySbTe using magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and electrical resistivity measurements, along with high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S), and density functional theory calculations. Our thermodynamic measurements revealed an antiferromagnetic ordering below TN = 7.45 K and a subsequent magnetic phase transition at TN1 = 7.15 K. Our transport studies indicate a semimetallic behavior with unusual feature in the ordered state. Our ARPES measurements revealed a diamond-shaped Fermi pocket centered at the G point, with band features that evolve distinctly across various binding energies. STM/S results indicate a minimum in the density of states at around 100 meV below the Fermi level, and ARPES measurements reveal a significant gap present around the X point, differentiating DySbTe from other LnSbTe compounds. These findings enhance our understanding of the SOC effects on the electronic structure and topological properties in the LnSbTe family, highlighting DySbTe as a promising candidate for exploring the interplay between topology and magnetism.</p>

            <p>Classical monoaxial chiral magnets represent a unique magnetic system that allows for the stabilization of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions of equal energy. Unlike a similar situation in frustrated magnets, the energy landscape here is much simpler, consisting of four states: the saturated ferromagnetic state, spin-spiral, skyrmion, and antiskyrmion. This simplicity makes such systems interesting for potential applications that rely on manipulating these states. We study the quantum analog of the already established classical theory by investigating the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we establish that such a model supports the existence of skyrmion and antiskyrmion states of equal energy. This degeneracy allows for the existence of a mesoscopic Schrödinger cat state exhibiting properties of both skyrmion and antiskyrmion. To characterize this superposition, we calculate two-point correlation functions that can be measured in neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we introduce a perturbation in the form of a magnetic field gradient to induce a non-trivial time evolution of the superposition state. We study this time evolution using both a numerical variational approach and the collective coordinates method.</p>

            <h2>Tunneling density of states in exotic superconductors and spatial patterns of particle-hole interference</h2>

            <p>Tunneling spectroscopy of superconductors provides valuable insights into gap symmetry, quasiparticle dynamics, and pairing mechanisms. This paper explores spatial patterns of quasiparticle interference in the tunneling density of states (TDOS) near localized impurities. These patterns emerge because Bogoliubov quasiparticles, as coherent superpositions of electrons and holes, drive reversible particle-to-hole conversion within the superconductor. Impurities act as beam splitters, generating interference between particle and hole states, forming spatial fringes reminiscent of Young's double-slit experiment. In topological superconductors, these interference patterns are further modulated by nodal lines that encode the nodal structure and phase of the gap function, $\Delta(\vec p)$. Notably, the patterns directly reveal the winding number of $\Delta(\vec p)$ phase, offering a unique probe of exotic, non-BCS pairing and a powerful tool for detecting topological superconductivity.</p>

            <p>Owing to their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, normal metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions are leveraged in various thermal devices. This study illustrates that two NISIN reservoirs can achieve a measurable negative differential thermal conductance (NDTC). This phenomenon is enabled by photon-mediated heat exchange, which is profoundly affected by the temperature-dependent impedance matching between the reservoirs. Under appropriate configurations, the heat current is suppressed for increasingly large temperature gradients, leading to NDTC. We also propose experimental configurations where it is possible to discriminate this effect unambiguously. We employ superconducting aluminum in conjunction with either silver or epitaxial InAs to facilitate the experimental observation of NDTC at low temperatures over significant sub-Kelvin ranges. This advances the development of devices that exploit NDTC to enhance heat and temperature regulation in cryogenic environments, such as thermal switches, transistors, and amplifiers.</p>

Here, we theoretically demonstrate and study the emergence of nonreciprocal superconductivity and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect in this system. Our results are based on a fully self-consistent framework for determining the superconducting order parameter from a Kohn-Luttinger mechanism to superconductivity and show that large diode efficiencies, $\sim$ 60%, are achievable and highly tunable by an external displacement field. Moreover, we also find that the diodicity shows a characteristic angular dependence with multiple enhanced lobes, which depend on the Fermi surface structure of the underlying normal state. Hence, our results suggest that the intrinsic superconducting diode effect could provide insights into the type of Fermi surface topology from which superconductivity arises.</p>

We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs.

We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator.

Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</p>

We then consider second laws, showing that the definition admits new entropy increase theorems and connections to thermodynamics. We survey mathematical properties of the definition, and show it resolves some pathologies of the traditional observational entropy in infinite dimensions. Finally, we study the dynamics of this entropy in a quantum random matrix model and a classical hard sphere gas.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Margarita Davydova, Andreas Bauer, Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente, Mark Webster, Dominic J. Williamson, Benjamin J. Brown</p>
            <p>We show how to perform scalable fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates in two dimensions by introducing domain walls between the surface code and a non-Abelian topological code whose codespace is stabilized by Clifford operators. We formulate a path integral framework which provides both a macroscopic picture for different logical gates as well as a way to derive the associated microscopic circuits. We also show an equivalence between our approach and prior proposals where a 2D array of qubits reproduces the action of a transversal gate in a 3D stabilizer code over time, thus, establishing a new connection between 3D codes and 2D non-Abelian topological phases. We prove a threshold theorem for our protocols under local stochastic circuit noise using a just-in-time decoder to correct the non-Abelian code.</p>

            <h2>Information maximization for a broad variety of multi-armed bandit games</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Barbier-Chebbah (EPIMETHEE), Christian L. Vestergaard (EPIMETHEE), Jean-Baptiste Masson (EPIMETHEE)</p>
            <p>Information and free-energy maximization are physics principles that provide general rules for an agent to optimize actions in line with specific goals and policies. These principles are the building blocks for designing decision-making policies capable of efficient performance with only partial information. Notably, the information maximization principle has shown remarkable success in the classical bandit problem and has recently been shown to yield optimal algorithms for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian reward distributions. This article explores a broad extension of physics-based approaches to more complex and structured bandit problems. To this end, we cover three distinct types of bandit problems, where information maximization is adapted and leads to strong performance. Since the main challenge of information maximization lies in avoiding over-exploration, we highlight how information is tailored at various levels to mitigate this issue, paving the way for more efficient and robust decision-making strategies.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic Interactions in Particle Suspensions: A Perspective on Stokesian Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kim William Torre, Joost de Graaf</p>
            <p>Stokesian Dynamics (SD) is a numerical framework used for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particle suspensions at low Reynolds number. It combines far-field approximations with near-field lubrication corrections, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. This work reviews SD and provides a perspective on future directions for this approach. We outline the mathematical foundations, the method's strengths and weaknesses, and the computational challenges that need to be overcome to work with SD effectively. We also discuss recent advancements that improve the algorithm's efficiency, including the use of iterative solvers and matrix-free approaches. In addition, we highlight the limitations of making stronger, albeit more cost-effective approximations to studying hydrodynamic interactions in dense suspensions than made in SD, such as the two-body Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) approximation. To overcome these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that replaces SD's full many-body computations with a neural network trained on SD data. That is, we correct the RPY approximation, while avoiding costly matrix inversions. We demonstrate the potential of this method on a simple system, where we find a close match to SD data while algorithmically outperforming RPY. Our work provides an outlook on the way in which large-scale simulations of particle suspensions can be performed in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <h2>Filters reveal emergent structure in computational morphogenesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hazhir Aliahmadi, Aidan Sheedy, Greg van Anders</p>
            <p>Revolutionary advances in both manufacturing and computational morphogenesis raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew N. Ivanov, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.</p>

            <h2>Bandgap-Dependent Doping of Semiconducting Carbon Nanotube Networks by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer for Stable Thermoelectrics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angus Hawkey, Xabier Rodríguez-Martínez, Sebastian Lindenthal, Moritz C. F. Jansen, Reverant Crispin, Jana Zaumseil</p>
            <p>Networks of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are a promising material for thermoelectric energy harvesting due to their mechanical flexibility, solution processability, high Seebeck coefficients and high electrical conductivities after chemical p- or n-doping. Here, we demonstrate that proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) with benzoquinone (BQ) as the oxidant and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li[TFSI]) for electrolyte counterions is a promising method for p-doping of polymer-sorted semiconducting SWNT networks. The achieved doping levels, as determined from absorption bleaching, depend directly on both the pH of the aqueous doping solutions and the bandgap (i.e., diameter) of the nanotubes within the network. Fast screening of different nanotube networks under various doping conditions was enabled by a high-throughput setup for thermoelectric measurements of five samples in parallel. For small-bandgap SWNTs, PCET-doping is sufficient to reach the maximum thermoelectric power factors, which are equal to those obtained by conventional methods. In contrast to other doping methods, the electrical conductivity of PCET-doped SWNTs remains stable over at least 5 days in air. These results confirm PCET to be a suitable approach for more environmentally friendly and stable doping of semiconducting SWNTs as promising thermoelectric materials.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum transport generated by the bipartite entanglement in two-dimensional conformal field theory at finite density with the $U(1) \times U(1)$ symmetry associated to the conservation of the electric charge and of the helicity. The bipartition given by an interval is considered, either on the line or on the circle. The continuity equations and the corresponding conserved quantities for the modular flows of the currents and of the energy-momentum tensor are derived. We investigate the mean values of the associated currents and their quantum fluctuations in the finite density representation, which describe the properties of the modular quantum transport. The modular analogues of the Johnson-Nyquist law and of the fluctuation-dissipation relation are found, which encode the thermal nature of the modular evolution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ze-Tong Zhuang, Dario Rosenstock, Bao-Jie Liu, Aaron Somoroff, Vladimir E. Manucharyan, Chen Wang</p>
            <p>Recent studies have shown that parasitic two-level systems (TLS) in superconducting qubits, which are a leading source of decoherence, can have relaxation times longer than the qubits themselves. However, the standard techniques used to characterize qubit relaxation is only valid for measuring $T_1$ under Markovian assumptions and could mask such non-Markovian behavior of the environment in practice. Here, we introduce two-timescale relaxometry, a technique to probe the qubit and environment relaxation simultaneously and efficiently. We apply it to high-coherence fluxonium qubits over a frequency range of 0.1-0.4 GHz, which reveals a discrete spectrum of TLS with millisecond lifetimes. Our analysis of the spectrum is consistent with a random distribution of TLS in the aluminum oxide tunnel barrier of the Josephson junction chain of the fluxonium with an average density and electric dipole similar to previous TLS studies at much higher frequencies. Our study suggests that investigating and mitigating TLS in the junction chain is crucial to the development of various types of noise-protected qubits in circuit QED.</p>

            <h2>First passage times in compact domains exhibit bi-scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Talia Baravi, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai</p>
            <p>The study of first passage times for diffusing particles reaching target states is foundational in various practical applications, including diffusion-controlled reactions. In this work, we present a bi-scaling theory for the probability density function of first passage times in confined compact processes, applicable to both Euclidean and Fractal domains, diverse geometries, and scenarios with or without external force fields, accommodating Markovian and semi-Markovian random walks. In large systems, first passage time statistics exhibit a bi-scaling behavior, challenging the use of a single time scale. Our theory employs two distinct scaling functions: one for short times, capturing initial dynamics in unbounded systems, and the other for long times is sensitive to finite size effects. The combined framework provides a complete expression for first passage time statistics across all time scales.</p>

            <h2>Energy Window Augmented Plane Waves (EWAPW)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Garry Goldstein</p>
            <p>In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structure calculations of crystalline solids aimed at applications to Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In this construction we take advantage of the fact that most DFT calculations use a convergence loop in order to obtain the eigenstates of a final Khon Sham (KS) Hamiltonian matrix - that is iterate solve the KS equations till the eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian matrix also give the appropriate electron density needed to obtain the KS potential needed for that KS Hamiltonian matrix. Here we propose that, for the basis used at each step of the iteration, we use the previous eigenstate basis, in the interstitial region, but augmented inside the Muffin Tin (MT) sphere with the solution to the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian for the energy window of the energy of that eigenstate. Indeed to reduce the number of times the spherically averaged KS potential needs to be solved inside the MT spheres it is advantageous to use energy windows and solve the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian inside the MT region only once per window (at the energy relevant to that window) so that the spherically averaged KS Hamiltonian needs only be solved a small number of times per iteration of the solution of the KS equations. For practical applications it is reasonable to have on the order of ten to one hundred windows. This method combines the implicit energy dependence of the basis of methods such as Projected Augmented Wave functions (PAW) with the ability of the basis set to adjust to the solid state (rather then atomic) environment which is similar to basis sets such as Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (LAPW). At each step of the iteration of the solution of the KS equations the basis is that of near eigenstates of the KS Hamiltonian for that iteration.</p>

            <p>Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.</p>

            <p>We present a novel approach to generate a fingerprint for crystalline materials that balances efficiency for machine processing and human interpretability, allowing its application in both machine learning inference and understanding of structure-property relationships. Our proposed material encoding has two components: one representing the crystal structure and the other characterizing the chemical composition, that we call Pettifor embedding. For the latter we construct a non-orthogonal space where each axis represents a chemical element and where the angle between the axes quantifies a measure of the similarity between them. The chemical composition is then defined by the point on the unit sphere in this non-orthogonal space. We show that the Pettifor embeddings systematically outperform other commonly used elemental embeddings in compositional machine learning models. Using the Pettifor embeddings to define a distance metric and applying dimension reduction techniques, we construct a two-dimensional global map of the space of thermodynamically stable crystalline compounds. Despite their simplicity, such maps succeed in providing a physical separation of material classes according to basic physical properties.</p>

We list the possible experiment parameter settings for different isotopes and discuss their experimental feasibility. With the assumption of a rigid monopole-vortex structure, we analytically predict the vortex trajectory in an external magnetic field. We then confirm the result by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which employs two gauges simultaneously (the Wu-Yang approach) to prevent singularity in the one-gauge method when a monopole is present. The study offers significant insight into the characteristics of monopoles and vortices, facilitating avenues for experimental validation.</p>

            <p>To study the size and strain rate dependency of copper polycrystalline microstructures, a multi-layered copper/Al$_2$O$_3$ thin film was deposited on a Si substrate using a hybrid deposition system (combining physical vapour and atomic layer deposition). High temperature treatment was applied on the ``As Deposited" material with ultrafine-grained structure to increase the average grain size, resulting in a ``Heat Treated" state with microcrystalline structure. Focused ion beam milling was employed to create square shaped micropillars with two different sizes, that were subjected to compressive loading at various (0.001/s -- 1000/s) strain rates. Differences in the strain rate sensitivity behavior manifesting at low and high strain rates are discussed in the context of the pillar diameters and the grain size of the deformed samples. The Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayer studied by transmission electron microscopy showed excellent thermal stability and grain boundary pinning by precipitation, also resulting in the homogeneous deformation of the pillars and preventing shear localization. Geometrically necessary dislocation densities estimated by high (angular) resolution electron backscatter diffraction presented inhomogeneous dislocation distribution within the deformed pillar volumes, that is attributed to the proximity of the sample edges. Finally, the Al$_2$O$_3$ interlayers successfully suppressed any possible recrystallization processes, contributing to the excellent film stability, that makes the proposed coating ideal to be operating under extreme conditions.</p>

We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Foligno, Bruno Bertini</p>
            <p>The growth of the entanglement between two disjoint intervals and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits on qubits and for a large family of dual-unitary circuits on qudits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.</p>

            <p>In systems with unconventional Rashba bands, we propose that a finite-momentum pairing state can emerge without the need for an external magnetic field. We analyze the phase transition from a zero-momentum Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to a finite-momentum pairing state using a microscopic interaction model. We demonstrate that the coexistence of zero-momentum and Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type pairings in different channels provides a well understanding of recent experimental observations of pair-density-wave (PDW) states. Furthermore, we propose that an s-wave BCS superconductor-unconventional Rashba metal (SC-URM) junction can generate an LO-type pairing state via an orbital-selective proximity effect. This nontrivial state can be detected by measuring the Josephson current in an SC-URM-SC junction or through Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy/spectrosscopy (JSTM/S). Our results reveal that the internal multi-orbital degrees of freedom play a crucial role in facilitating finite-momentum pairing states.</p>

Flux creep is a phenomenon observed under the assumption that the material under study can trap magnetic flux, and thus, Fig. 4c serves as evidence that H$_{3}$S traps magnetic flux and is a high-temperature superconductor. The claim remains unchanged even in the recently published Author Correction [2] to Ref. [1]. However, Ref.

In this Matters Arising, we point out that the protocol is not applicable to H$_{3}$S under high pressure and propose an alternative protocol.

Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allow one to reconcile experimental angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at moderate computational cost.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative Theory for Critical Conditions of Like-Charge Attraction Between Polarizable Spheres</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanyu Duan, Zecheng Gan</p>
            <p>Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, a concise quantitative theory to predict the occurrence of like-charge attraction (LCA) between polarizable spheres remains elusive. In this work, we first derive a novel three-point image formula, based on a key observation that connects the classical Neumann's image principle with the incomplete beta function. This approach naturally yields simple yet precise critical conditions for LCA, with a relative discrepancy of less than $1\%$ compared to numerical simulations, validated across diverse parameter settings. The obtained critical conditions may provide physical insights into various processes potentially involving LCA, such as self-assembly, crystallization, and phase separation across different length scales. Additionally, the new image formula is directly applicable to enhance the efficiency of polarizable force field calculations involving polarizable spheres.</p>

            <h2>Speedups in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation: Mpemba and related effects</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gianluca Teza, John Bechhoefer, Antonio Lasanta, Oren Raz, Marija Vucelja</p>
            <p>Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry Analysis of the Non-Hermitian Electro-Optic Effect in Crystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sylvain Lannebère, Tatiana G. Rappoport, Tiago A. Morgado, Ivo Souza, Mário G. Silveirinha</p>
            <p>Here, we investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect arising from the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the point group symmetry, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.</p>

            <h2>Magneto-rotation coupling for ferromagnetic nanoelement embedded in elastic substrate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos</p>
            <p>This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the in-plane applied magnetic field. We found that in the absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field decreases with a reduction in the thickness-to-width ratio of the strip for a Rayleigh wave, whereas for a Love wave, it changes non-monotonically. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.</p>

            <h2>Anti Kibble-Zurek behavior in the quantum XY spin-1/2 chain driven by correlated noisy magnetic field and anisotropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Sadeghizade, R. Jafari, A. Langari</p>
            <p>In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.</p>

            <p>Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we evaluate the local magnetic moments and Mössbauer properties for Fe-based intermetallic compounds and employ machine learning to map the local crystalline environments to such properties. It is observed that magnetic moments and Mössbauer parameters provide complementary insights into the local crystalline environment, where the statistical features cannot be captured using phenomenological models. Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes. This work advances the mapping of local crystalline structures to magnetic and spectroscopic properties, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Ferrini, S.V. Koniakhin</p>
            <p>The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</p>

            <p>We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered Critical Spin Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</p>

            <p>We show that energy dissipation in slowly-driven, Markovian quantum systems at low temperature is linked to the geometry of the driving protocol through the quantum (or Fubini-Study) metric. Utilizing these findings, we establish lower bounds on dissipation rates in two-tone protocols, such as those employed for topological frequency conversion. Notably, in appropriate limits these bounds are only determined by the topology of the protocol and an effective quality factor of the system-bath coupling. Our results bridge topological and geometric phenomena with energy dissipation in open quantum systems, and further provide design principles for optimal driving protocols.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, despite being an idealization of real flows, is of fundamental interest as a model of the spontaneous emergence of order from chaotic flows. The emergence of order often displays critical behavior, whose study is hindered by the long spatial and temporal scales involved. Here, we experimentally study turbulence in periodically driven nanofluidic channels with a high aspect ratio using superfluid helium. We find a multistable transition behavior resulting from cascading bifurcations of large-scale vorticity and critical behavior at the transition to quasi-2D turbulence consistent with phase transitions in periodically driven many-body systems. We demonstrate that quasi-2D turbulent systems can undergo an abrupt change in response to a small change in a control parameter, consistent with predictions for large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.</p>

            <p>The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.</p>

            <p>The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need of additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Krylov complexity of Schrödinger field theories, focusing on both bosonic and fermionic systems within the grand canonical ensemble that includes a chemical potential. Krylov complexity measures operator growth in quantum systems by analyzing how operators spread within the Krylov space, a subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by successive applications of the superoperator $[H,\cdot]$ on an initial operator. Using the Lanczos algorithm, we construct an orthonormal Krylov basis and derive the Lanczos coefficients, which govern the operator connectivity and thus characterize the complexity. Our study reveals that the Lanczos coefficients $\{b_{n}\}$ are independent of the chemical potential, while $\{a_{n}\}$ exhibits a dependence on it. Both $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ show linear relationships with respect to $n$. For both bosonic and fermionic systems, the Krylov complexities behave similarly over time, especially at late times, due to the analogous profiles of the squared absolute values of their autocorrelation functions $\abs{\varphi_{0}(t)}^{2}$. The Krylov complexity grows exponentially with time, but its asymptotic scaling factor $\lambda_{K}$ is significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of the $\{b_{n}\}$ coefficients, contrasting to the relativistic field theories where the scaling aligns more closely with the twice of the slope of $\{b_{n}\}$.</p>

            <p>Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</p>

            <p>Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</p>

The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.</p>

            <p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a pivotal method within quantum chemistry and materials science, with its core involving the construction and solution of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18%.

            <h2>The nonlinear limit of Babinet's Principle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentin Dichtl, Thorsten Schumacher, Markus Lippitz</p>
            <p>Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Higher-Order Topological Insulator via Floquet Engineering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chun-Ping Su, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>Higher-order topological insulators have attracted significant interest in both static single-particle and many-body lattice systems. While periodically driven (Floquet) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in such systems remains less understood. In this paper, we extend previous studies by investigating interaction-induced higher-order topological phases through Floquet engineering. To achieve this, we construct an extended Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice subjected to periodic driving. We demonstrate the emergence of interaction-induced normal Floquet second-order topological corner states for doublons (i.e., bound boson pairs) from a trivial phase, which exhibit robustness against disorder. Notably, beyond the normal phase, we reveal an interaction-induced anomalous Floquet second-order topological phase, where in-gap corner states of doublons emerge within the $\pi/T$ gap ($T$ being the driving period). Our model, accessible with state-of-the-art ultracold atom techniques, provides a platform for realizing interaction-driven higher-order topological phases uniquely enabled by periodic driving, with no direct counterparts in static or single-particle systems.</p>

            <h2>Floquet non-Abelian topological charges and edge states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxin Pan, Longwen Zhou</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Robust strong-field theory model for ultrafast electron transport through metal-insulator-metal tunneling nanojunctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Boyang Ma, Michael Krüger</p>
            <p>Ultrafast science studies the dynamics of electrons in matter with extreme temporal precision, typically in the attosecond and femtosecond time domain. Recent experimental and theoretical progress has put metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunneling nanojunctions in the spotlight of ultrafast science. Waveform-controlled laser fields can induce ultrafast currents in these junctions, opening the door to petahertz electronic operation and attosecond-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Inspired by our strong-field model for attosecond tunneling microscopy [Boyang Ma and Michael Krüger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236901 (2024)], here we generalize our model to MIM nanojunctions. We introduce several refinements and corrections, accounting for the image potential inside the gap and boundary effects. Moreover, we also find that the Keldysh parameter alone is insufficient for describing the physics in thin MIM nanojunctions. We introduce a new parameter $\zeta$ that accounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide several interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex physics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for $\zeta > 1$ photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport across the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one or more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling through the barrier. $\zeta < 1$ is required for a regime in which the laser field and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the three-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic regime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons and the carrier-envelope phase control of the net current. Our theory model provides a rich toolbox for understanding and predicting the physics of ultrafast MIM nanojunctions.</p>

            <h2>Terahertz radiation generation by laser-resonant excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons on a graphene-n-InSb semiconductor interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Kumar Srivastav, Mrityunjay Kundu</p>
            <p>We propose a method for the laser-excitation of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons via the linear mode conversion of terahertz radiation on a graphene sheet deposited on an n-type semiconductor in presence of an external magnetic field parallel to the semiconductor surface. An obliquely incident p-polarized laser beam interacting with the graphene n-InSb semiconductor surface, imparts linear oscillatory velocity to the free electrons. This oscillatory velocity couples with the modulated electron density to generate a linear current density, which resonantly excites terahertz surface magnetoplasmons. It is shown that the amplitude of terahertz surface magnetoplasmons wave can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field ($\text{B}_{0}$), the graphene's Fermi energy ($\text{E}_\text{F}$), the semiconductor's temperature (T), and the incident angle ($\theta$) of laser. This mechanism has the potential to enable the development of an actively tunable plasmonic device.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting nonlinear Hall effect induced by geometric phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji</p>
            <p>We study the nonlinear Hall effect in superconductors without magnetic fields induced by a quantum geometric phase (i.e., the Aharonov-Bohm phase) carried by single or pair particles. We find that the second-order nonlinear Hall conductivity diverges in the dc limit in a robust way against dissipation when the system is superconducting, suggesting that the supercurrent flows perpendicular to the direction of the applied electric field. This superconducting nonlinear Hall effect (SNHE) is demonstrated for the Haldane model with attractive interaction and its variant with pair hoppings. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the SNHE can be understood as those arising from a higher-order Lifshitz invariant, that is, a symmetry invariant constructed from order parameters that contains an odd number of spatial derivatives. We perform real-time simulations including the effect of collective modes for the models driven by a multi-cycle pulse, and show that the SNHE leads to large rectification of the Hall current under light driving.</p>

            <p>Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-ångström and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateusz Dyksik, Michal Baranowski, Joshua J. P. Thompson, Zhuo Yang, Martha Rivera Medina, Maria Antonietta Loi, Ermin Malic, Paulina Plochocka</p>
            <p>A comprehensive study of excitonic properties of 2D layered perovskites is provided, with an emphasis on understanding and controlling the exciton fine structure. First, an overview of the optical properties is presented, discussing the challenges in determining the bandgap and exciton binding energies. Through magneto-optical spectroscopic measurements (up to B = 140 T), scaling laws are established for exciton binding energy as a function of the band gap and the diamagnetic coefficient. Using an in-plane magnetic field, the exciton fine structure for various 2D perovskites is examined to measure the energy splitting between the excitonic levels. The exciton fine structure and exchange interaction are correlated with structural parameters, employing an effective mass model, to highlight the role of steric effect on the exchange interaction. These findings reveal that lattice distortions, introduced by organic spacers, significantly influence the exchange interaction, driving a tunable energy spacing between dark and bright excitons. This unique feature of 2D perovskites, not present in other semiconductors, offers a novel tuning mechanism for exciton control, making these materials highly promising for efficient light emitters and advanced quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kimo Pressler, Daniel R. Gamelin</p>
            <p>Excitons in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer unique windows into the properties of strongly correlated electrons. Their generation can be used to drive magnetic phase transitions, manipulate spins coherently, or access novel non-equilibrium regimes. Despite extensive investigation into the spin physics of CrI3, exciton dynamics in this archetypal magnetic 2D material remain underexplored. Here, we report the use of Yb3+ impurity point defects as exciton annihilators to probe exciton diffusion in CrI3. Variable-temperature photoluminescence (PL) measurements for a series of x% Yb3+:CrI3 samples reveal thermally activated Dexter-type site-to-site hopping of excitons, with low exciton diffusivity associated with strong electron-nuclear coupling. Using Monte Carlo modeling calibrated by the experimental data, diffusivities are found to be orders of magnitudes lower than in 2D vdW semiconductors. Exciton diffusion lengths (LD) are below ~3 nm at all temperatures, and thus well below the optical diffraction limit. These results have basic implications for the use of excitons to probe and manipulate their surroundings in this and related magnetic CrX3 materials.</p>

            <p>This study presents SALMON VR, a visualization program designed to visualize the time evolution of electronic density changes and vector potentials in virtual reality (VR) space. The time-series electronic density data computed by SALMON are stored in CUBE format. SALMON VR processes these data to construct isosurfaces of electronic density variations and two-dimensional representations of vector potentials. Equipped with a user-friendly interface using VR technology, the program is available in two versions: one for the Meta Quest 3 head-mount display (Meta Platforms Inc., California) and one for PCs. Atoms are displayed as spheres of different sizes and colors according to their elemental properties. This visual representation facilitates a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between light and electrons. Users can easily manipulate the isosurface values, speed of animation, and color map of the vector potential.

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate strong magnon-magnon coupling by thermal spin excitations in yttrium iron garnet/permalloy (YIG/Py) hybrid structures using microfocused Brillouin light scattering - an optical technique that enables the detection of zero-wavevector and higher-order wavevector spin waves in a broad frequency range. The thermally activated magnons in the bilayer lead to a hybrid excitation between magnon modes in the conductive Py layer with a wide wavevector range and the first perpendicular standing magnon modes in the insulating YIG layer, facilitated by strong interfacial exchange coupling. To further investigate this coupling, we compare the thermal magnon spectra with the results obtained from electrical excitation and detection methods, which primarily detect the uniform Py mode. The realization of coherent coupling between incoherent (thermal) magnons is important for advancing energy-efficient magnonic devices, particularly in classical as well as quantum spin-wave computing technologies.</p>

The chemical foundation model is fine-tuned on an experimental dataset of 13,666 ionic conductivity values curated from the lithium-ion battery literature. The fine-tuned model is used to discover 7 novel high conductivity electrolyte formulations through generative screening, improving the conductivity of LiFSI and LiDFOB based electrolytes by 82% and 172%, respectively. These findings highlight a generalizable workflow that is highly adaptable to the discovery of chemical mixtures with tailored properties to address challenges in energy storage and beyond.</p>

            <p>Elucidating mechanical deformation in glassy materials at the atomic level is challenging due to their disordered atomic structure. Using our novel "frozen atom analysis," we reveal that anelastic deformation in CuZr metallic glasses is fundamentally driven by cooperative atomic motions of approximately 40 elastically linked atoms, forming trigger groups. They initiate localized rearrangements, which can cascade into plastic flow. Notably, these groups show no distinct structural or physical features, challenging the idea that deformation occurs in defective regions. Instead, deformation events are highly stochastic and transient, driven by collective atomic motion. This finding not only reshapes our understanding of glassy material deformation mechanisms but also highlights cooperative motion as a key factor in avalanche-like phenomena governing the behavior of disordered systems across multiple scales.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riccardo Reho, Arnold H. Kole, Nils Wittemeier, Andrés R. Botello-Méndez, Zeila Zanolli</p>
            <p>We investigate the superconducting properties of monolayer FeSe, both freestanding (ML FeSe) and on SrTiO$_3$ (STO), by simultaneously solving the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations. Our results demonstrate that the substrate profoundly alters both the normal-state and superconducting properties of FeSe. We identify proximity-induced superconductivity in the interfacial TiO$_2$ layer of STO, due to hybridization between Fe $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. This hybridization results in a fivefold increase in the superconducting gap width and confines superconducting states to the $M$ point in the Brillouin Zone. This is in contrast to ML FeSe, where superconductivity emerges at both the $\Gamma$ and $M$ points. Furthermore, the substrate modifies the orbital character of the states responsible for superconductivity, which change from Fe $d_{z^2}$ in ML FeSe to Fe $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ in FeSe/STO. In both systems, we demonstrate an anisotropic superconducting gap with multiple coherence peaks, originating at different k-points in the Brillouin Zone. Additionally, in FeSe/STO, we identify emerging states unique to the superconducting phase arising from electron-hole hybridization at $M$, in agreement with experiments. Our findings highlight the decisive impact of substrate (hybridization, strain, charge transfer, magnetic order) on the superconducting properties of FeSe. We suggest potential pathways for engineering novel high-temperature FeSe-based superconductors by leveraging interfacial interactions in substrates with high electron affinity.</p>

            <p>By using the exact Bethe wavefunctions of the one-dimensional Hubbard model with $N$ spin-up fermions and one spin-down impurity, we derive an analytic expression of the impurity form factor, in the form of a determinant of a $(N+1)$ by $(N+1)$ matrix. This analytic expression enables us to exactly calculate spectral properties of one-dimensional Fermi polarons in lattices, when the masses of the impurity particle and the Fermi bath are equal. We present the impurity spectral function as functions of the on-site interaction strength and the filling factor of the Fermi bath, and discuss the origin of Fermi singularities in the spectral function at small momentum and the emergence of polaron quasiparticles at large momentum near the boundary of Brillouin zone. Our analytic expression of the impurity form factors pave the way to exploring the intriguing dynamics of a particle interacting with a Fermi bath. Our exact predictions on the impurity spectral function could be directly examined in cold-atom laboratories by using the radio-frequency spectroscopy and Ramsey spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>We study the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in an Ising superconductor with broken basal mirror symmetry in a parallel magnetic field. We show that in the presence of a small Rashba spin splitting, $\Delta_R$, the dominant Ising spin-orbit coupling ($\Delta_I >> \Delta_R$) dramatically enhances the SDE efficiency compared to a Rashba superconductor with $\Delta_I = 0$ and the same $\Delta_R$. The suppression of the SDE for $\Delta_I = 0$ at $\Delta_R$ much larger than the critical temperature ($T_c$) is accidental. At $\Delta_R << T_c$, the SDE efficiency is small because, to linear order, $\Delta_R$ can be removed by a gauge transformation. These two factors -- the accidental suppression of the SDE at large $\Delta_R$ and the systematic suppression at small $\Delta_R$ -- are eliminated by Ising spin-orbit coupling. As a result, SDE efficiency is substantially enhanced for $\Delta_I >> \Delta_R \neq 0$.</p>

            <p>The surface tunneling microscope (STM) method probes the itinerant conduction electron spectrum which is influenced by the presence of collective order parameters. It may in fact be used as a tool to obtain important information about their microscopic nature, for example the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. Surprisingly it has been found that the STM spectrum can also identify magnetic order of completely localised electrons, e.g., incommensurate helical structure of 4f electron moments, as observed in the compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. This is due to the fact that the exchange coupling of conduction states to the localised subsystem reconstructs the itinerant bands which then leaves an imprint on the STM spectrum. We develop a theory based on this idea that shows firstly the appearance of STM satellite peaks at the wave vector of localised moment helical order for the pure surface. Secondly we derive the quasiparticle interference spectrum in Born approximation due to the presence of surface impurities which contains information on the reconstruction process of itinerant states caused by the localised helical order. Furthermore we show that within full $t$-matrix approach impurity bound states are also influenced by the exchange coupling to helical magnetic order.</p>

            <p>Magnetic or electrical manipulation of electronic spin is elementary for spin-based logic, computing, and memory, where the latter is a low-power manipulation scheme. Rashba-like spin splittings stemming from spin-orbit interaction (SOI) enable electric-field manipulation of spin, but the relativistic SOI causes spin relaxations and yields dissipative transport of spin-encoded information. Recent works suggest the occurrence of electric-field switchable non-relativistic Zeeman spin splittings (NRZSSs) in collinear antiferromagnets -- allowing for electrical manipulation of spin in the non-relativistic regime; yet, a theory elucidating the mechanisms for these NRZSSs and guiding the materials discovery remains missing. Here, we develop such a theory by analyzing the symmetries of spin point groups. We highlight the linear magnetoelectric and bilinear piezomagnetoelectric mechanisms for NRZSSs that depend linearly on electric field and are electrically switchable. First-principles calculations further confirm that LiMnPO$_4$ and NaMnP showcase such NRZSSs. Our theory provides guidelines for discovering light-element collinear antiferromagnets with electrically switchable NRZSSs, which are promising for the design of high-performance spin-based devices.</p>

            <h2>Controlled Diagonal Catalyst Improves the Efficiency of Quantum Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Hattori, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the runtime required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales is inverse to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy to improve the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains challenging. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate square speed up in time-to-solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.</p>

            <p>This work develops an analytical model to consistently interpret the steady-state and small-perturbation response (both in the time and frequency domain) of photoanodes for solar water-splitting. In addition to accounting for the fundamental mechanisms of charge-carrier generation, recombination and slow hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, the model overcomes the key shortcomings of existing models in the literature. These include consistency across measurements/bias conditions and the non-consideration of imperfect electron extraction at the collecting contact and its corresponding effect on the recombination rate in the bulk. We applied the model to analyse the time constants obtained from intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage (IMVS) measurements of a hematite photoanode, obtaining an electron extraction velocity of 100 cm/s close to the 1 sun open-circuit potential, that corresponds to an electron mobility of 0.022 cm2V-1s-1. The model further predicts a linear dependence of the photocurrent versus anodic voltage, an observation whose origin has been strongly debated in the literature in the case of hematite photoanodes. The generality of the model allows its extension to other photoanodes and photovoltaic systems, by the addition or removal of specific physical mechanisms.</p>

We report on the effects of temperature and external magnetic field on Raman-active phonons of $A_g$ symmetry in bulk and one-to-six-layer forms of CrSBr that are reflected by the Raman spectral patterns measured at different configurations of circularly polarized laser beam. The results of experimental investigations reveal that spin-spin and spin-phonon interactions play a significant role below the Néel temperature and are notably stronger in CrSBr monolayer than in bulk material. Spin-phonon coupling leads to the emergence of \textit{ new} phonon peaks at very low temperatures. Such effect is solely observed in one-to-six-layer CrSBr and is absent in its bulk form. Our experimental research is accompanied by \textit{ab initio} simulations of the Raman spectra of bulk and monolayer CrSBr that uncover correlations between intensities of Raman-active phonons and the arrangement of spin magnetic moments on Cr atoms. Comparative analysis of simulated and experimental Raman spectra suggests the most favored spin orientation in the CrSBr antiferromagnetic system.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskites are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, exhibiting high power conversion efficiency due to strong light absorption and long carrier diffusion lengths. While various aspects of their crystal and electronic structure have been studied, we identify a fundamental property previously overlooked that may significantly impact their efficiency. We demonstrate that halide perovskites realize a three-dimensional (3D) Lieb lattice, giving rise to a gapped 3D Dirac cone of spin-1 fermions. This leads to a fivefold reduction in effective mass compared to a conventional cubic structure and suppressed carrier backscattering due to Klein tunneling. Our conclusions are supported by band structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy from CsPbBr$_3$ and CsSnBr$_3$. In particular, we reveal the transformation of the flat band of the Lieb lattice and the emergence of a dark corridor effect in photoemission from the Dirac cone, which increases as the band gap is decreased from CsPbBr$_3$ to CsSnBr$_3$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elena Agliari, Alberto Fachechi, Domenico Luongo</p>
            <p>We consider Hopfield networks, where neurons interact pair-wise by Hebbian couplings built over $i$. a set of definite patterns (ground truths), $ii$. a sample of labeled examples (supervised setting), $iii$. a sample of unlabeled examples (unsupervised setting). We focus on the case where ground-truths are Rademacher vectors and examples are noisy versions of these ground-truths, possibly displaying some blank entries (e.g., mimicking missing or dropped data), and we determine the spectral distribution of the coupling matrices in the three scenarios, by exploiting and extending the Marchenko-Pastur theorem. By levering this knowledge, we are able to analytically inspect the stability and attractiveness of the ground truths, as well as the generalization capabilities of the networks. In particular, as corroborated by long-running Monte Carlo simulations, the presence of black entries can have benefits in some specific conditions, suggesting strategies based on data sparsification; the robustness of these results in structured datasets is confirmed numerically. Finally, we demonstrate that the Hebbian matrix, built on sparse examples, can be recovered as the fixed point of a gradient descent algorithm with dropout, over a suitable loss function.</p>

            <p>We investigate the necessary features of the pair interaction for the stabilization of self-assembled quantum quasicrystals in two-dimensional bosonic systems. Unlike the classical scenario, our results show that two-dimensional octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal aperiodic phases require a distinct number of properly tuned characteristic length scales for their stabilization. By using a mean field spectral variational approach and Gross-Pitaevskii numerical calculations, we determine that the dodecagonal quasicrystal structure requires at least two characteristic length scales for its stabilization, while the decagonal and octagonal patterns need at least three and four length scales, respectively. The family of pair interaction potentials considered, albeit simple, is well justified in terms of a novel experimental platform based on laser-painted interactions in a cavity QED setup. Finally, we perform a structural characterization of the quasicrystal patterns obtained and show that these phases coexist with a finite superfluid fraction, forming what can be called a super quasicrystal phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seongyu Park, Xavier Durang, Ralf Metzler, Jae-Hyung Jeon</p>
            <p>Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in various biological and soft matter systems. This anomalous dynamics is typically attributed to heterogeneous environments inducing spatiotemporal variations in the diffusivity of tracer particles. While previous studies have predominantly focused on systems exhibiting either spatial or temporal heterogeneity, this work bridges the gap by introducing a model based on an annealed extreme landscape to simultaneously account for both types of heterogeneities. Through a combination of computational analyses and analytical derivations, we investigate how the interplay of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the energy landscape gives rise to Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of temporal environmental fluctuations, the heterogeneous diffusion inevitably converges to classical Brownian motion via a homogenization process. We derive an analytical expression for the homogenization time as a function of key parameters governing the system's spatiotemporal heterogeneities. Additionally, we quantify particle-to-particle diffusion heterogeneity and examine the ergodic properties of this model, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of complex, heterogeneous systems.</p>

            <p>The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</p>

            <p>The Perpendicular Shape Anisotropy Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (PSA-STT-MRAM) is a recent concept proposed to maintain the thermal stability of standard MRAM at small diameters, considering thick vertical pillars as the free layer. In order to explore the specific physics of PSA-STT-MRAMs expected in relation with their three-dimensional nature, we have performed simulations combining a micromagnetic model coupled self-consistently with spin-dependent transport equations. The 3D shape induces flower states at the upper and lower surfaces. Besides, the field-like component of STT is found to be larger than in standard MRAMs, suggesting that it needs to be considered. The combination of both effects leads to the excitation of high-order 3D ferromagnetic resonance modes, playing a key role in magnetisation reversal. These results highlight features of 3D nanomagnetic systems, largely disregarded so far, which need to be considered to optimise PSA-STT-MRAM to be a competitive solution for technological implementation.</p>

            <p>In solid acid solid electrolytes CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, mechanisms of fast proton conduction have long been debated and attributed to either local proton hopping or polyanion rotation. However, the precise role of polyanion rotation and its interplay with proton hopping remained unclear. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, driven by equivariant neural network force fields, reveal a nuanced proton slingshot mechanism: protons are initially carried by rotating polyanions, followed by O$-$H bond reorientation, and the combined motion enables long-range jumps. This challenges the conventional revolving paddlewheel model and reveals significant independent proton motion that is assisted by limited rotations. Despite structural similarities, we identify qualitative differences in transport mechanisms between CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, caused by different proton concentrations. CsH$_2$PO$_4$ exhibits two distinct rates of rotational motions with different activation energies, contrasting with CsHSO$_4$'s single-rate behavior. The higher proton concentration in CsH$_2$PO$_4$ correlates with frustrated PO$_4$ polyanion orientations and slower rotations compared to SO$_4$ in CsHSO$_4$. Additionally, we reveal a correlation between O-sharing and proton transport in CsH$_2$PO$_4$, a unique feature due to extra proton per polyanion compared to CsHSO$_4$. Our findings suggest that reducing proton concentration could accelerate rotations and enhance conductivity. This work provides a unified framework for understanding and optimizing ionic mobility in solid-acid compounds, offering new insights into the interplay between proton hopping and disordered dynamics in polyanion rotation.</p>

            <h2>Particle Pairing Caused Subdiffusion of Heavy Particles in the Imbalanced Hubbard Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mirko Daumann, Thomas Dahm</p>
            <p>The imbalanced Hubbard model features a transition between dynamic regimes depending on the mass ratio and coupling strength between two different particle species. A slowdown of the lighter particle transport can be attributed to an emergent effective disorder induced by the heavy particles for high mass ratio and strong coupling. This subdiffusive regime has been interpreted as a Griffiths phase, linking the effect to the coexistence of metallic and insulating regions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the heavy particles, which also reveals subdiffusive behavior, yet cannot be explained within the Griffiths picture. We demonstrate that heavy particles predominantly form small clusters, mainly pairs, during the dynamical process, which reduces their propagation speed and transiently shifts the time-dependent diffusion constant into the subdiffusive regime at late times. The necessary attraction between particles driving this process can be understood within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We introduce a classical one-dimensional random walk model that can quantitatively reproduce the subdiffusion dynamics in the strong coupling regime.</p>

            <h2>Mechanism of Shape Symmetry Breaking in Surfactant Mediated Crystal Growth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sam Oaks-Leaf, David T. Limmer</p>
            <p>We present a dynamical model of crystal growth, in which it is possible to reliably achieve asymmetric products, beginning from symmetric initial conditions and growing within an isotropic environment. The asymmetric growth is the result of a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the effect of thermal fluctuations in the coverage of surfactants on the growing crystalline facets. Within our simple model, we are able to understand the kinetic and thermodynamic factors involved in both the onset of symmetry breaking and the persistence of anisotropic growth. We demonstrate that the mechanism is general by studying models with increasing complexity. We argue that this mechanism of symmetry breaking underpins observations of colloidal, seed-mediated syntheses of single crystalline metal nanorods capped with strongly interacting surfactants. The parameters within our model are related to experimental observables such as the concentration, hydrophobicity, and binding strength of the surfactants, which suggests a potential route to optimize the yield of asymmetric products in colloidal nanoparticle syntheses.</p>

            <p>Twisted layered van-der-Waals materials often exhibit unique electronic and optical properties absent in their non-twisted counterparts. Unfortunately, predicting such properties is hindered by the difficulty in determining the atomic structure in materials displaying large moiré domains. Here, we introduce a split machine-learned interatomic potential and dataset curation approach that separates intralayer and interlayer interactions and significantly improves model accuracy -- with a tenfold increase in energy and force prediction accuracy relative to conventional models. We further demonstrate that traditional MLIP validation metrics -- force and energy errors -- are inadequate for moiré structures and develop a more holistic, physically-motivated metric based on the distribution of stacking configurations. This metric effectively compares the entirety of large-scale moiré domains between two structures instead of relying on conventional measures evaluated on smaller commensurate cells. Finally, we establish that one-dimensional instead of two-dimensional moiré structures can serve as efficient surrogate systems for validating MLIPs, allowing for a practical model validation protocol against explicit DFT calculations. Applying our framework to HfS2/GaS bilayers reveals that accurate structural predictions directly translate into reliable electronic properties. Our model-agnostic approach integrates seamlessly with various intralayer and interlayer interaction models, enabling computationally tractable relaxation of moiré materials, from bilayer to complex multilayers, with rigorously validated accuracy.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity emerging from a time-reversal symmetry-breaking normal state in tetralayer rhombohedral graphene, we here investigate superconducting instabilities in this system. We classify the possible pairing instabilities, including states with commensurate and incommensurate center of mass momenta. As rotational symmetry is broken in the latter type of pairing states, their momentum-space structure is most naturally characterized by a "valley-independent Chern number", measuring the relative chirality between the normal and superconducting state. We further demonstrate that superconductivity can condense at multiple incommensurate momenta simultaneously, leading to the spontaneous formation of a translational-symmetry-breaking superlattice superconductor. Studying multiple different pairing mechanisms and varying the degree of spin and valley polarization in the normal state, we compare the energetics of these superconductors. Our results demonstrate that valley-imbalanced rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can give rise to rich superconducting phenomenologies.</p>

            <p>We investigate the wetting transitions displayed by the collection of active Brownian particles (ABPs) confined within rigid, impenetrable, flat walls. In our computational study using Brownian dynamics simulations, the wall-particle interactions are implemented with a short-range repulsive potential. An enhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for wetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes complete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe a sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational diffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW), partial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we compute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise. Our analysis indicates that these transitions are linked to enhanced kinetic energy fluctuations of particles and bubble formations in the dense state. We further characterize the nature of these transitions by systematically analyzing an order parameter. Our work shows that modifying local reorientation rates alone is sufficient to induce wetting transitions in active systems.</p>

            <p>In this manuscript we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</p>

            <p>Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.</p>

            <p>A lossy quantum system harboring the non-Hermitian skin effect can in certain conditions exhibit anomalously high loss at the boundaries of the system compared to the bulk, a phenomenon termed the non-Hermitian edge burst. We uncover interacting many-body extensions of the edge burst that are spatially extended and patterned, as well as cluster bursts that occur away from boundaries. Owing to the methodological difficulty and overhead of accurately realizing non-Hermitian dynamical evolution, much less tunable interactions, few experimental avenues in studying the single-particle edge burst have been reported to date and none for many-body variants. We overcome these roadblocks in this study, and present a realization of edge and cluster bursts in an interacting quantum ladder model on a superconducting quantum processor. We utilize a time-stepping algorithm, which implements time-evolution by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians by composing a linear combination of unitaries scheme and product formulae, to assess long-time behavior of the system. We observe signatures of the non-Hermitian edge burst on up to 64 unit cells, and detect the closing of the dissipative gap, a necessary condition for the edge burst, by probing the imaginary spectrum of the system. In suitable interacting regimes, we identify the emergence of spatial patterning and cluster bursts. Beyond establishing these generalized forms of edge burst phenomena, our study paves the way for digital quantum processors to be harnessed as a versatile platform for non-Hermitian condensed-matter physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yahui Li, Pablo Sala, Frank Pollmann, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei Motrunich</p>
            <p>Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.</p>

Our method enables independent control of the moments associated with charge and spin transfer, allowing for the enhancement of spin current with minimal charge current or the independent tuning of spin and charge fluctuations.

            <p>Trapped magnetic vortices in niobium can introduce microwave losses in superconducting devices, affecting both niobium-based qubits and resonators. While our group has extensively studied this problem at temperatures above 1~K, in this study we quantify for the first time the losses driven by magnetic vortices for niobium-based quantum devices operating down to millikelvin temperature, and in the low photon counts regime. By cooling a single interface system a 3-D niobium superconducting cavity in a dilution refrigerator through the superconducting transition temperature in controlled levels of magnetic fields, we isolate the flux-induced losses and quantify the added surface resistance per unit of trapped magnetic flux. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux introduces approximately 2~n$\Omega /$mG at 10~mK and at 6~GHz in high RRR niobium. We find that the decay rate of a 6~GHz niobium cavity at 10~mK which contains a native niobium pentoxide will be dominated by the TLS oxide losses until vortices begin to impact $T_1$ for trapped magnetic field ($B_{\text{trap}}$) levels of $>$100~mG. In the absence of the niobium pentoxide, $B_{\text{trap}}=$~10~mG limits $Q_0\sim$~10\textsuperscript{10}, or $T_1\sim$~350~ms, highlighting the importance of magnetic shielding and magnetic hygiene in enabling $T_1>$~1~s. We observe that the flux-induced resistance decreases with temperature-yet remains largely field-independent, qualitatively explained by thermal activation of vortices in the flux-flow regime. We present a phenomenological model which captures the salient experimental observations. Scaling our findings to typical transmon qubit dimensions suggests that these 2-D structures could be robust against vortex dissipation up to several hundreds~mG. We are directly addressing vortex losses in transmon qubits made with low RRR Nb films in a separate experimental study.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peyman Fahimi, Andrew J. Irwin, Michael Lynch</p>
            <p>The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather all available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.</p>

While neutronic simulations revealed negligible power profile variations among the materials, finite element analyses highlighted the superior thermal stability of SiC-SiC and the favorable stress resistance of Haynes 230. The high-temperature environment significantly impacted material performance, particularly for Zircaloy-4 and FeCrAl, while SiC-SiC's inherent properties limited its ability to withstand stress loads. Additionally, AI-driven uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the influence of material property variations on maximum hoop stress. The findings underscore the need for further research into high-temperature material properties to facilitate broader applicability of existing materials to advanced reactors. Haynes 230 is identified as the most promising candidate based on the evaluated criteria.</p>

            <h2>Cyclic Voltammetry of Ion-Coupled Electron Transfer Reactions for Diagnosing Energy Storage Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keyvan Malaie</p>
            <p>The methods of Nicholson and Shain and Randles-Sevcik are the paradigms of voltammetry of redox species. However, as they were originally developed for aqueous redox couples, they cannot be directly applied to solid redox films such as those of battery materials. Herein, for the first time, we present a cyclic voltammetry model based on semi-infinite linear diffusion for ion-coupled electron transfer reactions. The simulated CVs contain parameters such as capacity, ion activity, formal potential of proton-coupled electron transfer, and scan rate that are physically more meaningful than those of the current models in characterizing energy storage materials. We apply this model to the MnO2 cathode material as a proof of concept and discuss the significance of the simulation parameters for determining the energetics of the underlying phase transitions and the charge storage mechanisms. According to the present model, two linear regression lines can be established from relatively simple voltammetry experiments for characterizing energy storage materials: 1) The regression line of the CV mid-peak potential vs. Log of ion activity (or pH), in which the slope and the intercept provide information on the type of charge-carrier ions and their solvation state, respectively. 2) The regression line of the capacity vs. the inverse of the square root of scan rate, where the slope and intercept indicate the contributions of bulk and surface charges in thin redox films, respectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valentin Dichtl, Thorsten Schuhmacher, Markus Lippitz</p>
            <p>Babinet's principle is a powerful tool for predicting the scattering behavior of planar structures where the solution for the complementary structure is already known. This makes it ubiquitous in the design of aperture antennas or metamaterials. Even for plasmonic nanostructures, a qualitative match of the behavior for complementary structures has been reported. Here, we discuss whether Babinet's principle can be extended to nonlinear scattering. We compare the third harmonic emission of plasmonic nanorods and complementary nanoslits by far field imaging and simulation. We find significantly different far field images, in agreement between experiment and simulation. We explain these differences by the higher spatial resolution at the third harmonic wavelength and by additional eddy currents in slits that are not present in rods. Within these limits, Babinet's principle can guide the design of inverted nonlinear plasmonic resonators, which promise to be more stable at high excitation power due to better thermal conductivity.</p>

Houck</p>
            <p>Materials improvements are a powerful approach to reducing loss and decoherence in superconducting qubits because such improvements can be readily translated to large scale processors. Recent work improved transmon coherence by utilizing tantalum (Ta) as a base layer and sapphire as a substrate. The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems (TLSs) with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve major improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon (Si) dramatically decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Q) exceeding 1.5 x 10^7, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 x 10^7, corresponding to a lifetime (T_1) of up to 1.68 ms. This low loss allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T_2E) exceeding T_1. We achieve these material improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The Ta-on-Si platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at wafer scale, and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental characterization of various types of spin-exchange interactions between two individual atoms, where pseudo-spin degrees of freedom are encoded in different Rydberg states. For the case of the direct dipole-dipole interaction between states of opposite parity, such as between $nS$ and $nP$, we investigate the effects of positional disorder arising from the residual atomic motion, on the coherence of spin-exchange oscillations. We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the off-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the states $nS$ and $(n+1)S$. Finally, we report on the observation of a new type of dipolar coupling, made resonant using addressable light-shifts and involving four different Rydberg levels: this exchange process is akin to electrically induced Förster resonance, but featuring local control. It exhibits an angular dependence distinct from the usual $1-3\cos^2(\theta)$ form of the resonant dipolar spin-exchange.</p>

            <h2>Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Bols, Wojciech De Roeck, Michiel De Wilde, Bruno de O. Carvalho</p>
            <p>We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Fertig, Mathijs Janssen</p>
            <p>Electric double layer (EDL) formation underlies the functioning of supercapacitors and several other electrochemical technologies. Here, we study how the EDL formation near two flat blocking electrodes separated by $2L$ is affected by beyond-mean-field Coulombic interactions, which can be substantial for electrolytes of high salt concentration or with multivalent ions. Our model combines the Nernst-Planck and Bazant-Storey-Kornyshev (BSK) equations; the latter is a modified Poisson equation with a correlation length $\ell_c$. In response to a voltage step, the system charges exponentially with a characteristic timescale $\tau$ that depends nonmonotonically on $\ell_c$. For small $\ell_c$, $\tau$ is given by the BSK capacitance times a dilute electrolyte's resistance, in line with [Zhao, Phys. Rev. E 84, 051504 (2011)]; here, $\tau$ decreases with increasing $\ell_c$. Increasing the correlation length beyond $\ell_c\approx L^{2/3}\lambda_D^{1/3}$, with $\lambda_D$ the Debye length, $\tau$ reaches a minimum, rises as $\tau\propto \lambda_D\ell_c/D$, and plateaus at $\tau=4L^2/(\pi^2 D)$. Our results imply that strongly correlated, strongly confined electrolytes - ionic liquids in the surface force balance apparatus, say - move slower than predicted so far.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of polarizable particles coupled to a lossy cavity mode that are transversally driven by a laser. Our analysis is performed in the regime where the cavity linewidth exceeds the recoil frequency by several orders of magnitude. Using a two-stage cooling protocol we show that the particles' kinetic energy can be reduced down to the recoil energy. This cooling protocol relies in its first stage on a high laser power such that the particles cool into a strongly self-organized pattern. This can be seen as a strongly magnetized state. In a second stage we adiabatically ramp down the laser intensity such that the particles' kinetic energy is transferred to their potential energy and the particles are ``demagnetized''. In this second stage we optimize the ramping speed which needs to be fast enough to avoid unwanted heating and slow enough such that the dynamics remains to good approximation adiabatic.</p>

            <p>Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N>2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</p>

            <p>Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</p>

            <p>The scalability and power of quantum computing architectures depend critically on high-fidelity operations and robust and flexible qubit connectivity. In this respect, mobile qubits are particularly attractive as they enable dynamic and reconfigurable qubit arrays. This approach allows quantum processors to adapt their connectivity patterns during operation, implement different quantum error correction codes on the same hardware, and optimize resource utilization through dedicated functional zones for specific operations like measurement or entanglement generation. Such flexibility also relieves architectural constraints, as recently demonstrated in atomic systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms manipulated with optical tweezers. In solid-state platforms, highly coherent shuttling of electron spins was recently reported. A key outstanding question is whether it may be possible to perform quantum gates directly on the mobile spins. In this work, we demonstrate two-qubit operations between two electron spins carried towards each other in separate traveling potential minima in a semiconductor device. We find that the interaction strength is highly tunable by their spatial separation, achieving an average two-qubit gate fidelity of about 99\%. Additionally, we implement conditional post-selected quantum state teleportation between spatially separated qubits with an average gate fidelity of 87\%, showcasing the potential of mobile spin qubits for non-local quantum information processing. We expect that operations on mobile qubits will become a universal feature of future large-scale semiconductor quantum processors.</p>

            <p>This work presents a foundational approach for fabricating arrays of self-aligned micro- and nanopillar structures incorporating individual site-controlled quantum dots (QDs) for enhanced light extraction. This method leverages the non-planar surface morphology of pyramidal QD samples to define dielectric masks self - aligned to the QD positions. The mask size, and consequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled through a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any additional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique offers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites, and fully deterministic embedding of QD structures. The functionality of the structures was validated by integrating single In0.25Ga0.75As QDs - upon two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, the emission of single and polarization-entangled photon pairs was observed. Additionally, an extra fabrication step to deposit dome-like structures atop the pillars was demonstrated, effectively enhancing light extraction efficiency up to 12%.</p>

            <p>We present the Python Tree Tensor Network package (pyTTN) for the evaluation of dynamical properties of closed and open quantum systems that makes use of Tree Tensor Network (TTN), or equivalently the multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), based representations of wavefunctions. This package includes several features allowing for easy setup of zero- and finite-temperature calculations for general Hamiltonians using single and multi-set TTN ansätze with an adaptive bond dimension through the use of subspace expansion techniques. All core features are implemented in C++ with Python bindings provided to simplify the use of this package. In addition to these core features, pyTTN provides several tools for setting up efficient simulation of open quantum system dynamics, including the use of the TTN ansatz to represent the auxiliary density operator space for the simulation of the Hierarchical Equation of Motion (HEOM) method and generalised pseudomode methods; furthermore we demonstrate that the two approaches are equivalent up to a non-unitary normal mode transformation acting on the pseudomode degrees of freedom. We present a set of applications of the package, starting with the widely used benchmark case of the photo-excitation dynamics of 24 mode pyrazine, following which we consider a more challenging model describing the exciton dynamics at the interface of a $n$-oligothiophene donor-C$_{60}$ fullerene acceptor system. Finally, we consider applications to open quantum systems, including the spin-boson model, a set of extended dissipative spin models, and an Anderson impurity model. By combining ease of use, an efficient implementation, as well as an extendable design allowing for the addition of future extensions, pyTTN can be integrated in a wide range of computational modelling software.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Richard Barney, Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>We propose a natural quantization of a standard neural network, where the neurons correspond to qubits and the activation functions are implemented via quantum gates and measurements. The simplest quantized neural network corresponds to applying single-qubit rotations, with the rotation angles being dependent on the weights and measurement outcomes of the previous layer. This realization has the advantage of being smoothly tunable from the purely classical limit with no quantum uncertainty (thereby reproducing the classical neural network exactly) to a quantum case, where superpositions introduce an intrinsic uncertainty in the network. We benchmark this architecture on a subset of the standard MNIST dataset and find a regime of "quantum advantage," where the validation error rate in the quantum realization is smaller than that in the classical model. We also consider another approach where quantumness is introduced via weak measurements of ancilla qubits entangled with the neuron qubits. This quantum neural network also allows for smooth tuning of the degree of quantumness by controlling an entanglement angle, $g$, with $g=\frac\pi 2$ replicating the classical regime. We find that validation error is also minimized within the quantum regime in this approach. We also observe a quantum transition, with sharp loss of the quantum network's ability to learn at a critical point $g_c$. The proposed quantum neural networks are readily realizable in present-day quantum computers on commercial datasets.</p>

            <p>Finding good quantum codes for a particular hardware application and determining their error thresholds is central to quantum error correction. The threshold defines the noise level where a quantum code switches between a coding and a no-coding \emph{phase}. Provided sufficiently frequent error correction, the quantum capacity theorem guarantees the existence of an optimal code that provides a maximum communication rate. By viewing a system experiencing repeated error correction as a novel form of matter, this optimal code, in analogy to Jaynes's maximum entropy principle of quantum statistical mechanics, \emph{defines a phase}. We explore coding phases from this perspective using the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), which is a quantum circuit with depolarizing and dephasing channels. Using numerical optimization, we find this model hosts three phases: a maximally mixed phase, a ``$Z_2$ code'' that breaks its U(1) gauge symmetry down to $Z_2$, and a no-coding phase with first-order transitions between them and a novel \emph{zero capacity multi-critical point} where all three phases meet. For the $Z_2$ code, we provide two practical error correction procedures that fall short of the optimal codes and qualitatively alter the phase diagram, splitting the multi-critical point into two second-order coding no-coding phase transitions. Carrying out our approach on current noisy devices could provide a systematic way to construct quantum codes for robust computation and communication.</p>

            <p>Quantum groups and quantum algebras have received considerable attention in the last decades because they are very useful as mathematical tools of research. Existing proposals for quantum groups have always suggested the idea of deforming a classical object. Motivated by the possibility of anyons in three dimensions ($d=3$), with important consequences to a wide range of fields of physics, in the present work we investigate how the magnetization and other thermodynamic quantities, associated to the Landau diamagnetism problem, depend on the deforming parameter of two models with intermediate statistics: (i) $q$-fermions and (ii) $F$-anyons, and make {\it comparisons between both cases}. In particular, we extend the results from the literature for $q$-fermions by considering {\it second order terms} in the expansion of the grand partition function. Also, we find that for $F$-anyons statistics the magnetization shows a stronger response with respect to magnetic fields compared to magnetization for $q$-fermions statistics. This theoretical outcome may be experimentally verified for instance in superconductors, that are perfect diamagnetic materials with strong magnetic susceptibility, by adjusting impurities or pressure. The latter can be associated to the deforming parameter $q$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jie Chen, Chun Chen, Xiaoqun Wang</p>
            <p>Using numerical quantum quenches with the integration of both symmetry and energy resolutions, we comprehensively study the dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement in a disordered Bose-Hubbard (dBH) model, concentrating on the two types of inhomogeneous initial states to target the lower- and higher-energy sections of its dynamical phase diagram. (i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel "entropy imbalance pattern" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities.</p>

            <p>Ta-Cu and NbSe2-Cu heterocontacts have been studied. For Ta-Cu contacts, a theoretical estimation of the delta-functional barrier at the boundary, arising due to the mismatch of the Fermi parameters of the contacting metals, has been carried out, and good agreement between the calculation and experiment has been obtained. An expression for estimating the diameter of the heterocontact on both sides of the boundary is obtained. The value of the jump-like reduction of the excess current (and superconducting gap) associated with the phase transition of the superconducting region near the point contact to a spatially inhomogeneous state when the critical concentration of nonequilibrium quasiparticles is reached is determined. The dependence of the additive differential resistance on the displacement at the contact arising after the phase transition due to the excess charge of quasiparticles and the associated reverse current (or additive voltage) is obtained. In 2H-NbSe2, a two-zone superconductivity character with an 8-fold difference in the energy gap values takes place. Under the action of current injection of nonequilibrium quasiparticles, there is a sequential phase transition of layers adjacent to the point contact into a spatially inhomogeneous state with a suppressed gap, which is accompanied by a stepwise change in the slope of the I-V curve with a discrete increase in the differential resistance.</p>

            <p>Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model is paradigmatic to study quantum phase transition in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems and entanglement dynamics in a variety of disciplines. The generic LMG model usually incorporates two nonlinear interactions. While the classical dynamics of the single-nonlinear-inteaction LMG model is well understood through Jacobi elliptic functions, the dualinteraction case remains unexplored due to analytical challenges. Here, by constructing an auxiliary function that maps the dynamics to the complex plane of Jacobi elliptic functions, we derive exact solutions of classical dynamics for the dual-interaction LMG model. Based on the exact solutions, we give the classical dynamical phase diagram of the LMG model with dual nonlinear interactions, and find out a non-logarithmic behavior of dynamical criticality which is absent in case of single nonlinear interaction. Our results establish a benchmark to analyze the quantum dynamical phase transitions and many-body entanglement dynamics of finite-size LMG model.</p>

We explain this chiral adiabatic transmission (CAT) as a consequence of the adiabatic evolution of the scattering modes both in momentum and real space. The dispersion relation of the junction then separates the scattering trajectories by introducing inaccessible regions of phase space. We expect that CAT is observable in nonlocal conductance and thermal transport measurements. Furthermore, because it does not rely on particle-hole symmetry, CAT is also possible to observe directly in metamaterials.</p>

We present results for several examples, namely the bosonic Laughlin state stabilized by contact two-body interactions and the bosonic Moore-Read state stabilized by either three- or two-body interactions. Our findings demonstrate that the Bisognano-Wichmann Hamiltonian provides a reliable approximation of the entanglement Hamiltonian as a fully-local operator that can be written without any prior knowledge of the specific state under consideration.</p>

            <h2>The Uhlmann Phase Winding in Bose-Einstein Condensates at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-Yan Wang, Yan He</p>
            <p>We investigate the Uhlmann phase, a generalization of the celebrated Berry phase, for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at finite temperature. The Uhlmann phase characterizes topological properties of mixed states, in contrast to the Berry phase which is defined for pure states at zero temperature. Using the $SU(1,1)$ symmetry of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, we derive a general formula for the Uhlmann phase of BECs. Numerical calculations reveal that the Uhlmann phase can differ from the Berry phase in the zero-temperature limit, contrary to previous studies. As the temperature increases, the Uhlmann phase exhibits a winding behavior, and we relate the total winding degree to the Berry phase. This winding indicates that the Uhlmann phase takes values on a Riemann surface. Furthermore, we propose an experimental scheme to measure the Uhlmann phase of BECs by purifying the density matrix using an atomic interferometer.</p>

            <p>Owing to their great expressivity and versatility, neural networks have gained attention for simulating large two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, their expressivity comes with the cost of a challenging optimization due to the in general rugged and complicated loss landscape. Here, we present a hybrid optimization scheme for neural quantum states (NQS), involving a data-driven pretraining with numerical or experimental data and a second, Hamiltonian-driven optimization stage. By using both projective measurements from the computational basis as well as expectation values from other measurement configurations such as spin-spin correlations, our pretraining gives access to the sign structure of the state, yielding improved and faster convergence that is robust w.r.t. experimental imperfections and limited datasets. We apply the hybrid scheme to the ground state search for the 2D transverse field Ising model and dipolar XY model on $6\times 6$ and $10\times 10$ square lattices with a patched transformer wave function, using numerical data as well as experimental data from a programmable Rydberg quantum simulator [Chen et al., Nature 616 (2023)], and show that the information from a second measurement basis highly improves the performance. Our work paves the way for a reliable and efficient optimization of neural quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We compute the wavefunctions of the Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result differs from that in graphene and Weyl semimetals, where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. The multifold nature of the triple-point fermions is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction.</p>

            <p>Leveraging advanced semiconductor manufacturing promises potential for scaling up silicon-based quantum processors. In this context, control and readout of individual spin qubits have been shown on devices manufactured on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customized for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the spin-spin exchange interaction, which forms the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We observe gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns and a gate quality factor of $10$. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubits unit cell while providing high gain. We achieve a $74\%$ singlet-triplet readout fidelity in $8~\mu$s integration time, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration on a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards the large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.</p>

            <p>We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of the quantum analog of entanglement between two electric circuits equivalent to two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.</p>

            <h2>Interplay between evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Kruti, Roman-Pascal Riwar</p>
            <p>Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behaviour remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterising the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependant scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalising Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependant scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependant probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal-metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behaviour of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.</p>

The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses. An oscillating magnetic field at frequencies from tens of MHz to GHz and up to 4 mT magnitude excited dynamic modes in the domain walls along with the vortex core gyration.

Our study uncovers the origin of magnetic multipolar interactions in these systems and demonstrates that a combination of quadrupolar and octupolar magnetic order can simultaneously induce both electrical quadrupolar moments and ferroelectric polarization. By expanding the multiferroic framework to higher-order multipoles, we reveal the possibility of coexisting multipolar orders of different or same ranks, paving the way for new functional properties in a large class of strongly correlated materials.</p>

            <p>We explore the ground states and quench dynamics of one-dimensional quantum droplets with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and an imbalance in intracomponent interactions. A plethora of miscible ground state stripe and standard (i.e., non-modulated) droplets is found depending on the SOC wavenumber and building upon Gaussian to flat-top background for increasing (decreasing) atom number (interactions). Deformations among the states were accompanied by spin population transfer caused by the Rabi coupling and could be controlled by adjusting the interactions or the SOC parameters. When considering a trap, we identified a transition from a bound to a trapped gas many-body state, characterized by a sign change of the chemical potential, which occurred at lower (larger) atom numbers for tighter traps (stronger interactions). The droplet's breathing motion was accompanied by minor population transfer, and its frequency increases for a larger intracomponent interaction ratio or reaching a maximum at SOC wavenumbers, where the transition from non-modulated flat-top to stripe droplets occurred. We witness droplet fragmentation for abrupt changes in the Rabi coupling while large amplitude quenches of the SOC wavenumber trigger spin-demixing, resulting in constant amplitude but opposite direction motion of untrapped droplets or in-trap out-of-phase oscillating droplets. Our findings have implications for controlled spin-demixing processes of droplets and the excitation of relevant magnetic bound states.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) 1T-VSe$_2$ has prompted significant interest due to the discrepancies regarding alleged ferromagnetism (FM) at room temperature, charge density wave (CDW) states and the interplay between the two. We employed a combined Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and density functional theory (DFT) approach to accurately investigate the magnetic properties, CDW states, and their response to strain in monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$. Our calculations show the delicate competition between various phases, revealing critical insights into the relationship between their energetic and structural properties. We performed classical Monte Carlo simulations informed by our DMC and DFT results, and found the magnetic transition temperature ($T_c$) of the undistorted (non-CDW) FM phase to be 228 K and the distorted (CDW) phase to be 68 K. Additionally, we studied the response of biaxial strain on the energetic stability and magnetic properties of various phases of 2D 1T-VSe$_2$ and found that small amounts of strain can increase the $T_c$, suggesting a promising route for engineering and enhancing magnetic behavior. Finally, we synthesized 1T-VSe$_2$ and performed Raman spectroscopy measurements, which were in close agreement with our calculated results, validating our computational approach. Our work emphasizes the role of highly accurate DMC methods in advancing the understanding of monolayer 1T-VSe$_2$ and provides a robust framework for future studies of 2D magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Nonperturbative calculation of exchange coupling parameters</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda</p>
            <p>Exchange coupling parameters $J_{ij}$ within the Heisenberg model and its extensions are crucial for understanding magnetic behavior at the atomic level. To calculate $J_{ij}$ from first principles, perturbative methods based on the magnetic force theorem (MFT), commonly referred to as Liechtenstein's method, have been widely employed. However, the quantitative accuracy of $J_{ij}$ obtained through this perturbative technique remains uncertain. In this paper, we nonperturbatively calculate $J_{ij}$ for several systems of both fundamental and applied significance, including perovskite SrMnO$_3$, neodymium-magnet compounds, and elemental 3$d$ transition metals, and compare these results with those obtained using the conventional MFT-based method. The nonperturbative approach provides consistent results for magnetic configurations exhibiting a certain degree of magnetic disorder. In contrast, due to its inherent theoretical limitations, the MFT-based method struggles to accurately evaluate the magnetic energy in such configurations. As discussed later in this paper, these discrepancies arise from neglected contributions within MFT-based methods. Our nonperturbative scheme is highly versatile and holds strong prospects as a new platform for analyzing and designing spintronic materials, where developing accurate spin models is essential.</p>

            <h2>Lattice thermal conductivity in the anharmonic overdamped regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Đorđe Dangić, Giovanni Caldarelli, Raffaello Bianco, Ivana Savić, Ion Errea</p>
            <p>In crystalline materials, low lattice thermal conductivity is often associated with strong anharmonicity, which can cause significant deviations from the expected Lorentzian lineshape of phonon spectral functions. These deviations, occurring in an overdamped regime, raise questions about the applicability of the Boltzmann transport equation. Furthermore, strong anharmonicity can trigger structural phase transitions with temperature, which cannot be adequately described by the standard harmonic approximation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for computing the lattice thermal conductivity. Our method combines the Green-Kubo linear response theory with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The latter allows us to describe the temperature-dependent evolution of the crystal structure, including first- and second-order phase transitions, as well as the vibrational properties in highly anharmonic materials. The Green-Kubo method considers the entire lineshapes of phonon spectral functions in the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity, thus eliminating the questionable use of phonon lifetimes in the overdamped regime, as well as naturally including coherent transport effects. Additionally, we extend our theory to model complex dynamical lattice thermal conductivity, enhancing our understanding of time-dependent thermoreflectance experiments. As a practical application, we employ this approach to calculate the lattice thermal conductivity of CsPbBr$_3$, a complex crystal known for its anomalous thermal transport behavior with a complex phase diagram. Our method is able to determine the thermal conductivity across different phases in good agreement with experiments.</p>

We show theoretically that the alternating $g$-tensor anisotropy in altermagnets can induce weak ferromagnetism even when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is forbidden. We demonstrate this mechanism to explain weak ferromagnetism for both collinear and noncollinear spin altermagnets. Our findings provide new insights into the origin of weak ferromagnetism and suggest orbital-based ways for manipulating magnetic configurations in altermagnets.</p>

Mathematically, it represents a lower bound in the variance of unknown parameters that are related to the distributions one has access, and a metric for probability manifolds. A stochastic analogous of the Fisher Information, dubbed stochastic Fisher Information was recently introduced in the literature by some of us. By exploring the probability distributions of the Stochastic Fisher Information (SFI), we uncover two fluctuation relations with an inherent geometric nature, as the SFI acts as a single nonequilibrium trajectory metric. The geometric nature of these relations is expressed through a stochastic length in entropy space derived from the system entropy associated with a nonequilibrium trajectory. We also explore the possibility of trajectory-dependent uncertainty relations linked to the SFI with time as a parameter. Finally, we test our geometric fluctuation relations using two nonequilibrium models.</p>

Our 30-nm thick ferroelectric Al0.68Sc0.32N film grown on SiC exhibits stable and robust ferroelectric switching up to 1000°C. The coercive field decreases linearly from -6.4/+11.9 MV cm-1 at room temperature to -3.1/+7.8 MV cm-1 at 800°C, further reducing to -2.5 MV cm-1 at 1000°C. At 600°C, the devices achieve remarkable reliability with ~2000 endurance cycles and over at least 100 hours of retention with negligible polarization loss. At 800°C, the devices retain data for at least 10,000 seconds and exceed 400 write cycles.

            <p>Neural network potentials (NNPs) enable large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of systems containing >10,000 atoms with the accuracy comparable to ab initio methods and play a crucial role in material studies. Although NNPs are valuable for short-duration MD simulations, maintaining the stability of long-duration MD simulations remains challenging due to the uncharted regions of the potential energy surface (PES). Currently, there is no effective methodology to address this issue. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automatic generator of robust and accurate NNPs based on an active learning (AL) framework. This generator provides a fully integrated solution encompassing initial dataset creation, NNP training, evaluation, sampling of additional structures, screening, and labeling. Crucially, our approach uses a sampling strategy that focuses on generating unstable structures with short interatomic distances, combined with a screening strategy that efficiently samples these configurations based on interatomic distances and structural features. This approach greatly enhances the MD simulation stability, enabling nanosecond-scale simulations. We evaluated the performance of our NNP generator in terms of its MD simulation stability and physical properties by applying it to liquid propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The generated NNPs enable stable MD simulations of systems with >10,000 atoms for 20 ns. The predicted physical properties, such as the density and self-diffusion coefficient, show excellent agreement with the experimental values. This work represents a remarkable advance in the generation of robust and accurate NNPs for organic materials, paving the way for long-duration MD simulations of complex systems.</p>

            <p>Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu (BW) model under linear quenches. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density after exiting the impulse regime does not follow from a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening dynamics; the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form with an exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we show that, if the system starts from its ground state, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with an exponential decay of the excess defect density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the defect density exhibits a good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism.</p>

            <p>Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.</p>

            <h2>A Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Ashvin Vishwanath, Daniel E. Parker</p>
            <p>The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</p>

            <p>Molecular electronics and other technologies whose components comprise individual molecules have been pursued for half a century because the molecular scale represents the limit of miniaturisation of objects whose structure is tuneable for function. Despite the promise, practical progress has been hindered by the lack of methodologies for directed assembly of arbitrary structures applicable at the molecular scale. DNA nanotechnology is an emerging framework that uses programmed synthetic oligomers to encode the design of self-assembling structures with atomic precision at the nanoscale. Here, we leverage DNA-directed self-assembly to construct single-molecule electrical transport devices in high yield, precisely positioning a metal-porphyrin between two 60 nm gold nanoparticles. Following deposition on SiO2 substrates, we image and establish electrical contact via established nanofabrication techniques. Each step of the process has a high probability of success and we demonstrate device yields dramatically better than is possible using conventional approaches. Our approach is inherently scalable and adaptable to devices incorporating multiple heterogenous functional molecular components, finally offering a realistic framework for the realisation of classical and quantum molecular technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantized Magneto-Terahertz Effects in the Antiferromagnetic Topological Insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ Thin Films</h2>

            <p>MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an ideal platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and topology. Many exotic topological phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator, have been observed in few-layer MBT. A key feature in MBT is the emergence of the surface exchange gap, which lies in the milli-electron-volt range (1 THz corresponds to 4.14 meV). This makes THz spectroscopy a powerful tool to probe the associated topological physics. In this study, we report the THz spectra of Faraday and Kerr rotations in MBT thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By varying the external magnetic field, we observe three magnetic states: the antiferromagnetic state, the canted antiferromagnetic state, and the ferromagnetic state. Our terahertz results show a quantized Hall state under 6 T in both 6 SL and 7 SL samples without gate voltage. These findings provide new insights into the magneto-terahertz properties of MBT and its potential for topological spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate quantum transport in a two-dimensional electron system coupled to a chiral molecular potential, demonstrating how molecular chirality and orientation affect charge and spin transport properties. We propose a minimal model for realizing true chiral symmetry breaking on a magnetized surface, with a crucial role played by the tilt angle of the molecular dipole with respect to the surface. For non-zero tilting, we show that the Hall response exhibits clear signatures of chirality-induced effects, both in charge and spin-resolved observables. Concerning the former, tilted enantiomers produce asymmetric Hall conductances and, even more remarkably, the persistence of this feature in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) signals how the enantiospecific charge response results from electron scattering off the molecular potential. Concerning spin-resolved observables where SOC plays a relevant role, we reveal that chiral symmetry breaking is crucial in enabling spin-flipping processes.</p>

            <p>Despite its widespread use in materials science, conventional molecular dynamics simulations are severely constrained by timescale limitations. To address this shortcoming, we propose an empirical formulation of accelerated molecular dynamics method, adapted from a collective-variable-based extended system dynamics framework. While this framework is originally developed for efficient free energy sampling and reaction pathway determination of specific rare events in condensed matter, we have modified it to enable accelerated molecular dynamics simulation and prediction of microstructure evolution of materials across a broad range of scenarios. In essence, the nearest neighbor off-centering absolute displacement (NNOAD), which quantifies the deviation of an atom from the geometric center of its nearest neighbors in materials, is introduced. We propose that the collection of NNOADs of all atoms can serve as a generalized reaction coordinate for various structural transitions in materials. The NNOAD of each atom, represented by its three components, is coupled with three additional dynamic variables assigned to the atom. Time evolution of the additional dynamic variables follows Langevin equation, while Nosé-Hoover dynamics is employed to thermostat the system. Through careful analysis and benchmark simulations, we established appropriate parameter ranges for the equations in our method. Application of this method to several test cases demonstrates its effectiveness and consistency in accelerating molecular dynamics simulations and predicting various microstructure evolutions of materials over much longer timescale. We also provide a preliminary theoretical analysis and qualitative justification of the method, offering insights into its underlying principles.</p>

            <p>When can we map a classical density profile to an external potential? In equilibrium, without time dependence, the one-body density is known to specify the external potential that is applied to the many-body system. This mapping from a density to the potential is the cornerstone of classical density functional theory (DFT). Here, we consider non-equilibrium, time-dependent many-body systems that evolve from a given initial condition. We derive explicit conditions, for example, no flux at the boundary, that ensure that the mapping from the density to a time-dependent external potential is unique. We thus prove the underlying assertion of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT), without resorting to the so-called adiabatic approximation often used in applications. By ascertaining uniqueness for all $n$-body densities, we ensure that the proof and the physical conclusions drawn from it hold for general superadiabatic dynamics of interacting systems even in the presence of (known) non-conservative forces.</p>

            <p>Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22~mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaozhou Feng, Matteo Ippoliti</p>
            <p>The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure. Recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name ensemble pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small (and tunable) amount of entanglement. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment, or number of copies. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp distinguishability transitions.</p>

            <p>Empirical contact networks or interaction networks demonstrate peculiar characteristics stemming from the fundamental social, psychological, physical mechanisms governing human interactions. Although these mechanisms are complex, we test whether we are able to reproduce some dynamical properties of these empirical networks from relatively simple models. In this study, we perform simulations for a range of 2D models of particle dynamics, namely the Random Walk, Active Brownian Particles, and Vicsek models, to generate artificial contact networks. We investigate temporal properties of these contact networks: the distributions of contact durations, inter-contact durations and number of contact per pair of particle. We demonstrate that the distribution of inter-contact durations can be recovered by the dynamics of these simple crowd particle models, and show that it is simply related to the well-know first-return process, which explains the -3/2 exponent that is found in both the numerical models and empirical contact networks.</p>

            <p>The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials.

We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p>The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</p>

            <p>The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N < 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</p>

Such a dynamics is intrinsically non-linear, stochastic, and correlated, hence bearing deep similarities with turbulence in fluid mechanics or plasma physics.

In particular, limiting ourselves to the leading order truncation in this closure scheme, the so-called "Direct Interaction Approximation", and placing ourselves in the limit of an isotropic distribution of orientations, we explicitly compare the associated prediction for the two-point correlation function with measures from numerical simulations. We discuss the successes and limitations of this approach and present possible future venues.</p>

            <p>Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.</p>

            <p>Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as those encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes was experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and it does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and we find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wave function changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.</p>

In this work, we introduce MOFFlow, the first deep generative model tailored for MOF structure prediction.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Riemannian flow matching framework that reduces the dimensionality of the problem by treating the metal nodes and organic linkers as rigid bodies, capitalizing on the inherent modularity of MOFs. By operating in the $SE(3)$ space, MOFFlow effectively captures the roto-translational dynamics of these rigid components in a scalable way. Our experiment demonstrates that MOFFlow accurately predicts MOF structures containing several hundred atoms, significantly outperforming conventional methods and state-of-the-art machine learning baselines while being much faster.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Wang, Wei-Hai Fang, Zhendong Li</p>
            <p>Many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) based on Green's functions and Feynman diagrams provides a fundamental theoretical framework for various \emph{ab initio} computational approaches in molecular and materials science, including the random phase approximation (RPA) and $GW$ approximation. Unfortunately, this perturbation expansion often fails in systems with strong multi-reference characters. Extending diagrammatic MBPT to the multi-reference case is highly nontrivial and remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the breakdown of Wick's theorem. In this work, we develop a diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of MBPT for computing correlation energies of strongly correlated systems, by using the cumulant expansion of many-body Green's function in place of Wick's theorem. This theoretical framework bridges the gap between MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theories (MRPT) in quantum chemistry, which had been almost exclusively formulated within time-independent wavefunction frameworks prior to this work. Our formulation enables the explicit incorporation of strong correlation effects from the outset as in MRPT, while treating residual weak interactions through a generalized diagrammatic perturbation expansion as in MBPT. As a concrete demonstration, we formulate a multi-reference (MR) extension of the standard single-reference (SR) RPA by systematically resumming generalized ring diagrams, which naturally leads to a unified set of equations applicable to both SR and MR cases. Benchmark calculations on prototypical molecular systems reveal that MR-RPA successfully resolves the well-known failure of SR-RPA in strongly correlated systems. This theoretical advancement paves the way for advancing \emph{ab initio} computational methods through diagrammatic resummation techniques in future.</p>

Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p>

            <p>When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials.

For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.</p>

We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian.

Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting (SC) circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We then propose a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, and show the application of this approach to fusing and braiding the $d=3$ parafermions. We also examine the experimental parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in SC devices. This work extends previous quantum simulation for twist defects in SC qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</p>

            <h2>Exciton-polaritons and exciton localization from a first-principles interacting Green's function formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary N. Mauri, Christopher J. Ciccarino, Jonah B. Haber, Diana Y. Qiu, Felipe H. da Jornada</p>
            <p>Exciton-polaritons -- hybrid states of photons and excitons -- offer unique avenues for controlling electronic, optical, and chemical properties of materials. However, their modeling is mostly limited to formalisms that wash out atomistic details and many-body physics critical to describing real systems. Here, we present an ab initio Green's function formalism based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) wherein exciton-polaritons naturally emerge through an attractive, dynamical electron-hole exchange interaction. In MgO and crystalline pentacene, this attractive interaction dramatically reduces exciton Bohr radii and increases, by one order of magnitude, transition dipole moments of exciton-polaritons. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental polariton dispersions in wurtzite CdS, and allow one to capture how electronic and collective excitations in materials are qualitatively modified through polaritonic effects.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Strain-Induced Pseudogauge Fields on Exciton Dispersion, Transport, and Interactions in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiva Heidari, Shervin Parsi, Pouyan Ghaemi</p>
            <p>We study the effects of strain on exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, we derive the exciton dispersion relation in strained TMDs and demonstrate that strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields significantly influence exciton transport and interactions. Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering as a powerful tool for controlling exciton transport and interactions in TMD-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Cooperativity on the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of the Light-induced Spin-State Switching of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ Spin-Crossover Complex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chetana Badala Viswanatha, Johannes Stöckl, Benito Arnoldi, Johannes Knippertz, Florian Haag, Hauke Paulsen, Juliusz A. Wolny, Martin Aeschlimann, Volker Schünemann, Benjamin Stadtmüller</p>
            <p>Spin crossover (SCO) complexes are highly flexible bistable molecular switches with two distinct spin states that can be switched into each other by external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, or light. In the condensed phase, this spin switching phenomenon is determined not only by the chemical and structural properties of the SCO compound but also by intermolecular interactions within the SCO material and their coupling to surfaces. These interactions lead to cooperative effects in the spin switching behavior that are, for instance, reflected in the thermal hysteresis of the spin switching or determine the speed of the thermal and optical spin transition within a thin film of SCO complexes. In this study, we shed new light on the cooperativity-driven spatial and temporal dynamics of the collective light-induced spin switching of thin SCO films on a gold single crystal. We quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of the transition between the low-spin and high-spin light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST) states of the Fe(phen)$_2$(SCN)$_2$ compound. Using real-time photoemission electron microscopy with millisecond time resolution, we uncover spectroscopic signatures of the light-induced spin state switching to the LIESST state even $200\, \mu$m outside the spot of direct optical excitation. This observation is identical for both continuous wave and femtosecond laser light excitations in the visible spectral range. The timescale of the spin-switching dynamics is indicative of a photothermal process in which molecules far from the laser spot relax back to the low-spin ground state faster than those within the directly illuminated region. All of these observations highlight the crucial role of cooperative interactions in the spin state switching of the SCO thin film.</p>

            <h2>Nonresonant Casimir-Polder repulsion with a monolayer topological insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bing-Sui Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate the behavior of the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force acting on a metastable right-circularly polarized state of a two-level atomic system in the presence of a monolayer topological insulator inhabiting an anomalous quantum Hall insulator state with a negative Chern number, finding that the force can be repulsive for a certain range within the far-field region. By considering stanene irradiated by circularly polarized monochromatic laser light as a material example of a monolayer topological insulator, we study the effect of the frequency dispersion in the conductivity tensor on the force behavior, finding that the dispersion generally leads to a slight downward shift of the force relative to that predicted by a nondispersive approximation, as well as a slight reduction of the range over which the force is repulsive.</p>

            <p>We show that Raman circular dichroism (RCD) is a powerful probe of chiral quantum spin liquids (QSL) governed by the topology of fractionalized spin excitations. Starting from the Loudon-Fleury formalism of Mott insulators, we compute the RCD and demonstrate that it is identical to the result obtained from a direct light-matter coupling to effective spinon bands. The RCD signal originates from contributions of Berry curvature and quantum metric. To illustrate this, we apply our approach to two examples - the Kitaev honeycomb model in a magnetic field and a chiral $U(1)$ QSL on the triangular lattice - and discuss its experimental relevance for candidate materials.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing Defect Complex Structures of PL6 in SiC: Insights from First-Principles Screening</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Zhao, Mingzhe Liu, Chang-Kui Duan</p>
            <p>The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC has attracted significant research attention owing to its remarkable spin and optical properties at ambient temperatures. Unlike many color centers that require cryogenic conditions to function, the PL6 center maintains optical activity even at room temperature or higher, benefiting from the material's high thermal conductivity and chemical stability. To elucidate the origin of PL6's distinctive characteristics and clarify its microscopic structure in the crystal, this study conducts a comprehensive investigation of potential defect complexes through systematic first-principles calculations. Our computational approach rigorously evaluates the electronic structures and spin-related properties of various defect configurations, enabling reasonable identification of the most probable atomic arrangement responsible for the observed characteristics of PL6. Our analysis identifies a limited set of candidate structures with ${\rm C_{3v}}$-like symmetry consistent with known experimental signatures. Among these, two defect complexes emerge as the most likely PL6 candidates. The findings suggest that targeted experimental studies, such as electron spin resonance and optically detected magnetic resonance, could further clarify the nature of the PL6 center, while additional theoretical investigations on transition matrix elements and defect formation dynamics are warranted.</p>

            <h2>Extrinsic Geometry and Gappable Edges in Rotationally Invariant Topological Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sounak Sinha, Barry Bradlyn</p>
            <p>Recent work on Abelian topological phases with rotational symmetry has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. First, we analyze an effective hydrodynamic theory for an Abelian topological phase with vanishing Hall conductance. After integrating out the bulk hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, we identify charge neutral, rotationally invariant mass terms by coupling the propagating boundary modes to the extrinsic geometry. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action that depends on the extrinsic geometry of the boundary, regardless of the shift. Finally, we apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetry and open a gap in the edge spectrum.</p>

            <p>Heat transport can be modelled with a variety of approaches in real space (using molecular dynamics) or in reciprocal space (using the Boltzmann transport equation). Employing two conceptually different approaches of each type, we study heat transport in crystalline polyethylene and polythiophene. We find that consistent results can be obtained when using highly efficient and accurate machine-learned potentials, provided that the physical intricacies of the considered materials and methods are correctly accounted for. For polythiophene this turns out to be comparably straightforward, while for polyethylene we find that the inclusion of higher-order anharmonicities is crucial to avoid a massive overestimation of the thermal conductivity. The responsible long-lived phonons are found at relatively high frequencies between 11 THz and 16 THz. This complicates the use of classical statistics in all molecular-dynamics-based approaches.</p>

            <p>We systematically explore a pathway for generating nonlinear charge and spin photocurrents using spin-orbit-split surface states. This mechanism enables net charge and spin flow along the surface plane even in centrosymmetric bulk environments like the Rashba prototype Au(111), where we establish the key principles by combining model predictions with density functional calculations. We further identify the Tl/Si(111) surface, characterized by strong non-Rashba spin-orbit coupling, as a prime candidate for experimental validation; with slight doping, it develops metallic spin-orbit-split states featuring remarkable relativistic properties while the bulk remains semiconducting. Our non-linear simulations reveal distinct angular signatures and magnitudes comparable to bulk ferroelectrics, highlighting the potential of surface-state photocurrents for low-bias optoelectronic applications. Moreover, the intricate spin polarization of surface states opens new possibilities as a nonlinear spin filter, providing a far more versatile platform than the spin Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Non-reciprocal interactions in elastic media give rise to rich non-equilibrium behaviors, but controllable experimental realizations of such odd elastic phenomena remain scarce. Building on recent breakthroughs in electrical analogs of non-Hermitian solid-state systems, we design and analyze scalable odd electrical circuits (OECs) as exact analogs of an odd solid. We show that electrical work can be extracted from OECs via cyclic excitations and trace the apparent energy gain back to active circuit elements. We show that OECs host oscillatory modes that resemble recent experimental observations in living chiral crystals and identify active resonances that reveal a perspective on odd elasticity as a mechanism for mechanical amplification.</p>

            <p>We study the frustration pattern of a square lattice with in-situ fabricated Nb-Pt-Nb four-terminal Josephson junctions. The four-terminal geometry gives rise to a checker board pattern of alternating fluxes f, f' piercing the plaquettes, which stabilizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition even at irrational flux quanta per unit cell, due to an unequal repartition of integer flux sum f+f' into alternating plaquettes. This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junctions array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junctions central weak link area.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida</p>
            <p>Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary Rényi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Reshaping the Quantum Arrow of Time</h2>

            <p>The microscopic laws of physics are symmetric under time reversal. Yet, most natural processes that we observe are not. The emergent asymmetry between typical and time-reversed processes is referred to as the arrow of time. In quantum physics, an arrow of time emerges when a sequence of measurements is performed on a system. We introduce quantum control tools that can yield dynamics more consistent with time flowing backward than forward. The control tools are based on the explicit construction of a Hamiltonian that can replicate the stochastic trajectories of a monitored quantum system. Such Hamiltonian can reverse the effect of monitoring and, via a feedback process, generate trajectories consistent with a reversed arrow of time. We show how to exploit the feedback process to design a continuous measurement engine that draws energy from the monitoring process, or to simulate the backward-in-time dynamics of an open quantum system.</p>

            <h2>Eph-ephrin-mediated differential persistence as a mechanism for cell sorting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marius Bothe, Eloise Lardet, Alexei Poliakov, Gunnar Pruessner, Thibault Bertrand, Ignacio Bordeu</p>
            <p>The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially into clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue morphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between mechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various spatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to symmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental data from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting mechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells. This mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related receptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the symmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient differential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore, we show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes in direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion forces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of sorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the relevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into developmental processes and tissue patterning.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic Dicke model reveals the important role that counter-rotating wave terms play in the coupling between light and two level atoms. It is intriguing to generate the model to the strongly correlated many body case, where the competition between atomic interaction and light-atom coupling will induce exotic phenomenon. In this paper, we provide a periodically driving method for engineering an anisotropic Dicke model with strong dipole-dipole interaction between atoms based on Rydberg atom arrays in cavity. By modulating the pumping laser, the ratio of counter-rotating wave terms to rotating ones could be tuned from zero to infinity. As an illustrative example, the superiority of this tunability in the adiabatic state preparation is revealed. Our engineered model provides an extensive foundation for subsequet research of quantum simulation, many-body physics and even information processing.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yizhou Xu, Antoine Maillard, Lenka Zdeborová, Florent Krzakala</p>
            <p>In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</p>

Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</p>

            <p>Chiral superconductivity exhibits the formation of novel electron pairs that breaks the time-reversal symmetry and has been actively studied in various quantum materials in recent years. However, despite its potential to provide definitive information, effects of disorder in the crystal structure on the chiral superconductivity has not yet been clarified, and therefore the investigation using a solid-solution system is desirable. We report muon-spin-relaxation (muSR) results of layered pnictide BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with a honeycomb network composed of Pt and (As, Sb). We observed an increase of the zero-field muon-spin relaxation rate in the superconducting (SC) state at the Sb end of x=1.0, suggesting the occurrence of spontaneous magnetic field due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the SC state. On the other hand, spontaneous magnetic field was almost and completely suppressed for the As-Sb mixed samples of x=0.9 and 0.2, respectively, suggesting that the time-reversal symmetry breaking SC state in x=1.0 is sensitive to disorder. The magnetic penetration depth estimated from transverse-field muSR measurements at x=1.0 and 0.2 behaved like weak-coupling s-wave superconductivity. These seemingly incompatible zero-field and transverse-field muSR results of BaPtAs_1-x_Sb_x_ with x=1.0 could be understood in terms of chiral d-wave superconductivity with point nodes on the three-dimensional Fermi surface.</p>

            <p>We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.</p>

            <p>A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of the valence electron density accompanied by a distortion of the lattice structure. The microscopic details of CDW formation are closely tied to the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, which describes the behavior of electronic collective modes. Despite decades of extensive study, the behavior of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the vicinity of a CDW transition has never been measured with high energy resolution ($\sim$meV). Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe$_3$ using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons in these materials, which undergo conventional softening due to the Kohn anomaly at the CDW wavevector, the electronic excitations display purely relaxational dynamics that are well described by a diffusive model. The diffusivity peaks around 250 K, just below the critical temperature. Additionally, we report, for the first time, a divergence in the real part of $\chi(q,\omega)$ in the static limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), a phenomenon predicted to characterize CDWs since the 1970s. These results highlight the importance of energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of electronic susceptibility and demonstrate the power of M-EELS as a versatile probe of charge dynamics in materials.</p>

            <h2>Designing Flat Bands and Pseudo-Landau Levels in GaAs with Patterned Gates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre A. Pantaleon, Zhen Zhan, Siddhartha E. Morales, Gerardo G. Naumis</p>
            <p>We investigate the electronic properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a periodic patterned gate. By incorporating the superlattice (SL) potential induced by patterning into the Schrodinger equation, we develop a methodology for obtaining exact analytical solutions. These solutions enable us to construct a comprehensive phase diagram illustrating the emergence of narrow bands and pseudo-Landau levels driven by the SL potential. To complement the analytical approach, we employ a standard plane-wave formalism to track the evolution of the band structure as the SL strength increases. By breaking the inversion symmetry of the SL potential, we found a nontrivial band topology. Furthermore, we introduce a self-consistent Hartree screening to account for the interplay between the SL potential and electronic interactions. Our findings not only reveal the emergence of a non-trivial band topology and a competition between SL strength and electron-electron interactions, but also highlight the value of exact analytical solutions for understanding and engineering electronic phases in patterned 2DEG systems.</p>

            <h2>Topological phase transition in monolayer 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Mortezaei Nobahari, Mahmood Rezaei Roknabadi</p>
            <p>1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. We theoretically prove the topological behavior and phase transition of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ using $k.p$ Hamiltonian and linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a strong spin-momentum locking with different orientations for the valence and conduction bands. Also, Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin Hall conductivity is the only non-zero term $(C_s=1$ and $C_v=0)$, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI). Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of non-trivial and trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Critical relaxational dynamics at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional spin models with ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.</p>

            <h2>The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Laura Celora, Ralf Blossey, Andreas Munch, Barbara Wagner</p>
            <p>We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</p>

            <p>Nucleation, the pivotal first step of crystallization, governs essential characteristics of crystallization products, including size distribution, morphology, and polymorphism. While understanding this process is paramount to the design of chemical, pharmaceutical and industrial production processes, major knowledge gaps remain, especially with respect to the crystallization of porous solids. Also for nanocrystalline ZIF-8, one of the most widely studied metal-organic frameworks, questions regarding the species involved in the nucleation pathway and their structural and chemical transformations remain unanswered. By combining harmonic light scattering, inherently sensitive to structural changes, with NMR spectroscopy, which reveals molecular exchanges between particles and solution, we were able to capture the crystallization mechanism of ZIF-8 in unprecedented detail. This dual approach provides concurrent structural and chemical insights, revealing key processes not previously observed in ZIF crystallization. Upon mixing small charged prenucleation clusters (PNCs) are formed, exhibiting an excess of ligands and net positive charge. We show that nucleation is initiated by aggregation of PNCs, through the release of ligands and associated protons to the liquid. This leads to the formation of charge neutral amorphous precursor particles (APPs) which incorporate neutral monomers from solution, and crystallize ZIF-8. Our work highlights chemical dynamics as a vital, yet often overlooked, dimension in the multi-stage structural evolution of MOFs. By establishing the critical role of PNCs in the nucleation of ZIF-8, new pathways open up for controlling crystallization of metal-organic frameworks through targeted chemical interactions with these species.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Lin Mai, Xiang-Yuan Cui, Tilmann Hickel, Jörg Neugebauer, Simon Ringer</p>
            <p>Segregation of alloying elements and impurities at grain boundaries (GBs) critically influences material behavior by affecting cohesion. In this study, we present an ab initio high-throughput evaluation of segregation energies and cohesive effects for all elements in the periodic table (Z: 1 to 92, H to U) across six model ferritic iron GBs using density functional theory (DFT). From these data, we construct comprehensive elemental maps for solute segregation tendencies and cohesion at GBs, providing guidance for segregation engineering. We systematically assess the cohesive effects of different elements in all segregating positions along multiple fracture paths with a quantum-chemistry bond-order method as well as a modified Rice-Wang theory of interfacial cohesion. The effects of segregants on the cohesion of GBs are shown to vary drastically as a function of site character, and hence their induced cohesive effects must be considered as a thermodynamic average over the spectral energy distribution. Thus, models that overlook these aspects may fail to accurately predict the impacts of varying alloying concentrations, thermal processing conditions, or GB types. The insights presented here, along with our accompanying dataset, are expected to advance our understanding of GB segregation in steels and other materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jennifer Coulter, Bogdan Rajkov, Michele Simoncelli</p>
            <p>Non-diffusive, hydrodynamic-like transport of charge or heat has been observed in several materials, and recent, pioneering experiments have suggested the possible emergence of electron-phonon bifluids. Here we introduce the first-principles theory and computational framework to describe these phenomena, showing that the viscosity of electron-phonon bifluids is microscopically determined by composite ``relaxon'' electron-phonon excitations that also describe electron-phonon drag effects on thermoelectric transport coefficients. We show that these composite excitations emerge from the microscopic coupled electron-phonon Boltzmann transport equation, and demonstrate that the latter can be coarse-grained into a set of mesoscopic Viscous Thermoelectric Equations (VTE). The VTE unify the established hydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys. Usp. 11 1968], and the recently developed Viscous Heat Equations for phonons [PRX 10, 2020], while also extending them to cover the mixed electron-phonon bifluid regime. We employ this framework to elucidate from first principles the conditions under which electron and phonon fluids can coexist and mix, as well as to rationalize experimental signatures of electron-phonon drag in graphite.</p>

            <p>We propose a digital-analog quantum algorithm for simulating the Hubbard-Holstein model, describing strongly-correlated fermion-boson interactions, in a suitable architecture with superconducting circuits. It comprises a linear chain of qubits connected by resonators, emulating electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-p) interactions, as well as fermion tunneling. Our approach is adequate for a digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) of fermion-boson models including those described by the Hubbard-Holstein model. We show the reduction in the circuit depth of the DAQC algorithm, a sequence of digital steps and analog blocks, outperforming the purely digital approach. We exemplify the quantum simulation of a half-filling two-site Hubbard-Holstein model. In such example we obtain fidelities larger than 0.98, showing that our proposal is suitable to study the dynamical behavior of solid-state systems. Our proposal opens the door to computing complex systems for chemistry, materials, and high-energy physics.</p>

            <p>The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrei I. Pavlov, Yuval Gefen, Alexander Shnirman</p>
            <p>Complex spectra of dissipative quantum systems may exhibit degeneracies known as exceptional points (EPs). At these points the systems' dynamics may undergo drastic changes. Phenomena associated with EPs and their applications have been extensively studied in relation to various experimental platforms, including, i.a., the superconducting circuits. While most of the studies focus on EPs appearing due to the variation of the system's physical parameters, we focus on EPs emerging in the full counting statistics of the system. We consider a monitored three level system and find multiple EPs in the Lindbladian eigenvalues considered as functions of a counting field. These "hidden" EPs are not accessible without the insertion of the counting field into the Linbladian, i.e., if only the density matrix of the system is studied. Nevertheless, we show that the "hidden" EPs are accessible experimentally. We demonstrate that these EPs signify transitions between different topological classes which are rigorously characterized in terms of the braid theory. Furthermore, we identify dynamical observables affected by these transitions and demonstrate how experimentally measured quantum jump distributions can be used to spot transitions between different topological regimes. Additionally, we establish a duality between the conventional Lindbladian EPs (zero counting field) and some of the "hidden" ones. Our findings allow for easier experimental observations of the EP transitions, normally concealed by the Lindbladian steady state, without applying postselection schemes. These results can be directly generalized to any monitored open system as long as it is described within the Lindbladian formalism.</p>

            <p>A first principles machine learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed SCAN-ML, reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semi-empirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the study of reactive crystallization pathways in calcium carbonate, which are currently poorly understood.</p>

            <h2>Optimal Conversion from Classical to Quantum Randomness via Quantum Chaos</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wai-Keong Mok, Tobias Haug, Adam L. Shaw, Manuel Endres, John Preskill</p>
            <p>Quantum many-body systems provide a unique platform for exploring the rich interplay between chaos, randomness, and complexity. In a recently proposed paradigm known as deep thermalization, random quantum states of system A are generated by performing projective measurements on system B following chaotic Hamiltonian evolution acting jointly on AB. In this scheme, the randomness of the projected state ensemble arises from the intrinsic randomness of the outcomes when B is measured. Here we propose a modified scheme, in which classical randomness injected during the protocol is converted by quantum chaos into quantum randomness of the resulting state ensemble. We show that for generic chaotic systems this conversion is optimal in that each bit of injected classical entropy generates as much additional quantum randomness as adding an extra qubit to B. This significantly enhances the randomness of the projected ensemble without imposing additional demands on the quantum hardware. Our scheme can be easily implemented on typical analog quantum simulators, providing a more scalable route for generating quantum randomness valuable for many applications. In particular, we demonstrate that the accuracy of a shadow tomography protocol can be substantially improved.</p>

These models unify various constructions of hierarchical dual-unitary and triunitary gates and present new families of models with solvable correlations and entanglement dynamics. Using multilayer constructions of biunitary connections, we additionally introduce multilayer circuits with monoclinic symmetry and higher level hierarchical dual-unitary solvability and discuss their (non-)ergodicity. Our work demonstrates how different classes of solvable models can be understood as arising from different geometric structures in spacetime.</p>

            <p>Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthy functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes can lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired oscillations. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DADs usually come with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimp-shaped regions of the parameter space. However, in our system, multiple periodic attractors live within a shrimp-shaped region, giving it an internal structure made of infinite transitions between periodicities forming a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could be useful in unveiling the characteristics of heart myocyte behaviors that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahnaz Farhat, Denis Périce, Sören Petrat</p>
            <p>The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dragan Marković, Mihailo Čubrović</p>
            <p>We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl</p>
            <p>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Yang, Gabriel Cardoso, Thors Hans Hansson, Qing-Dong Jiang</p>
            <p>We investigate the influence of quantum fluctuations in a chiral cavity on the quantum Hall (QH) state, extending previous studies of QH liquids in linearly polarized cavities. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for perturbative cavity-matter interaction, we identify the system's normal modes, which correspond to the elementary excitations of the dressed electrons and photons. In contrast to the linear case, we find that the chiral cavity modifies the Kohn mode frequency by a contribution proportional to the cyclotron frequency, which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the magnetic field by cavity fluctuations. We show that the AC conductivities display cavity-induced corrections, including an isotropic quantum reactance effect and a rotating total-current response under applied AC fields. These findings are also derived from a hydrodynamic approach, which extends their validity to fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we examine the role of finite cavity quality factor and find that while photon losses introduce resistive contributions to the impedance, these vanish in the DC limit. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum Hall states and chiral cavities, with significant implications for material engineering and cavity-induced topological effects.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the fidelity between two states with different Chern numbers $\mathcal Z = \mathrm{tr} \{ \rho \rho' \} $ serves as a generating theory for an effective conformal field theory (CFT) at the $(2+0)d$ temporal interface. $\rho$ can be chosen as a pure trivial insulator, and $\rho'$ can be taken as a pure or dephased Chern insulator density matrix. More specifically, we obtain the following results: (1) through evaluation of the effective central charge, stiffness, and correlation function (the ``strange correlators"), we demonstrate that the fidelity between a trivial insulator and an insulator with Chern number $C=1$ maps to a CFT with effective central charge $c_{\rm eff} = 1$; while the fidelity between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ maps to a CFT with $c_{\rm eff} = 2$. (2) The density matrix of the Chern insulator becomes a quantum spin Hall insulator in the doubled Hilbert space, and the dephasing acts as interaction between the two spin species. (3) In the limit of infinite dephasing the Chern insulator becomes a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space, featuring the ``strong-weak" U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking. The analysis based on Laughlin wave function and previous studies of projected wave function of quantum spin Hall insulator suggest this is a power-law superconductor. (4) With increasing strength of dephasing, the amplitude of single particle strange correlator is suppressed, while the Cooper pair strange correlator is enhanced, consistent with the trend of emerging superconductivity.</p>

            <p>The emerging ferroelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures are at the forefront of science and prospective technology. In moiré bilayers, twisting or heterostructuring causes local atomic reconstruction, which even at picometer scale, can lead to pronounced ferroelectric polarization. Accurately determining this reconstruction utilizing ab initio methods is unfeasible for the relevant system sizes, but modern machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a viable solution. Here, we present the Gaussian Approximation Potential for twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers validated against ab initio datasets. This approach enables the precise analysis of their structural properties, which is particularly relevant at small twist angles. We couple the structural information to a tight-binding model based on accurate interatomic positioning, and determine the twist-dependent polarization, yielding results that closely align with previous experimental findings - even at room temperature. This methodology enables further studies that are unattainable otherwise and is transferable to other 2D materials of interest.</p>

            <p>Carbon's versatility allows it to form diverse structures with unique properties, driven by its moderate electronegativity, small ionic radius, and ability to adopt \textit{sp}, \textit{sp\textsuperscript{2}}, and \textit{sp\textsuperscript{3}} hybridizations, individually or in combination. In this work, we introduce three novel 2D carbon allotropes -- $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$-anthraphenylenes -- derived from biphenylene and Dewar-anthracene motifs, investigated through density functional theory calculations. Their thermodynamic and dynamic stability are confirmed by cohesive energy ($-7.02$ to $-7.26$ eV/atom), phonon dispersion, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations. The electronic structure analysis shows that all three anthraphenylenes display metallic behavior. All anthraphenylenes feature type-II Dirac Line Nodes (DLNs). Mechanical analysis highlights significant anisotropy, mainly in $\gamma$-anthraphenylene, which exhibits the highest rigidity. These monolayers feature a porous architecture with tunable mechanical properties, making them promising candidates for nanoelectronics and energy storage applications. By expanding the family of 2D carbon materials, anthraphenylenes provide new avenues for functional nanomaterial design.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials have attracted considerable interest due to their diverse structural and electronic properties, making them ideal for next-generation flat electronics. Among these materials, metallic-like porous structures offer advantages such as tunable charge transport and high surface area, which are essential for energy storage applications. In this study, we introduce beta-naphthyne, a novel 2D carbon allotrope composed of naphthyl units interconnected by octagonal rings. First-principles calculations confirm its dynamic and thermal stability, demonstrating its theoretical feasibility. Our results confirm its energetic, dynamic, and mechanical stability and its metallic nature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Young's modulus ranges from 46.60 N/m to 164.47 N/m, indicating an anisotropic mechanical response. Optical analysis reveals absorption activity in the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions. The 1D structures were also analyzed, revealing a Dirac cone and a transition from metallic to semiconducting behavior. These findings establish beta-naphthyne as a promising material for energy storage and optoelectronic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Dirac node pinning from Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a Kagome spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ajesh Kumar, Byungmin Kang, Patrick A. Lee</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on the Kagome spin liquid candidate YCOB suggest the presence of Dirac fermionic spinons near the magnetization plateau at 1/9. Theories suggest that the spinons are charge neutral spin-$1/2$ excitations, in a $2\pi/3$ flux which triples the unit cell. Generally a gap is expected, and there is no symmetry protection for the Dirac nodes in this system. The question arises as to what causes the nodes and stabilizes them. In this work, we propose a node-creation and node-pinning mechanism driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Employing Gutzwiller-projected variational Monte Carlo calculations, we demonstrate that DM interactions induce a band closing phase transition in the spinon spectrum. There is a change in the Chern number when the bands are inverted. Together with the DM-generated internal gauge flux, the coupling to the spinon orbital magnetization counteracts the band reopening. This interplay energetically pins the Dirac nodes over a range of parameters.</p>

            <h2>Quantum critical point followed by Kondo-like behavior due to Cu substitution in itinerant, antiferromagnet ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atreyee Das, Siham Mohamed, Raquel A. Ribeiro, Tyler J. Slade, Juan Schmidt, Sergey L. Bud'ko, Paul C. Canfield</p>
            <p>$\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ is an itinerant magnet with a small saturated moment of $\sim$ 0.1 $\mu_{B}/\text{Ni}$ and a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at $T_1$ = 61.0 K, $T_2$ = 56.5 K and $T_3$ = 42.2 K. Temperature and field dependent measurements suggest a complex, anisotropic $H-T$ phase diagram with multiple phase lines. Here we present the growth and characterization of single crystals of the ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ series for 0 $\leq x \leq$ 0.181. Using a suite of anisotropic magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic measurements we study the evolution of the three AFM transitions upon Cu substitution. For ${0 \leq x \leq 0.097}$, the system remains magnetically ordered at base temperature with $x \leq$ 0.012, showing signs of three primarily AFM phases. For the higher substitution levels, ${0.125 \leq x \leq 0.181}$, there are no signatures of magnetic ordering, but an anomalous feature in resistance and heat capacity data are observed which are consistent with the Kondo effect in this system. The intermediate $x$ = 0.105 sample lies in between the magnetic ordered and the Kondo regime and is in the vicinity of the AFM-quantum critical point (QCP). Thus, ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ is an example of a small moment system that can be tuned through a QCP. Given these data combined with the fact that the $\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ structure has kagome-like, Ni-sublattice running perpendicular to the crystallographic $c-$ axis, and a $3d$-electron flat band that contributes to the density of states near the Fermi energy, it becomes a promising candidate to host and study exotic physics.</p>

            <p>We present a combined density functional theory (DFT), one-step model of photoemission, and soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) study of the electronic structure of the quaternary borocarbide superconductor YNi$_2$B$_2$C.

We show that DFT and the full potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) with average Coulomb interaction U = 3.0 eV and the exchange energy J = 0.9 eV applied to the Ni d-states are necessary for reproducing the experimentally observed SX-ARPES spectra.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katherine A. Koch, Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Martin Gomez-Dominguez, Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, Carlos Silva-Acuna, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada</p>
            <p>Exciton-exciton interactions are fundamental to the light-emitting properties of semiconductors, influencing applications from lasers to quantum light sources. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic signatures and binding energy of biexcitons in a metal halide two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper structure, which is known for hosting distinct excitonic resonances with unique lattice coupling. Using three spectroscopic techniques - photoluminescence (PL) and two variations of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) - we map coherent one-quantum and two-quantum correlations to gain deeper insight into the biexciton characteristics. While PL spectroscopy is hindered by spectral broadening and reabsorption, 2DES provides a more accurate characterization, revealing multiple biexciton states and uncovering a mixed biexciton species arising from exciton cross-coupling. These findings highlight the importance of advanced spectroscopic approaches in accurately determining biexciton binding energies and offer new perspectives on many-body interactions in exciton-polarons within layered perovskites.</p>

            <h2>Tunable resonant s-p mixing of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Igor Zutic</p>
            <p>Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Exchange-Coupled Spins for Robust High-Temperature Qubits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aniruddha Chakraborty, Md. Fahim F. Chowdhury, Mohamad Niknam, Louis S. Bouchard, Jayasimha Atulasimha</p>
            <p>We show that Heisenberg exchange interactions between the neighboring spins comprising an ensemble spin qubit (E-qubit) can act as an intrinsic error mitigator, increasing gate fidelity even at high temperatures. As an example, the fidelity of a {\pi} gate applied to E-qubits above 1 K was studied by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange strength to show an exchange coupled E-qubit exhibits higher fidelity than a single-spin based qubit. We also investigate the coherence properties of E-qubits and find that the coherence time of an E-qubit extends linearly with the number of spins in the ensemble. This suggests that exchange interactions effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise, achieving a coherence time greater than 1 ms at 1 K with an ensemble of only seven spins. Additionally, the ferromagnetic isotropic exchange prevents fidelity loss induced by spatial field gradients/inhomogeneity in Zeeman and/or control fields. Therefore, exchange-coupled spin qubits could enable fault-tolerant quantum operations and long-coherence times at elevated temperatures (>1 K).</p>

            <h2>Comprehensive landscape and simple rules for transition-metal Heusler semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubo Zhang, Zirui Dong, Jun Luo</p>
            <p>Heusler alloys, renowned for their multifunctionality and capacity for vast elemental customization, are primarily classified into half-Heusler (XYZ) and full-Heusler (X2YZ) structural types. Typically, the 18-electron half-Heusler and the 24-electron full-Heusler alloys are recognized as semiconductors, following the Slater-Pauling rule. Semiconductors are desired for many applications, but they represent a minor portion compared to the predominantly metallic and half-metallic members of the Heusler family. To broaden the scope of Heusler semiconductors, advancements have been made in developing variants such as double-half Heuslers XX'Y2Z2 and quaternary full Heuslers XX'YZ, which incorporate four constituent elements. Recently, vacancy-filling off-stoichiometric Heuslers of ternary X1+bYZ (0 <= b <= 1) and quaternary XaX'bYZ (1 <= a + b <= 2) have emerged as a more versatile strategy. However, the flexibility associated with off-stoichiometry inevitably leads to complications, including issues with fractional filling ratios and complex site occupations. This work presents a comprehensive landscape of transition-metal-containing Heusler semiconductors, focusing on the off-stoichiometric Heuslers but seamlessly encompassing the integer-stoichiometric systems. The structural and electronic properties can be theoretically understood through a few simple rules. Many systems have been experimentally validated, showcasing their potential for applications such as thermoelectric converters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minh T. P. Nguyen, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen, Stefano Bosco</p>
            <p>Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Rare-earth containing wide band gap oxides, which provide spin-photon interface and narrow linewidth optical emission, are getting significant attention as the most promising candidate materials in advancing quantum transduction and memories. Here, from $ab~initio$ calculations, we identify antiferromagnetic ground states in structurally preferred monoclinic CePO$_4$ and tetragonal CeVO$_4$ exhibiting localized occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states with $4f-4f$ transition characteristics. Interestingly, in CePO$_4$, O $2p$ and P $3p$ states hybridize negligibly with Ce $4f$ states, while in CeVO$_4$, V $3d$ and O $2p$ states hybridize and appear as extended states in between the occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states. Here, phonon calculations and analysis identify and differentiate Raman active phonon modes along with the spin phonon coupling of Ce in both CePO$_4$ and CeVO$_4$ that ultimately lead to different $4f$ ground state crystal field multiplets, which are critical to accurately describe electronic transitions for foundational quantum transduction and memories. Further, the identified $C_1$ site symmetry of Ce, lacking inversion symmetry in CePO$_4$, is relevant for quantum memories and $D_{2d}$ site symmetry of Ce exhibiting inversion symmetry in CeVO$_4$ is relevant for quantum transduction.</p>

            <p>The exploration of topological phases remains a cutting-edge research frontier, driven by their promising potential for next-generation electronic and quantum technologies. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling to systematically investigate the topological properties of freestanding two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb Bi, HgTe, and Al2O3(0001)-supported HgTe. Remarkably, all three systems exhibit coexistence of first-order and higher-order topological insulator states, manifested by gapless edge states in one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbons and symmetry-related corner states in zero-dimensional (0D) nanoflakes. Furthermore, fractional electron charges may accumulate at the corners of armchair-edged nanoflakes. Among these materials, HgTe/Al2O3(0001) is particularly promising due to its experimentally feasible atomic configuration and low-energy corner states. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring higher-order topological phases in Z_2 quantum spin Hall insulators and pave the way for new possibilities in device applications.</p>

            <p>It is shown that the flow of electric current in an altermagnet results in the formation of a homogeneous electron spin orientation in the sample. The spin of the conduction electrons generated in altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-momentum couplings, is quadratic in the current magnitude, varies as the second angular harmonic under variation of the current direction and does not require broken inversion symmetry. The effect is thus distinct from conventional current induced spin polarization phenomena which are linear in the current, vary as a first angular harmonic under variation of current direction and require broken inversion symmetry. The current-induced spin orientation in altermagnets is obtained using the kinetic theory for distribution functions in the spin-splitted subbands. It is shown that an application of external magnetic field significantly enhances the electron spin.</p>

            <p>Beyond the study of individual materials, their interfaces and arising functionality are crucial enablers of fundamental science and technological applications. Recently, the arena of two-dimensional (2D) materials was extended to so-called non-van der Waals (non-vdW) compounds derived from strongly bonded non-layered bulk crystals. These nanosystems with their active surfaces complement now - through their chemically bonded heterostructure (HS) interfaces - the established space of weakly interacting vdW HSs. Here, we study a wide range of 55 candidate non-vdW HSs with autonomous density functional calculations and find that the resulting interfacial chemical hybridization and bonding is the key factor determining their electronic and magnetic properties. It gives rise to the formation of hybrid interface bands, strong magnetic coupling, and substantial electronic as well as magnetic moire surface property modulations upon twisting. Our work thus provides a significant step towards charting the new interface class of non-vdW HSs.</p>

            <p>Few concentrated disordered binary metallic alloys show a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), which is quite unusual. V$_{0.3}$Ti$_{0.7}$ is one such alloy that shows resistivity exceeding 100 $\mu\Omega$ cm and exhibits negative TCR. The addition of ferromagnetic rare-earth Gd, which is insoluble in the body-centered cubic V-Ti matrix, changes the negative TCR to positive (when Gd conc. $\geq$ 2 at.$\%$). Evidence of spin polarization of conduction electrons of the V-Ti matrix by Gd clusters is obtained from the magnetization experiments as well as from the anomalous component of the Hall effect. Our analysis suggests that the additional scattering due to the distribution in the electron-spin fluctuation interaction arising from the substitution of titanium in vanadium is the origin of the negative TCR. The Gd clusters polarize the conduction electrons, leading to the suppression of spin fluctuations, resulting in the positive TCR.</p>

The phase space reconstruction relies on phase transitions derived from the Luttinger-Ward functional, which accounts for interactions that are forbidden by perturbation theory.

            <p>Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</p>

            <p>The structural and physical properties of two single-grain Au-Al-Gd 1/1 approximant crystals (ACs) with analyzed compositions Au73.67Al12.24Gd14.09 and Au74.67Al11.35Gd13.98 were thoroughly investigated. The two variants are iso-structural (cubic, space group: Im-3 undergoing sharp antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at TN = 9.6 K and TN = 8.3 K, respectively. Specific heat measurements in both samples evidenced sharp jump at TN, associated with the AFM transition, accompanied by broad Schottky-type anomalies at lower temperatures. Strikingly, the two 1/1 ACs exhibited markedly different responses to applied magnetic fields: one displayed a pronounced metamagnetic anomaly while the other did not. In this regard, variational calculations with adiabatic transformation of the magnetic field in realistic structural models identified the existence of two possible AFM phases: the cuboc phase with a metamagnetic anomaly and the cluster Néel phase without it, thereby clearly revealing the possible magnetic structures of the present AFM variants. These findings have led to the establishment of a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram for Heisenberg-type 1/1 ACs. This work not only advances our understanding of magnetic phase transitions in these complex systems but also suggests the existence of a broader spectrum of unexplored magnetic states in Tsai-type materials.</p>

            <p>The gatemon qubits, made of transparent super-semi Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such "gateless gatemon" qubits can be driven with Rabi frequencies more than 100 MHz, enabling gate operations much faster than what is possible with traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our gateless gatemons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent super-semi junctions bring to quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.</p>

            <p>We compare three model-free numerical methods for inverting structural data to obtain interaction potentials, namely iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI), test-particle insertion (TPI), and a machine-learning (ML) approach called ActiveNet. Three archetypal models of two-dimensional colloidal systems are used as test cases: Weeks--Chandler--Anderson short-ranged repulsion, the Lennard-Jones potential, and a repulsive shoulder interaction with two length scales. Additionally, data on an experimental suspension of colloidal spheres are acquired by optical microscopy and used to test the inversion methods. The methods have different merits. IBI is the only choice when the radial distribution function is known but particle coordinates are unavailable. TPI requires snapshots with particle positions and can extract both pair- and higher-body potentials without the need for simulation. The ML approach can only be used when particles can be tracked in time and it returns the force rather than the potential. However, it can unravel pair interactions from any one-body forces (such as drag or propulsion) and does not rely on equilibrium distributions for its derivation.

            <h2>Reduction of current for magnetization switching in a nanomagnet with perpendicular anisotropy by spin-splitter torque</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomoki Watanabe, Keisuke Yamada, Yoshinobu Nakatani</p>
            <p>Recently, spin-transfer torque (STT) based magnetization switching has been widely utilized in magnetic resistance-based memories, which have broad applications in microcontroller units and other devices. This study utilizes a macrospin model to simulate magnetization switching in nanoscale magnets with perpendicular anisotropy through spin-splitter torque (SST). The study primarily addresses minimizing the current for magnetization switching and identifying the conditions necessary for achieving high switching probabilities. Notably, the threshold current density for SST-induced magnetization switching is reduced by approximately 75-80% compared to conventional STT and spin-orbit torque mechanisms, provided the spin torque polar angle is optimized. For practical implementation in magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), a polar angle exceeding roughly 128 degrees must be maintained to ensure sufficient switching probability. Additionally, optimizing the shape of the applied current pulse significantly lowers the switching per rate by approximately 18 times. These findings underscore the effectiveness of SST in reducing magnetization switching currents and offer valuable insights into its potential application in SST-MRAM technology.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocity and multibody interactions in acoustically levitated particle systems: A three body problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brady Wu, Qinghao Mao, Bryan VanSaders, Heinrich M. Jaeger</p>
            <p>In active fluids and active solids the constituents individually generate movement by each extracting energy from their environment or from their own source. Non-reciprocal interactions among these active constituents then enable novel collective behavior that often can be strikingly counterintuitive. However, non-reciprocity in these cases typically requires that the interacting bodies have different physical properties or it needs to be programmed explicitly into all pairwise interactions. Here we show that collective activity in a driven system can emerge spontaneously through multibody nonreciprocal forces, even if all bodies are individually non-active and have identical properties. We demonstrate this with as few as three identical spheres, acoustically levitated in air, which exhibit collective activity as they interact through non-pairwise forces: similar to the classic gravitational three-body problem, the interaction between two spheres depends sensitively on the relative position of the third sphere. Non-reciprocity arises naturally from both near-field sound scattering and microstreaming forces among the spheres. The underdamped dynamics in air furthermore make it possible to go beyond collective center-of-mass propulsion or rotation and observe internal, engine-like reconfigurations that follow limit cycles. These findings open up new possibilities for self-assembly, where now multibody interactions not only determine the resulting structure but also drive the spontaneously emerging dynamics.</p>

            <p>Owing to the intrinsically high crystallization temperatures, layered phase-change materials, such as CrGeTe3 and InGeTe3, are attracting attention for embedded memory applications, In addition to the electrical contrast, a major change in magnetic properties is observed in CrGeTe3 upon switching from the crystalline to the amorphous state. In this work, we report a combined ab initio modeling and magnetic characterization study on the isostructural silicon parent compound of CrGeTe3, namely, CrSiTe3. Amorphous CrSiTe3 has similar structural properties to amorphous CrGeTe3; however, it shows a smaller energy difference between the ferromagnetic configuration and the random magnetic configuration, indicating a high probability of spin glass formation. Indeed, direct-current and alternating-current magnetic measurements show that the coercive force of amorphous CrSiTe3 is higher than that of amorphous CrGeTe3. Therefore, the pinning effect of spins is enhanced in amorphous CrSiTe3, leading to a more robust spin glass state with a higher freezing temperature. The large magnetic contrast between the amorphous and crystalline phase could make CrSiTe3 a potential candidate for phase-change magnetic switching applications.</p>

            <h2>Stability of quasi-particle creation and multiband geometry in fractional Chern insulators under magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nozomi Higashino, Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets with vanishing magnetization, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. Upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE significantly increases and exceeds the conventional limits of AHE of intrinsic origin. Additionally, we observe a topological Hall effect (THE) that emerges in the conical magnetic phase. Notably, the THE in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ persists over an extended magnetic field range of up to 25~T. Our detailed transport measurements highlight the need for theoretical modeling to explain the observations of AHE and THE in $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$= Rare earth) family of compounds.</p>

            <h2>A Bond weighted tensor renormalization group study of the q-state ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Heng Tseng, Shang-Wei Li, Fu-Jiun Jiang</p>
            <p>It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$. Despite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a first-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the quantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of $Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a signal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak should diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned divergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario of a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a recent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model observes that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes more noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of coexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual critical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat $C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of bond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose, $q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are investigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply there may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the mentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear with a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a message of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect requires further and detailed investigations.</p>

            <p>The frustrated honeycomb spin model can stabilize a subextensively degenerate spiral spin liquid with nontrivial topological excitations and defects, but its material realization remains rare. Here, we report the experimental realization of this model in the structurally disorder-free compound GdZnPO. Using a single-crystal sample, we find that spin-7/2 rare-earth Gd$^{3+}$ ions form a honeycomb lattice with dominant second-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic and first-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings, along with easy-plane single-site anisotropy. This frustrated model stabilizes a unique spiral spin liquid with a degenerate contour around the $\mathrm{K}$$\{$1/3,1/3$\}$ point in reciprocal space, consistent with our experiments down to 30 mK, including the observation of a giant residual specific heat. Our results establish GdZnPO as an ideal platform for exploring the stability of spiral spin liquids and their novel properties, such as the emergence of low-energy topological defects on the sublattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Frank Lechermann, Steffen Bötzel, Ilya M. Eremin</p>
            <p>Developing a low-energy model is essential for understanding unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here, we analyze distinct low-energy scenarios of the normal state by downfolding the ab-initio determined band structure and applying the mean-field regime of rotational-invariant slave-boson theory. We compare models based on the single-site two-orbital, the two-site four-orbital and a proposed minimal cluster (MC) picture. The latter builds up on three adapted orbitals located on the sites of the basic Ni-O-Ni cluster across the bilayer. Intriguing interplay between the Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the interlayer exchange $J_{\perp}$ is encountered in the multiorbital multi-site problem. While the tendency for interlayer Ni-$d_{z^2}$ singlet formation is pronounced, a complete localization remains hindered by the coupling to the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. The correlation physics in the MC picture is peculiar with respect to the effective interorbital/site exchange.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal nitrides have a wide prospect of applications in the fields of physics, chemistry, materials, etc. However, 2D transition metal nitrides with strong magnetism, especially high N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature, are very scarce. Based on the first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional theory, we design two 2D transition-metal nitrides \textit{M}$_2$N$_2$ (\textit{M} = Ti, Co), in which the transition metal atoms and the N atoms form a 2D layer with a wrinkled structure. The structural stability is demonstrated by the cohesive energy, formation energy, elastic constants, phonon spectra and molecular dynamics simulations. Elastic moduli calculations reveal that the mechanical properties of the two structures are anisotropic. Spin-polarized calculations show that Ti$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D ferromagnetic material while Co$_2$N$_2$ is a 2D antiferromagnetic semimetal with a Dirac point at Fermi level. Furthermore, by solveing the Heisenberg model by Monte Carlo method, we discover that the 2D Co$_2$N$_2$ layer is a high-temperature antiferromagnetic material and the N$\rm \acute{e}$el temperature is up to 474 K. Therefore, our findings provide a rare antiferromagnetic 2D material with both high critical temperature and Dirac Fermions.</p>

The width of the domain wall is a non-monotonic function of the velocity and it diverges to infinity at $v_c$. Both features are in contrast to the case of the Lorentz invariant model in the absence of the field. We further study the modification of the wall profile when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is added. Finally, we present a propagating spiral expected to form when the system is forced at a velocity higher than the maximum velocity for domain walls and we give numerical results for the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</p>

            <p>Point defects, though atomically small, significantly influence the properties of 2D materials. A general method for characterizing point defect density ($n_{ D }$) in graphenic materials with arbitrary layer number ($n_{ L }$) is currently lacking. Here, we introduce the Graphene Atlas, a non-destructive Raman spectroscopy-based framework for defect quantification in diverse graphenic systems. We demonstrate that the relative fractions of the double-resonance D and 2D Raman bands, which arise from competing scattering processes, exhibit a universal relationship with $n_{ D }$, independent of $n_{ L }$. Plotting Raman data on a plane defined by defect-related and layer number-related parameters enables a direct and quantitative determination of $n_{ D }$ and $n_{ L }$. This Graphene Atlas provides a transformative tool for real-time defect quantification in scalable manufacturing of graphenic materials, bridging fundamental research and industrial applications. This framework establishes a new standard for defect characterization of graphenic systems, facilitating their optimization for advanced technological applications.</p>

This entanglement is estimated from the quantum Fisher information and, avoiding the ill-conditioned analytical continuation, the quantum variance. Both are lower bounds for the actual entanglement that can be calculated from the (antiferromagnetic) susceptibility, obtained here with the dynamical vertex approximation. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental neutron scattering experiments for various cuprates. Theory predicts a $\ln(1/T)$ divergence of the entanglement for low temperatures $T$, which is however cut-off by the onset of superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yingze Su, Ruitao Xiao, Junnian Xiong, Hui Li, Huaqing Huang, Dingping Li</p>
            <p>In the theoretical study of two-dimensional systems, difficulties emerge as that quantum phase transitions at zero temperature cause low- and high-temperature scenarios to belong to different branches, while the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking at finite temperatures, excluding a Landau phase transition marked by a critical temperature $T_c$. In many-body theory, fundamental symmetries like Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI), Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem (FDT), and Pauli-repulsive principle must be satisfied, yet widely-used approximate theories struggle to meet them simultaneously. We introduce a symmetrization theory that, by using spurious broken phases from approximate theories, can naturally generate different low- and high-temperature branches. Employing the GW method beyond mean-field and the covariance scheme, which strictly satisfy WTI and FDT, we numerically show that the violation of Pauli-repulsive principle is significantly less than that in mean-field, and further restore Pauli-repulsive principle without breaking WTI and FDT. By calculating symmetrized one-body Green's function and two-body correlation function and comparing them with accurate results from Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we demonstrate its numerical accuracy at low temperatures and strong coupling. This symmetrization theory can be easily applied to other two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.</p>

            <p>Copper and hydrogen are among the most common elements that are widely used in industrial and fundamental research applications. Copper surfaces are often exposed to hydrogen in the form of charged ions. The hydrogen ions can accelerate towards the surface, resulting in an accumulation of hydrogen below the surface. Harmless in low concentrations, prolonged hydrogen exposure can lead to dramatic changes on copper surfaces. This effect is visible to the naked eye in the form of blisters densely covering the exposed surface. Blisters are structural modifications that can affect the physical properties of the surface including, for example, vacuum dielectric strength. Using scanning electron microscopy we found that the blistering of the irradiated polycrystalline copper surface does not grow uniformly with ion fluence. Initially, only some grains exhibit blisters, while others remain intact. Our experiments indicate that grains with the 100 orientation are the most prone to blistering, while the grains oriented in the 110 are the most resistant to it. Moreover, we noticed that blisters assume different shapes correlating with specific grain orientation. Good agreement of experiments with the atomistic simulations explains the difference in the shapes of the blisters by specific behavior of dislocations within the FCC crystal structure. Moreover, our simulations reveal the correlation of the delay in blister formation on surfaces with certain orientations compared to the others with the dependence of the hydrogen penetration depth and the depth and amount of vacancies in copper on the orientation of the irradiated surface.</p>

            <p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Their diverse compositions and structures offer a wide range of applications, such as electrical conductivity and diffusion, which can be optimized by tuning the combination of different building blocks. The ease of modifying metal centers or organic linkers makes MOFs ideal for property prediction and inverse material design through computational modeling. Data science driven techniques can aid in the exploration of novel structures with optimize properties by employing machine learning models and using available simulation data in the literature. Here, we provide an extensive data collection with the simulation of MOFs, derived from the QMOF database, based on density-functional-theory, along with their corresponding tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian, offering insights into the electronic structure of each material. The topology information is augmented by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors which are used as fingerprints of the local environment. Besides, the Extended Hubbard model is also used to describe a sub-set of MOFs with transition metals, where the Hubbard parameters intra-site U and inter-site V are computed. Due to the highly computational cost associated with the Hubbard calculations and the comprehensive amount of data for the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the database provided here stands as a significant contribution not only for the training of ML models to predict new properties but also to perform inverse design of new MOFs with enhanced target properties.</p>

            <p>Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</p>

In the creep layer, $\alpha$ decreases with depth, reaching $\alpha \approx -1.5$ at approximately 55 mean particle diameters, consistent with the SOC model with closed boundaries ($\alpha \approx -1.58$). Analysis of the fluctuation velocity distributions offers additional insights into the microscopic origins of the spectrum's characteristics.

            <p>The recent experimental realization of emergent quasi-particles, such as spinons, doublons, and quartons, in a spin-$1/2$ trimer chain has spurred new interest in low dimensional magnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of the isotropic spin-$1$ trimer chain with intra and inter-trimer antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, ($J >0$ and $J' >0$), respectively, unveiling various quasi-particles: magnons, singletons, triplons, pentons, and heptons. For weak inter-trimer exchange coupling $J'/J \ll 1$, it behaves as an effective spin-$1$ chain with valence bond solid (VBS) ground state. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we compute the dynamic structure factor (DSF) which reveals a gapped magnon band alongside weakly dispersive singleton, excited triplon, and penton excitations. The evolution of these excitations with inter-trimer coupling $J'$ is also examined, providing insight into the underlying excitation mechanisms. For spin-$1$ chain, these exotic quasi-particles eventually reduce to conventional magnon excitations as $J'/J \rightarrow 1$. Our results shed light on the rich and complex excitation spectrum of spin-$1$ trimer chains and offer new perspectives on the dynamics in quantum spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Impact and spreading dynamics of a drop of fiber suspension on a solid substrate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreeram Rajesh, Alban Sauret</p>
            <p>The presence of non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a liquid modifies the impact and spreading dynamics of a drop on a hydrophilic substrate. This difference in spreading dynamics is attributed to the increase in the suspension's viscosity caused by the particles. Similarly, anisotropic non-Brownian particles, such as fibers, also increase the bulk viscosity. In addition to the fiber diameter, D, the length, L, which determines the aspect ratio A = L/D, is crucial in controlling the fiber suspension viscosity. Therefore, we hypothesize that the drop impact of fiber suspensions with different volume fractions will result in a similar modification of the spreading dynamics. To investigate the impact and spreading dynamics, we prepared suspensions of fibers with an aspect ratio A = 12 at different volume fractions, spanning the dilute, semi-dilute, and dense concentration regimes. Additionally, we conducted a subset of experiments with aspect ratios A = 4 and A = 20. Furthermore, we characterized the thickness of the resulting droplet film (the coating) and the orientation of fibers after the spreading dynamics reached a steady state. The presence of fibers results in a decrease in the final droplet size, as an increase in volume fraction leads to an increase in the suspension viscosity. To rationalize these results, we used a modified equation, originally developed for spherical particles, which incorporates the suspension viscosity. Furthermore, we observed that volume fraction plays only a weak role in controlling splashing. However, it is crucial in determining the final thickness and resulting fiber coating. We also used a novel approach to quantify the final fiber orientation and showed that the resulting distribution is anisotropic within the quantified range.</p>

Here, we introduce an efficient and Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC) method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks inherent in conventional MC simulation algorithms, reducing the computational complexity of an MC sweep from cubic to linear. Leveraging the large degree of parallelization inherent in our method, we present a GPU accelerated implementation, SMC_GPU, which enables the simulation of atomistic systems exceeding one billion atoms while maintaining the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). Using this unprecedented capability, we perform large-scale thermodynamic simulations to investigate the microstructure evolution in the FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW high entropy alloys (HEAs). Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanoscale phenomena, including short-range and long-range order, nanoparticles, and nanophases. The size, composition, and morphology of these nanostructures, which can comprise millions of atoms and thus present significant challenges for traditional methods, are analyzed with high-accuracy atomistic simulations for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our simulations produce thermodynamic properties and nanostructures that align well with available theoretical and experimental data. More intriguingly, our results reveal that the intricate nanoscale interplay of order and disorder in HEA stems from the combined effects of chemical complexity and temperature.

            <h2>Velocity gauge formulation of nonlinear optical response in Floquet-driven systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Sajad Dabiri, Reza Asgari</p>
            <p>Using the velocity gauge formalism, we develop a theoretical framework for computing the nonlinear optical responses of time-periodic quantum systems. This approach complements the length gauge formulation and offers distinct advantages in both numerical and analytical treatments, particularly for atomic and solid-state systems with well-defined momentum-space structures. By applying our framework to the Rabi model, we derive numerical solutions in the velocity gauge and compare them with the length gauge, demonstrating full agreement between the two formulations. Our findings reveal rich optical phenomena, including photon-assisted transitions, frequency mixing effects, and emergent Floquet-induced photocurrents that are absent in static systems. We demonstrate that nonlinear responses in Floquet-driven systems exhibit resonances at integer multiples of the driving frequency, providing insights into ultrafast spectroscopy and Floquet engineering of quantum materials. The present formulation establishes a bridge between theoretical models and experimental observations in driven quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum optics, photonics, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by experiments on rhombohedral tetralayer graphene showing signs of superconductivity emerging from a valley-polarized normal state, we here analyze theoretically how scanning tunneling spectroscopy can be used to probe the superconducting order parameter of the system. To describe different pairing scenarios on equal footing, we develop a microscopic tunneling approach that can capture arbitrary, including finite-momentum, superconducting order parameters and low-symmetry normal-state Hamiltonians. Our analysis shows that the broken time-reversal symmetry in a single valley leads to unique features in the weak-tunneling regime that are different for commensurate and incommensurate Cooper pair momenta. We further uncover an unconventional spatial dependence of the Andreev conductance, allowing to distinguish between three topologically distinct classes of single-$\mathbf{q}$ pairing states in the system, and compute the signatures of a competing translational-symmetry breaking three-$\mathbf{q}$ ''moiré superconductor''.</p>

            <p>We evaluate theoretically the possibility to realize Majorana zero modes in hybrid devices made from topological-insulator (TI) nanowires proximity-coupled to a superconductor. Such systems have been suggested as building blocks of future topological quantum computers, as they have been predicted to realize Majorana zero modes protected by large gaps. A main obstacle is, however, the presence of a relatively large density of charged impurities, $n_\text{imp}\sim 10^{19}$cm$^{-3}$. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proximity to the superconductor leads to an efficient screening of the disorder potential. By analyzing the Majorana splitting energy, the size of the Andreev gap and the localization of edge modes, we show that robust Majorana modes can be realized for realistic levels of impurity concentrations and wire radii.</p>

            <h2>Shear jamming transition in alternating shear rotation for frictional and frictionless suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pappu Acharya, Martin Trulsson</p>
            <p>Alternating shear rotations in dense suspensions have recently shown the ability to reduce both viscosity and dissipation per strain (at a fixed global shear rate). Here, we study alternating shear rotation, with extensive numerical simulations, at various angles and up to their corresponding jamming points. For increasing shear rotation angles, we find that the jamming point is continuously shifted to higher packing fractions for frictional particles, while it remains constant for frictionless particles. As a consequence, the alternating shear rotation is unable to reduce the dissipation per strain for suspensions composed of frictionless particles. We detail the individual contributions, hydrodynamic or contact, to the shear stress, being uncharted for this protocol. As the angle of rotation increases, the average contact stress decreases. However, we find that the hydrodynamics shows the opposite trend, instead increasing with increasing angle. Hence, hydrodynamic stress will dominate up to much higher packing fractions as the angle of rotation increases. In addition, we report how the microstructure varies and establish a one-to-one mapping between the contact number and its contribution to the total stress for both frictionless and frictional particles.</p>

            <p>Excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, dominate the optical response of two-dimensional semiconductors across near-infrared and visible frequencies due to their large binding energy and prominent oscillator strength. Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.</p>

            <h2>Random motility regulation drives the fragmentation of microbial ecosystems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Dinelli, Ada Altieri, Julien Tailleur</p>
            <p>The self-organization of microbial ecosystems involves a large variety of mechanisms, ranging from biochemical signaling to population dynamics. Among these, the role of motility regulation has been little studied, despite the importance of active migration processes. Here we show how weak, random motility regulation generically induces the fragmentation of bacterial ecosystems comprising a large number of coexisting strains. To do so, we simulate microscopic models of run-and-tumble bacteria whose self-propulsion speeds are regulated by the local density of each strain. Our simulations reveal that, as the heterogeneity of the interaction network increases, the ecosystem undergoes a phase transition leading to the emergence of distinct communities. To account for these results and assess their robustness, we use random-matrix theory to analyze the hydrodynamic description of the bacterial ecosystem, obtaining a quantitative agreement with our microscopic simulations. Our results are shown to hold for a variety of motility-regulation mechanisms and should be relevant to the study of community formation by motile organisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darin Joseph, Cesare Franchini</p>
            <p>In this study, we investigate the formation of electron and hole small polarons in the prototypical ferroelectric material BaTiO3, with a focus on their interaction with ferroelectric distortive fields. To accurately describe the ferroelectric phase in electronically correlated BaTiO3, we employ the HSE06 hybrid functional, which addresses the limitations of conventional DFT and DFT+U models, providing a more precise depiction of both ferroelectric and polaronic behaviors. Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3: cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic. We uncover a unique phase-dependent trend in electron polaron stability, which progressively increases across the structural phases, peaking in the rhombohedral phase due to the constructive coupling between the polaron and ferroelectric phonon fields. In contrast, hole polarons exhibit a stability pattern largely unaffected by the phase transitions. Furthermore, we observe that polaron self-trapping significantly alters the local ferroelectric distortive pattern, which propagates to neighboring sites but has a minimal effect on the long-range macroscopic spontaneous polarization. Charge trapping is also associated with localized spin formation, opening new possibilities for enhanced functionalities in multiferroic materials.</p>

            <p>The study of gapless phases with categorical (or so-called non-invertible) symmetries is a formidable task, in particular in higher than two space-time dimensions. In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and arXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework to study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central tool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the SymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches", which realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. This requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the Ising transition for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation to a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for categorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory for a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories. We classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized gauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module this http URL is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW theories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically gapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking phases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Soejima, Junkai Dong, Daniel E. Parker, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</p>

            <p>As silicon-based computing approaches fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency, speed, and density, the search for complementary materials to extend or replace CMOS technology has become increasingly urgent. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides have been extensively investigated, van der Waals indium selenides--particularly InSe and In2Se3--offer a compelling alternative with distinct advantages for next-generation electronics. Unlike conventional 2D semiconductors, indium selenides combine exceptional electron mobility (exceeding 1,000 cm^2V^-1s^-1), high thermal velocity (>2x10^7 cm/s), thickness-tunable bandgaps (0.97-2.5 eV), and unique phase-dependent ferroelectric properties, enabling both high-performance logic and non-volatile memory functions within a single material system. This perspective critically evaluates the materials properties, fabrication challenges, and device applications of indium selenides, examining their potential to surpass silicon in ultra-scaled transistors through ballistic transport while simultaneously offering ferroelectric memory capabilities impossible in conventional semiconductors. We analyze recent breakthroughs in ballistic InSe transistors, tunnel field-effect transistors, and In2Se3-based ferroelectric devices for information storage, and identify key research priorities for addressing persistent challenges in scalable synthesis, phase control, and oxidation prevention. By bridging fundamental materials science with practical device engineering, we provide a roadmap for translating the exceptional properties of indium selenides into commercially viable, low-power computing technologies that can overcome the limitations of silicon while enabling novel computing architectures.</p>

            <h2>Energy Dispersion, Superconductivity and Magnetic Fluctuations in Stacked Altermagnetism Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun Chang, Hantao Lu, Jize Zhao, Hong-Gang Luo, Yang Ding</p>
            <p>Recently, altermagnetism (AM) has emerged as a new category of magnetism, alongside conventional antiferromagnetism (AFM) and ferromagnetism (FM). In an AM, superconductivity (SC) is faced with a dilemma that the spin-polarized bands, induced by the broken time reversal (T ) symmetry, dominantly supports spin-triplet pairing. In contrast, AM spin fluctuations routinely facilitate spin-singlet pairing as in AFM. Consequently, unconventional SC is either absent or weak in AM materials. Here, we propose that stacking 2D AM materials could resolve this dilemma. Stacked 2D materials have yielded a variety of new electronic properties by altering the symmetries inherent in the monolayer. In a 2D anisotropic Hubbard model, we investigate the general energy dispersions of both single-layer and stacked AM materials. We demonstrate that AM sheet stacking can alter the original symmetries, consequently affecting the energy dispersion. The interlayer magnetic coupling enhances the low q magnetic fluctuations. T symmetry is restored in the AA stacking with an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling, and then both the energy dispersion and pairing interaction are in favor of spin-singlet SC. The ferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the AB stacking not only recovers T symmetry but also supports spin-triplet pairing. It is further anticipated that twisted bilayer AM sheets could exhibit additional novel electronic properties, including topology, flat bands, and collective excitations. Our work illustrates that stacking sheets of AM materials could open up a unique research domain in exploring novel quantum phenomena and offer a fertile ground for potential electronic applications.</p>

            <p>The hydrogen ions in the superionic ice can move freely, playing the role of electrons in metals. Its electromagnetic behavior is the key to explaining the anomalous magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune. Based on the ab initio evolutionary algorithm, we searched for the stable H4O crystal structure under pressures of 500-5000 GPa and discovered a new layered chain $Pmn2_1$-H$_4$O structure with H$_3$ ion clusters. Interestingly, H3 ion clusters rotate above 900 K (with an instantaneous speed of 3000 m/s at 900 K), generating an instantaneous magnetic moment ($10^{-26}$ Am$^2 \approx 0.001 \mu_B$). Moreover, H ions diffuse in a direction perpendicular to the H-O atomic layer at 960-1000 K. This is because the hydrogen oxygen covalent bonds within the hydrogen oxygen plane hinder the diffusion behavior of H$_3$ ion clusters within the plane, resulting in the diffusion of H$_3$ ion clusters between the hydrogen oxygen planes and the formation of a one-dimensional conductive superionic state. One-dimensional diffusion of ions may generate magnetic fields. We refer to these two types of magnetic moments as "thermal-induced ion magnetic moments". When the temperature exceeds 1000 K, H ions diffuse in three directions. When the temperature exceeds 6900 K, oxygen atoms diffuse and the system becomes fluid. These findings provide important references for people to re-recognize the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen under high pressure, as well as the sources of abnormal magnetic fields in Uranus and Neptune.</p>

Many of the device characteristics of IGZO transistors, such as negative bias illumination stability (NBIS),were understood to be related to these deep states.

CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with $Pnma$ space group, featuring chains of edge-shared CoO$_6$ octahedra arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Two antiferromagnetic transitions are observed at $T$$_{N1}$ = 14.4 K and $T$$_{N2}$ = 16.2 K, corresponding to two long-range magnetic orders with propagation vectors of $\bf{k}$$_1$ = (0, 0, 0) and $\bf{k}$$_2$ = (0.125, 0, 0.25), respectively. The ground state is determined as a canted up-up-down-down zigzag spin configuration along the $c$ axis, wherein the magnetic moments of Co1 and Co2 ions are 3.4(1) and 2.1(1)$\mu$$_B$, respectively. Successive spin-flop transitions appear with the increasing magnetic field applied along the easy axis ($c$ axis), accompanied by depression of the antiferromagnetic orders and enhancement of residual magnetic entropy. The field-induced spin-disordered state suggests that CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ may be an ideal candidate for studying frustrated magnetism.</p>

            <p>Theoretically, the relative change of the Heisenberg-type nearest-neighbor coupling $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor coupling $J_2$ in the face-centered-cubic lattice can give rise to three main antiferromagnetic orderings of type-I, type-II, and type-III. However, it is difficult to tune the $J_2/J_1$ ratio in real materials. Here, we report studies on the influence of Te$^{6+}$ and W$^{6+}$ ions replacement to the magnetic interactions and the magnetic ground states in the double-perovskite compounds Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co). For Ba$_2$MnTe$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$, the W$^{6+}$ doping on Te$^{6+}$ site is successful in $0.02 \leq x \leq 0.9$ with short-range orders of the type-I ($0.02 \leq x \leq 0.08$) and type-II ($0.1 \leq x \leq 0.9$). In Ba$_2$CoTe$_{1-x}$W${_x}$O$_6$, x-ray diffraction measurements reveal two crystal structures, including the trigonal phase ($0 \leq x \leq 0.1$) and the cubic phase ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1$), between which is a miscibility gap. Two magnetic transitions are identified in the trigonal phase due to two magnetic subsystems, and the type-II magnetic order is observed in the cubic phase. Magnetic phase diagrams of Ba$_2M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co) are established. Our work shows that the magnetic interactions and ground states of Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$ can be tuned effectively by the replacement of Te$^{6+}$ by W$^{6+}$ ions.</p>

This suggests that below the CDW transition temperature, the correlation between localized spins may develop at both ${\bf q}_m$ and ${\bf q}_m\pm {\bf Q}_c$.

In this work, we consider finite-time feedback processes in classical discrete systems described by Markov jump processes, and derive achievable bounds on entropy production for feedback processes controlled by Maxwell's demons. The key ingredients of our approach is optimal transport theory and an achievable Fano's inequality, by which we optimize the Wasserstein distance over final distributions under fixed consumed information. Our study reveals the minimum entropy production for consuming a certain amount of information, and moreover, the optimal feedback protocol to achieve it. These results are expected to lead to design principles for information processing in various stochastic systems with discrete states.</p>

            <h2>Edge dependence of the Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seong Jang, Geon-Hyoung Park, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Gil-Ho Lee</p>
            <p>The observation of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime has attracted considerable attention, revealing the coexistence of two seemingly incompatible phases: the quantum Hall and superconducting states. However, the mechanism underlying the Josephson current remains unclear because of the observed h/2e magnetic interference period and the lack of precisely quantized Hall plateaus. To address this issue, we investigate the edge dependence of the Josephson current in graphene Josephson junctions operating in the quantum Hall regime. By systematically comparing devices with native, etched, edge-free, and gate-defined edges, we demonstrate that the Josephson current is confined to the physical edges and is highly sensitive to specific edge configurations. Our findings provide direct evidence that counter-propagating quantum Hall edge states mediate Andreev bound states, enabling Josephson coupling. These results clarify the underlying mechanism of Josephson current in the quantum Hall regime and offer new strategies for engineering superconducting hybrid devices.</p>

            <h2>Extended Fractional Chern Insulators Near Half Flux in Twisted Bilayer Graphene Above the Magic Angle</h2>

            <p>Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) -- the lattice analog of the fractional quantum Hall states -- form as fractionalized quasiparticles emerge in a partially-filled Chern band. This fractionalization is driven by an interplay of electronic interaction and quantum geometry of the underlying wavefunctions. Bilayer graphene with an interlayer twist near the magic angle of 1.1° hosts diverse correlated electronic states at zero magnetic field. When the twist angle exceeds 1.3°, the electronic bandwidth is sufficient to suppress the zero-field correlated states. Yet applying a magnetic field can restore the importance of electron-electron interactions. Here, we report strongly-correlated phases when a 1.37° twisted bilayer graphene sample is tuned to near half a magnetic flux quantum per moiré cell, deep into the Hofstadter regime. Most notably, well-quantized odd-denominator FCI states appear in multiple Hofstadter subbands, over unusually large ranges of density. This suggests a mechanism beyond disorder is stabilizing the fractional states. We also observe a bending and resetting of the Landau minifan reminiscent of the cascade of Dirac resets observed in magic-angle samples near integer filling at zero field.</p>

            <p>Metamaterials are a promising platform for a range of applications, from shock absorption to mechanical computing. These functionalities typically rely on floppy modes or mechanically frustrated loops, both of which are difficult to design. Here, we introduce a combinatorial approach that allows to create an arbitrarily large number of floppy modes and frustrated loops. The design freedom of the mode shapes enables us to easily introduce kinematic incompatibility to turn them into frustrated loops. We demonstrate that floppy modes can be sequentially buckled by using a specific instance of elastoplastic buckling, and we utilize the designability of floppy chains and frustrated loops to demonstrate matrix-vector multiplication in materia.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rintaro Masaoka, Seishiro Ono, Hoi Chun Po, Haruki Watanabe</p>
            <p>Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</p>

            <p>PrAlSi, a non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal candidate with a Curie temperature of 17.8K, offers a unique platform for exploring the interplay of symmetry breaking and topological electronic structures. Up to now, the Weyl fermion distribution as well as their evolution across the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition in PrAlSi has not been explored. Here, we uncover the presence of Weyl fermions in PrAlSi and demonstrate they could be manipulated through the magnetic phase transition. Our ab-initio calculations indicate a shift in the momentum and energy positions of Weyl fermions, alongside an increase in Weyl point numbers due to band splitting. The predicted band splitting and shifting of Weyl fermions are corroborated by our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments. Such manipulation of Weyl fermions leads to the appearance of a net chirality charge and a significant modulation in optical conductivity, as proposed by our calculations. Our research presents a novel method for adjusting the properties of Weyl semimetals by controlling Weyl fermions through magnetic phase transitions, positioning PrAlSi as a model system.</p>

            <p>Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) with both localized moments and itinerant conduction bands are not only important for fundamental research but also have significant technological applications. In particular, Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ is a prototypical high-temperture REPM, where the Co atoms form a kagome-honeycomb stacked lattice. Here we report synthesis of epitaxial Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy and measurements of their momentum-resolved electronic structure from \textit{in-situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results unveil two flat bands from Co $3d$ orbitals near the Fermi level ($E_F$), one at $\sim$-300meV and another right at $E_F$, which arise from orbital-selective destructive interference and strong electron correlations, respectively. In addition, our results reveal that Sm $4f$ states are far away from $E_F$ (hence mostly localized) and exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, caused by the $3d$-$4f$ magnetic coupling. Our findings provide direct spectroscopic insights to understand the strong uniaxial ferromagnetism in Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ (and REPMs alike). Our work also opens avenues to explore flat-band physics near $E_F$ and emergent phenomena in correlated kagome-honeycomb lattices.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent studies of the cluster Mott insulator candidate compound Nb3Cl8, this study performs 93Nb and 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to investigate the electron correlations. Below the structural transition temperature Ts ~ 97 K, all satellites of the 93Nb NMR spectra split into three distinct peaks, which suggests symmetry lowering due to the structural transition and could be attributed to the change in the Nb-Nb bond-lengths of the Nb3 clusters. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 divided by the temperature T, 1/T1T, increases upon cooling to Ts for all Cl sites, whereas only the Knight shift K of Cl located at the center of the Nb3 clusters exhibits a temperature dependence similar to that observed in magnetic susceptibility. These findings collectively demonstrate the existence of strong spin correlations between the Nb atoms in Nb3Cl8, which are closely associated with Mottness.</p>

            <h2>Chiral magnon splitting in altermagnetic CrSb from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Fan Zhang, Xiao-Sheng Ni, Ke Chen, Kun Cao</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism has been proposed as a new type of magnetism, simultaneously exhibiting compensated spin moments in real space and spin-split electronic bands in reciprocal space. Alternating chiral magnon splitting is considered a unique feature of altermagnets. In this work, utilizing linear spin wave theory (LSWT), which is based on a localized spin picture and itinerant time-dependent density functional perturbation theory (TD-DFPT), we investigate the spin fluctuation spectra of altermagnetic CrSb. Along the L-$\Gamma$-L$^{\prime}$ path, the LSWT provides a chiral magnon splitting of up to 9 meV, located at high excitation energies around 140 meV, which is identified to be primarily driven by the splitting of two long-range exchange interactions, with exchange paths along the body diagonal lines of the unit cell. On the other hand, the more realistic TD-DFPT obtains more significant splitting of $\sim$ 30 meV at maximum. However, the splitting is severely smeared out due to strong Landau damping from the Stoner continuum, which may make it difficult to observe experimentally, e.g. through inelastic neutron scattering. We further provide a brief discussion on the connection between the Stoner excitations and the chiral magnon splitting.</p>

            <h2>Unified mechanism of charge-density-wave and high-$T_c$ superconductivity protected from oxygen vacancies in bilayer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daisuke Inoue, Youichi Yamakawa, Seiichiro Onari, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Unconventional charge and spin density-wave states are commonly observed in bilayer nickelates, drawing considerable attention due to their proximity to high-$T_c$ superconductivity in various phase diagrams. However, the nature and mechanisms of charge and spin density-waves (DWs) in nickelates remain poorly understood. Numerous experiments have reported that the charge-density-wave (CDW) transition temperature $T_{ cdw}$ and the spin-density-wave (SDW) transition temperature $T_{sdw}$ are closely related but distinct. However, in contrast to these experiments, previous mean-field-type analyses have yielded only a simple SDW phase. To resolve this key problem, this paper demonstrates that sizable CDW instabilities emerge in proportion to the SDW instability in La$3$Ni$2$O$7$.This behavior is driven by the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism, which captures important electron correlations beyond mean-field theory. Therefore, (i) experimental CDW + SDW coexisting state is naturally explained. In addition, (ii) the CDW + SDW fluctuations cooperatively drive high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Notably, the predicted $s$-wave SC state is robust against the inner apical O vacancies. Furthermore, (iii) the CDW instability is highly sensitive to the size of the $d_{z^2}$-orbital hole pocket, allowing for the realization of CDW quantum criticality through carrier-doping and pressure application. We find that the coexistence of charge and spin fluctuations is essential in bilayer nickelates, with both playing a cooperative role in mediating high-$T_c$ superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Tunable topological protection in Rydberg lattices via a novel quantum Monte Carlo approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pranay Patil, Owen Benton</p>
            <p>Rydberg atom arrays have recently been conjectured to host $Z_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in certain parameter regimes. Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</p>

            <h2>Echo state property and memory capacity of artificial spin ice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomohiro Taniguchi</p>
            <p>Physical reservoir computing by using artificial spin ice (ASI) has been proposed on the basis of both numerical and experimental analyses. ASI is a many-body system consisting of ferromagnets with various interactions. Recently, fabricating magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as ferromagnets in an ASI was achieved in the experiment, which enables an electrical detection of magnetic state of each MTJ independently. However, performing a recognition task of time-dependent signal by such an MTJ-based ASI has not been reported yet. In this work, we examine numerical simulation of a recognition task of time-dependent input and evaluate short-term memory and parity-check capacities. These capacities change significantly when the magnitude of the input magnetic field is comparable to a value around which the magnetization alignment is greatly affected by the dipole interaction. It implies that the presence of the dipole interaction results in a loss of echo state property. This point was clarified by evaluating Lyapunov exponent and confirming that the drastic change of the memory capacities appears near the boundary between negative and zero exponents, which corresponds to the edge of echo state property.</p>

            <p>The Lebwohl-Lasher model of liquid crystals with (d = 2, n = 3) describes interacting apolar spins, with an $RP^{2}$ order-parameter topology. Simulations with a modified Wang-Landau Monte Carlo protocol, that includes a density of states (DoS) factor, had previously found a zero latent-heat transition at $T=T_{n}$ to a novel nematic order, coexisting with unbound defects whose binding is completed only on cooling. We find through this entropically augmented MC protocol, that there is a deep dip in the DoS at an energy preceding global ordering, reflecting 'sparse' intermediate configurations, or entropy barriers. The narrow entropic bottleneck induces a cusp in the initially rising nematic correlation length, at a micro-canonical 'precursor' temperature $T=T_{p}$. A finite-scale cooperativity of defects and nematic clusters penetrates the bottleneck at $T_{p}$ to enable a third-order phase transition at a lower $T_{n}$: a rare pathway, overlooked by energy-only acceptance protocols.</p>

            <p>Interfacing complex oxides in atomically engineered layered structures can give rise to a wealth of exceptional electronic and magnetic properties that surpass those of the individual building blocks. Herein, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic spin order with a high Curie temperature of 608 K in superlattices consisting of otherwise paramagnetic perovskite LaNiO3 (LNO) and antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 (LFO). The extraordinary ferromagnetism likely results from the covalent exchange due to interfacial charge transfer from Fe to Ni cations. By deliberately controlling the thickness of the LNO sublayers thus the amount of charge transfer, a robust ferromagnetism of 4 uB is realized for a stacking periodicity consisting of one single unit cell of both LNO and LFO, an emergent double perovskite phase of La2FeNiO6 with B-site layered ordering configurations. The ferromagnetic LFO/LNO superlattices offer great potential for the search of emergent magnetodielectric and/or multiferroic properties as well as applications in spintronics and electrocatalysts.</p>

            <p>Accurately determining the coupling strength between polaron states is essential to describe charge-hopping transport in materials. In this work, we revisit methodologies to extract coupling strengths using ab initio approaches. Our findings underscore the critical role of incorporating anharmonic effects in the model Hamiltonian when analyzing total energy variations along reaction coordinates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling strength extraction based on total energy calculated from ab initio approaches is fundamentally limited due to the stabilization of diabatic states, which do not involve coupling strength. We demonstrate that such limitation exists in both DFT+U and HSE hybrid functionals, which are widely used in the study of polaron transport. Instead, we suggest extracting coupling strength directly from the electronic structure of a system in neutral conditions. The neutral condition avoids overestimating coupling strength due to additional energy splitting between bonding and anti-bonding states from the charging energy. This study highlights the limitations of existing methods and introduces a robust framework for accurately extracting coupling parameters, paving the way for improved modeling of charge transport in complex materials.</p>

            <p>Modern electromechanical actuators and sensors rely on the piezoelectric effect that linearly couples strain and electric polarization. However, this effect is restricted to materials that lack inversion symmetry. In contrast, the flexoelectric effect couples strain gradients to electric polarization, and is a universal property in insulating materials of arbitrary symmetry. Flexoelectricity becomes prominent at the nanoscale from the inverse scaling of strain gradients with material dimensions. Here, we measure the strain-gradient-induced structural distortions in strontium titanate using multislice electron ptychography. This technique enables reliable picometer-scale measurements of the dominant oxygen-titanium distortions, correcting for artifacts that limited conventional imaging methods. This enables us to directly measure the sign of the net ionic contribution to the flexoelectric polarization. Guided by the experimental measurements, first-principles calculations show how the sign and magnitude of the bulk contribution to the flexoelectric coefficient in strontium titanate can be switched by tuning the strain state. Hybridization between the optical soft phonon and acoustic phonon modes drives this transition, yielding a large response and a polarity switch across the resonance. This strain-dependence might explain the sign discrepancy and orders of magnitude variation in the values of previously reported flexoelectric coefficients for strontium titanate. As the strain state of curved membranes can be tuned, our approach also suggests an approach to engineer nanoscale flexoelectric polarization using strain as a control parameter.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic conductors with suitably broken spatial symmetries host spin-polarized bands, which lead to transport phenomena commonly observed in metallic ferromagnets. In bulk materials, it is the given crystalline structure that determines whether symmetries are broken and spin-polarized bands are present. Here we demonstrate experimentally that double-gate transistors realized on bilayers of van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS4 allow the relevant symmetry to be controlled by a perpendicular electric displacement field. Such a level of control enables the spin-polarization of the conduction band to be switched on and off. Because conduction band states with opposite spin-polarizations are hosted in the different layers and are spatially separated, these devices also give control over the magnetization of the electrons that are accumulated electrostatically. Our experiments show that double-gated CrPS4 transistors provide a viable platform to create gate-induced conductors with near unity spin polarization at the Fermi level, as well as devices with a full electrostatic control of the total magnetization of the system.</p>

            <p>Probabilistic computing with pbits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled pbits, and the energy minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.</p>

            <p>The mechanical exfoliation of two-dimensional materials has sparked significant interest in the study of low-dimensional structures. In this work, we investigate the bulk and low-dimensional derivatives of BiSeI, a quasi-one-dimensional anisotropic crystal known for its remarkable stability and novel electronic properties. Using the density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, we examine the influence of dimensionality on their electronic, optical, and excitonic properties. Quasi-particle $\mathit{G_0W_0}$ calculations reveal a significant increase in the band gap with a decrease in dimensionality, driven by quantum confinement effects and reduced dielectric screening. By solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we identify a transition from weakly bound Wannier-Mott excitons in bulk BiSeI to strongly bound excitons its low-dimensional forms. These structures feature band gaps spanning the infrared to the visible spectrum and exhibit large exciton binding energies, making them promising for next-generation optoelectronics and excitonic applications. Our findings provide a theoretical foundation for future experimental studies on BiSeI and its low-dimensional counterparts.</p>

However, the low energy density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric, which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds (Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm$^3$ with high efficiency nearly 100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance dielectrics.</p>

            <h2>From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring novel phases in transverse field Ising chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davood Marripour, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>Time crystals (TCs) and time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent novel phases of matter that arise from the breaking of time translational symmetry in periodically and quasiperiodically driven quantum systems. In this study, we explore the formation of a TQC phase within the disordered quantum Ising chain model under a transverse field (ITF). Notably, TQCs demonstrate robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies, unlike traditional TCs which respond at a single frequency. Our analysis reveals that the TQC phase exhibits stable magnetization responses even in the presence of interaction perturbations and imperfections in the quasiperiodic driving fields. Employing exact diagonalization techniques, we find that increasing the chain length further stabilizes both TC and TQC phases. These results suggest promising pathways for experimental realization of TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, opening avenues for deeper investigation into these intriguing dynamical phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Engineering tunable fractional Shapiro steps in colloidal transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andris P. Stikuts, Seemant Mishra, Artem Ryabov, Philipp Maass, Pietro Tierno</p>
            <p>Shapiro steps are quantized plateaus in the velocity-force or velocity-torque curve of a driven system, when its speed remains constant despite an increase in the driving force. For microscopic particles driven across a sinusoidal potential, integer Shapiro steps have been observed. By driving a single colloidal particle across a time-modulated, non-sinusoidal periodic optical landscape, we here demonstrate that fractional Shapiro steps emerge in addition to integer ones. Measuring the particle position via individual particle tracking, we reveal the underlying microscopic mechanisms that produce integer and fractional steps and demonstrate how these steps can be controlled by tuning the shape and driving protocol of the optical potential. The flexibility offered by optical engineering allows us to generate wide ranges of potential shapes and to study, at the single-particle level, synchronization behavior in driven soft condensed matter systems.</p>

            <h2>Deep Neural Network-Based Voltage Prediction for Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials</h2>

            <p>Accurately predicting the voltage of battery materials is essential for advancing energy storage technologies and designing more efficient, high-performance batteries. In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the average voltage of materials used in Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from the Materials Project, incorporating a diverse set of features, including structural, physical, chemical, electronic, and thermodynamic properties, along with battery-specific descriptors. These features were utilized to construct a robust DNN model aimed at facilitating the discovery of novel battery materials. The model performance evaluated through 10-fold cross validation achieving an R$^2$ value of 0.99 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.069 V on the validation dataset. This high level of accuracy underscores the model's capability to capture the complex relationship between material properties and electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that machine learning approaches, particularly DNN models, can provide rapid and reliable voltage predictions without relying on computationally expensive first-principles calculations. This research shows how systematic data analysis can accelerate the identification and improvement of next-generation battery materials. By focusing on key material properties and using computational methods, our study lays the groundwork for faster development of new energy storage solutions.</p>

            <p>We present an algorithm that integrates pseudosymmetry search with first-principles calculations to systematically identify achiral parent structures and establish potential chiral displacive transitions linking them to their corresponding chiral phases within the 22 enantiomorphic space groups. This approach enables a robust exploration of structural relationships, offering new insights into symmetry-driven properties. Our workflow streamlines the discovery of displacive chiral phase transitions driven by soft phonon modes, providing insights into the mechanisms of structural chirality in inorganic materials. We apply this methodology on the chiral phases of TeO$_2$, Na$_2$SeO$_9$, Sr$_2$As$_2$O$_7$, As$_2$O$_5$, Rb$_2$Be$_2$O$_3$, and CaTe$_2$O$_3$. Demonstrating that some do not have a minimal supergroup that allows for an achiral phase; some can have a minimal supergroup, still, no unstable phonon mode exists in the achiral phase; and somewhere the minimal supergroup exists with a soft phonon mode connecting the identified achiral phase and the chiral phase through small continuous displacements.</p>

            <h2>Drivers of chemical diffusion of hydrogen in the thin transition metallic glass V80Zr20</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lennart Spode, Ola Hartmann, Gunnar Karl Pálsson</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the feasibility of using optical transmission to determine concentration-dependent hydrogen diffusion coefficients and activation energies of thin metallic glass films over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations. The hydrogen concentration's temporal and spatial profiles are simultaneously extracted without requiring a metal-insulator transition or hydride formation. The concentration-dependent activation energy is extracted and is found to exhibit similar concentration dependence as hydrogen in the disordered bulk alpha-phase of vanadium. The activation energy is in stark contrast, however, to the activation energy found in epitaxial vanadium films of similar thickness. The chemical diffusion increases with hydrogen concentration in the glass, whereas it decreases in the crystalline case owing to the differences in the thermodynamic factors. This technique provides detailed insight into the concentration dependence of hydrogen diffusion and constrains theories treating correlated motion of hydrogen and short-range hydrogen-hydrogen interaction. The method can be applied to other materials that show an optical response to hydrogen uptake.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-jie Shi, Yao-hui Zhu</p>
            <p>Targeting the key issue of the microscopic mechanism for high-T$_c$ superconductivity in cuprates and nickelates and following the principle of "exploring the pairing mechanism of electrons by tracing their migration and gathering", we propose a new idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the local e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) picture, based on the strong ionic bonding and the strong attraction of the oxygen nuclei to electrons, which clarifies numerous experimental puzzles. The Cooper-pair wavefunction and its typical characteristics are given. It is this universal picture, confirmed through diverse experimental evidence, most notably the STM tunneling constant-current image on the CuO$_2$ plane combining with the ultra-small Cooper-pair size as an ironclad proof, that determines the unconventional high-T$_c$ superconductivity of oxide superconductors. According to our e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) picture, the room-temperature electron (hole) pairing can be realized in ionic oxides, laying a key foundation for achieving the room-temperature superconductivity, and bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductors one step closer.</p>

            <p>Loss spectroscopy is a key tool for investigating systems where important system parameters are linked to intrinsic resonant loss processes. We investigate three-body loss processes of impurity atoms embedded in a medium of a Bose-Einstein Condensate close to a Feshbach resonance. In this case, the loss processes occur faster than the measurement duration, impeding a direct time-resolved measurement. Here, we discuss how an even faster two-body loss process can be used to probe the system. The time-dependent number of atoms in the medium is reconstructed from such measurements, allowing for a measurement of the three-body loss rate coefficient $L_3$ and its scaling with scattering length. Moreover, the medium atom number is reconstructed from spectroscopic loss measurements. This allows for a comparison of the medium densities based on both the extracted loss rates and the spectroscopically reconstructed atom number. Finally, the number of lost medium atoms per loss event is evaluated and found to exceed 2 at strong interactions, which is attributed to secondary collisions in the medium. These investigations establish the use of a fast loss mechanism as a new tool in the field and provide quantitative measurements of three-body losses at large interaction strengths.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, providing a rich platform for exploring the physical properties of multiferroic materials. Here, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers ($\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}$) are two-dimensional ferroelectric altermagnets, as confirmed by symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations. $\mathrm{VOI_2}$ monolayer exhibits a strong magnetoelectric coupling coefficient ($\alpha_S \approx 1.208 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{s/m}$), with spin splitting in the electronic band structure tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. Additionally, the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric crystals enables significant nonlinear optical effects, such as shift current (SC). The x-direction component of SC component is observed to have an ferroicity-driven switch. Moreover, the $\sigma^{yyy}$ component exhibits an exceptionally large spin SC of $330.072~\mathrm{\mu A/V^2}$. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity, offering versatile tunability of electronic and optical properties. $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers provide a promising platform for advancing two-dimensional multiferroics, paving the way for energy-efficient memory devices, nonlinear optical applications and opto-spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Gate electrode-induced nonreciprocal resistance in topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sofie Kölling, Florian R. Westerhof, Alexander Brinkman</p>
            <p>A common method of controlling the chemical potential in topological insulators is applying a gate electrode. Simultaneously applying high source-drain bias currents can lead to parasitic effects in such devices. We derive that these parasitic effects lead to a gradient in the Hall effect along the current lead of a Hall bar. Consequently, nonreciprocal effects in both longitudinal and Hall voltages appear upon reversing the bias. These effects scale similarly to the magnetochiral anisotropy, requiring detailed analysis to make a distinction. Experimentally we show that nonreciprocal effects can appear in materials where magnetochiral anisotropy is not expected while a top gate is present. Without gate electrode, this nonreciprocal effect is found to be absent. These results show the importance of considering and, if possible, excluding gate electrode-induced effects when searching for nonreciprocal resistance intrinsic to a material.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Disorder on the Energy Landscape and Motional Mechanisms Involved in Lithium Ion Dynamics and Transport in Solid Electrolytes: Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 Argyrodite as a Case Study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ali Badragheh, Vanessa Miß, Bernhard Roling, Michael Vogel</p>
            <p>7Li NMR diffusometry and relaxometry are combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to compare the mechanisms for the dynamics and transport of lithium ions in disordered and crystalline electrolytes with argyrodite composition Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5. The dc conductivity of a disordered sample prepared by ball milling amounts to 0.76 mScm-1 at room temperature, which is substantially lower than that of two previously studied crystalline argyrodites differing in the order of the anion sublattice due to various heat treatments. However, the activation energy of the dc conductivity is smaller for ball-milled disordered Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (E_dc= 0.35 eV) than for both crystalline compounds (E_dc= 0.38 eV). 7Li NMR field-gradient measurements of the self-diffusion coefficient D and its activation energy E_D confirm these findings and, furthermore, reveal different Haven ratios. 7Li NMR field-cycling relaxometry shows that the lithium ion jumps in ball-milled Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 are described by very broad dynamical susceptibilities arising from a temperature-independent Gaussian-like distribution of activation energies g(E_a) with a mean value of E_m= 0.43 eV, while the susceptibilities indicated a high-energy cutoff for the crystalline electrolytes. Based on different relations between the activation energies for the conductivity, diffusivity and jumps, we discuss that the shape and exploration of the energy landscapes of ball-milled and crystalline Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 samples strongly differ. Moreover, significant differences in the preexponential factor of the dc conductivity, the Haven ratio and the single-particle correlation factor point to distinct types of anion lattice disorder of the ball-milled disordered and heat-treated crystalline samples.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortex. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe$_2$ have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe$_2$ with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction of UTe$_2$ (crystallographic a axis). Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the depth of the superconducting gap and the coherence peak on the one side of the vortex core are stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Considering the distribution of the magnetic field in the vortex, this symmetry breaking is due to the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe$_2$ and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic fields.</p>

We provide realistic parameters for observing the negative currents in an experiment and show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Cameron, Elsen Tjhung</p>
            <p>We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer high efficiency and low costs, making them key for future photovoltaics. Optimizing charge transport layers is crucial, with porous TiO$_2$ widely used as electron transport layers (ETL) due to its energy alignment, transparency, and abundance. However, its efficiency relies on crystallinity requiring high-temperature processing (>450$^\circ$C), increasing costs and limiting flexible substrates. Low-temperature wet-chemical methods face scalability issues due to material waste and hazardous solvents. In this context, plasma-based technologies are emerging as a more efficient and sustainable alternative to oxide-based ETLs. This study presents the synthesis of TiO$_2$ layers using an advanced plasma method combining remote plasma-assisted vacuum deposition (RPAVD) and soft plasma etching (SPE) at mild temperatures (<200$^\circ$C), allowing control of microstructure and porosity. The resulting nanocolumnar film, decorated with a highly porous aerogel-like layer, enhances optical and electronic properties. These plasma-synthesized TiO$_2$ layers are antireflective and improve the efficiency in porous n-i-p PSCs, matching the performance of high-temperature reference cells. These PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 14.6%, a high value compared to reference devices synthesized at 450°C. Impedance spectroscopy confirms high recombination resistance and stable capacitance, linked to improved perovskite crystallinity. Our results highlight the potential of the RPAVD+SPE approach for producing low-temperature efficient ETLs, providing a feasible, industrially scalable, and eco-friendly alternative for manufacturing flexible, high-performance photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuechen Wang, Yaxin Gao, Menghao Wu</p>
            <p>The ion conductivity of a solid-state ion conductor generally increases exponentially upon reduction in ion migration barrier. For prevalent cathode material LiCoO2, the room-temperature ion conductivity and migration barrier are respectively around 10-4 S/cm and 0.3 eV. In this paper, through first-principles calculations we predict the existence of 1D superionicity as the Li ions in O2 LiCoO2 are transformed to Zn0.5CoO2 or Li0.5CoO2 via cation-exchange reaction or deintercalation. The ion migration barriers (0.01-0.02 eV) even lower than room-temperature ~kBT are reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with LiCoO2, which are facilitated by facile transition of mobile ions between two coordination configurations. The room-temperature ion conductivity is estimated to be over 50 S/cm, enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared with current highest reported value. Such unprecedented superionicity may also exist in other similar layered ion conductors, which may render technical advances and exotic effects such as ultrafast ion batteries and quantized ferroelectricity.</p>

            <p>Magnetoelectric composites integrate the coupling between magnetic and piezoelectric materials to create new functionalities for potential technological applications. This coupling is typically achieved through the exchange of magnetic, electric, or elastic energy across the interfaces between the different constituent materials. Tailoring the strength of the magnetoelectric effect is primarily accomplished by selecting suitable materials for each constituent and by optimizing geometrical and microstructural designs. Various composite architectures, such as (0-3), (2-2), (1-3) and core-shell connectivities, have been studied to enhance magnetoelectric coupling and other required physical properties in composites. This review examines the latest advancements in magnetoelectric materials, focusing on the impact of different interphase connectivity types on their properties and performance. Before exploring magnetic-electric coupling, a brief overview of the historical background of multiferroic magnetoelectric composites is provided. Fundamental concepts underlying the magnetoelectric effect, piezoelectricity, and the magnetostrictive effect are explained, including their origins and examples of these materials' properties. So far, three types of magnetoelectric composite connectivities have been investigated experimentally: particulate composites (0-3), laminated and thin films (2-2), sticks embedded in matrix, core-shell particles, and coaxial fibers.

            <p>Two-dimensional moire materials present unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum phases of matter arising from the interplay of band topology and strong this http URL of the most striking examples is the recent observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe2) with relatively large twist angles(~3.7deg-3.9deg). The electronic ground states are usually expected to be sensitive to the twist angle, as the twist angle determines the electron bandwidth and correlation strength in the moire system. Here, we report the observation of unexpected competing magnetic ground states in tMoTe2 moire superlattice, on which balance can be tipped by both twist angle and electric field (E). Specifically, we observed anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states with zero Hall resistance at both v_h=1 and 2/3, at intermediate twist angles ~3deg. The AFM orders are suppressed by applying vertical E, and emergent charge-transfer ferromagnetism accompanied by integer Chern insulator (ICI) or fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states are observed near the critical E (E_c) of moire superlattice symmetry transition. Our results demonstrate tMoTe2 as a fascinating platform for exploring unexpected correlated phases with nontrivial topology and fractional excitations and point to electric-field-controlled ultralow-power spin-valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Transition metal molybdenum oxides A2Mo3O8 (A= Mn, Fe, Co) are known to be polar magnets where A ions are located in either octahedrally or tetrahedrally coordinated sites. In this paper we predict that their polarizations can be reversed via swapping of two coordinations for A ions, giving rise to robust vertical ferroelectricity. Such unique ferroelectricity via coordination swapping can be used to control the Neel vector in altermagnetic Fe2Mo3O8, while the large non-relativistic spin-splittings can be also altered by ferroelectric switching in Luttinger compensated magnetic Mn2Mo3O8, both in the absence of net magnetization. However, their ultra-thin layers may possess net magnetizations that can be reversed upon ferroelectric switching. Our findings provide a new type of multiferroicity as well as a new avenue in control of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</p>

            <p>We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of \textit{ab initio} electronic structure theory -- namely a concentration wave analysis -- and atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this technologically relevant class of materials.</p>

In the present work, we provide general rules for obtaining nonzero Hopf term in spin systems when coupling to Dirac fermions. This method allows to direct dectation of the coefficient of the Hopf term without detailed calculations from path integral. We apply this framework to several models and verify that our results are self-consistent. Especially, we design a simple two-cone model on the checkerboard lattice and demonstrate how it realizes the Hopf term according to the above rules.</p>

            <p>Materials in the family $R$V$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ ($R=$ rare earth) provide a unique platform to investigate the interplay between local moments from $R$ layers and nonmagnetic vanadium kagome layers. Yet, the investigation of actinide members remains scarce. Here we report the synthesis of UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ single crystals through the self-flux technique. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal expansion measurements reveal two uranium-driven antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1}=29$~K and $T_{N2}=24$~K, a complex field-temperature phase diagram, and unusual negative domain wall magnetoresistance. Specific heat measurements unveil a modest Sommerfeld coefficient of $\gamma = 40$~mJ/mol.K$^{2}$, consistent with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements that show a moderate $f$-electron enhancement at the Fermi level ($E_{F}$). Our experiments support a modest contribution from \textit{5f} flat bands to the density of states at $E_{F}$, whereas our band structure calculations place the vanadium flat bands 0.25~eV above $E_{F}$. Our findings point to a materials opportunity to expand the uranium 166 family with the goal of enhancing correlations by tuning $5f$ and $3d$ flat bands to $E_{F}$.</p>

            <h2>Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huan Jiang, Shao-Kai Jian</p>
            <p>We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use mean-field theory to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</p>

            <h2>Coherent microwave comb generation via the Josephson effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Angelo Greco, Xavier Ballu, Francesco Giazotto, Alessandro Crippa</p>
            <p>Frequency combs represent exceptionally precise measurement tools due to the coherence of their spectral lines. While optical frequency comb sources constitute a well-established technology, superconducting circuits provide a relatively unexplored on-chip platform for low-dissipation comb emitters able to span from gigahertz to terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate coherent microwave frequency comb generation by leveraging the ac Josephson effect in a superconducting quantum interference device. A time-dependent magnetic drive periodically generates voltage pulses, which in the frequency domain correspond to a comb with dozens of spectral modes. The micrometer-scale footprint and minimal dissipation inherent to superconducting systems foster the integration of our comb generator with advanced cryogenic electronics. Transferring optical techniques to the solid-state domain may enable new applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Wettability and sp2/sp3 ratio effects on supercapacitor performance of N-doped hydrogenated amorphous Carbon Nanofoam</h2>

            <p>Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams could be a potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to their properties such as ultralightweight, huge volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that the charge-storage of carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by the wettability, surface area, and porosity of carbon nanostructures. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced around fifty times and the widened voltage of the device increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, although observed in previous literatures but unexplained, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser-deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</p>

            <p>Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</p>

            <h2>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Halati, Ameneh Sheikhan, Giovanna Morigi, Corinna Kollath, Simon B. Jäger</p>
            <p>We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</p>

            <p>Film formation from solvent evaporation in polymer ternary solutions is relevant for several technological applications, such as the fabrication of organic solar cells. The performance of the final device will strongly depend on the internal morphology of the obtained film, which, in turn, is affected by the processing conditions. We are interested in modeling morphology formation in 3D for ternary mixtures using both a lattice model and its continuous counterpart in the absence of evaporation. In our previous works, we found that, in 2D, both models predict the existence of two distinct regimes: (i) a low-solvent regime, characterized by two interpenetrated domains of the two polymers, and (ii) a high-solvent regime, where isolated polymer domains are dispersed in the solvent background. In the significantly more intriguing 3D case, we observe a comparable scenario both for the discrete and the continuous model. The lattice model reveals its ability to describe morphology formation even in the high solvent content 3D case, in which the three-dimensional nature of space could have prevented cluster formation.</p>

            <p>As a fundamental physical phenomenon, achieving and controlling a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is crucial for advancing the understanding of topological physics and for developing applied technologies in spintronics. The recently discovered topological Kagome metal $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A =$ K, Rb, Cs)exhibits a significant AHE along with charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, providing an ideal platform to study the interactions between nontrivial band topology, CDW, and superconductivity. In this study, we systematically investigated the evolution of CDW, superconductivity, and AHE in electron (Mn)-doped Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystals. The experimental results show that electron doping rapidly suppresses superconductivity, while the CDW order remains relatively robust. Meanwhile, a significantly enhanced AHE, with a maximum anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of ~25331 \Ohm ^{-1}\cm^{-1} and an anomalous Hall angle of 6.66% occurs at a relatively low doping level of $x = 0.03$. Based on the Tian-Ye-Jin (TYJ) scaling model, such a significant enhancement AHC is mainly dominated by the skew scattering. We speculated enhanced skew scattering between electrons and Mn originating from the strengthened spin-orbital coupling. Our finding provides important guidance for the design and development of transverse transport properties in topological Kagome materials.</p>

            <h2>Long-range Entanglement and Role of Realistic Interaction in Braiding of Non-Abelian Quasiholes in Fractional Quantum Hall Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ha Quang Trung, Qianhui Xu, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</p>

            <p>Conical microfluidic channels filled with electrolytes exhibit volatile memristive behavior, offering a promising foundation for energy-efficient, neuromorphic computing. Here, we integrate these iontronic channels as additional nonlinear element in nonlinear Shinriki-inspired oscillators and demonstrate that they exhibit alternating chaotic and non-chaotic dynamics across a broad frequency range. Exploiting this behavior, we construct XOR and NAND gates by coupling three "Memriki" oscillators, and we further realize the full set of standard logic gates through combinations of NAND gates. Our results establish a new paradigm for iontronic computing and open avenues for scalable, low-power logical operations in microfluidic and bio-inspired systems.</p>

            <p>Chaotic behavior or lack thereof in non-Hermitian systems is often diagnosed via spectral analysis of associated complex eigenvalues. Very recently, singular values of the associated non-Hermitian systems have been proposed as an effective measure to study dissipative quantum chaos. Motivated by the rich properties of non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices and its promise as a platform to study localized and delocalized phases in non-Hermitian systems, we make an in-depth study to assess different spectral phases of these matrices through the lens of both complex eigenvalues and singular values. Remarkably, the results from complex spectra and singular value analysis are seemingly different, thereby necessitating caution while identifying different phases. We also exemplify our findings by studying a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with a complex on-site disorder. Our work indicates that systems, where disorder is present both in the Hermitian and non-Hermitian segments of a Hamiltonian, are sensitive to the specific diagnostic tool that needs to be employed to study quantum chaos.</p>

In altermagnetic materials, as an alternative, it can also be protected by crystal symmetry, which can be referred to as the quantum crystal spin Hall effect.</p>

            <p>Marrying the predictive power of ab initio calculations with many-body effects remains a challenging task in two-dimensional (2d) materials, where efficient carrier-carrier interaction challenges established approximation schemes. In particular, understanding exciton-phonon interaction from first principles is a field of growing interest. Here, we present a many-body theory for coupled free-carrier, exciton, phonon and photon dynamics based on carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interaction matrix elements obtained via projection on Wannier orbitals. The framework is applied to study the impact of carrier-phonon correlations on optical spectra and coupled nonequilibrium carrier-phonon kinetics in monolayer MoSe$_2$. We find that non-Markovian effects and dynamical buildup of quasi-particles are only properly described if correlations at least on the two-phonon level are included. Our studies open a perspective to advance the material-realistic description of nonequilibrium physics in 2d nanostructures to new many-body realms.</p>

In this scheme, the top and bottom layers are twisted relative to the middle layer by small angles $\theta$ and 2$\theta$ respectively, generating a kagome-like moiré potential for the middle layer with suitable parameters. The moiré band structures of these systems are calculated within the continuum model and show good resemblance to the breathing kagome band structure, including the flat band, Dirac points with tunable gap, and van Hove singularities. This system serves as a new venue to explore strongly correlated physics on kagome lattices which offers more flexibility and tunability in band structure, charge density, and interaction strength.</p>
