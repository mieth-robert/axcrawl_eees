            <h2>Room-Temperature Superconductivity at 298 K in Ternary La-Sc-H System at High-pressure Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinggang Song, Chuanheng Ma, Hongbo Wang, Mi Zhou, Yanpeng Qi, Weizheng Cao, Shourui Li, Hanyu Liu, Guangtao Liu, Yanming Ma</p>
            <p>Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind. Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1. Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Reply to "Limitations of detecting structural changes and time-reversal symmetry breaking in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments"</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqing Xing, Seokjin Bae, Stephen D. Wilson, Ziqiang Wang, Rafael M. Fernandes, Vidya Madhavan</p>
            <p>In their comment, the authors attribute our observations of light- and magnetic-field-induced manipulation of the CDW state in RbV3Sb5 to random experimental artifacts such as tip changes, drift, and scan conditions, concluding that no intrinsic effect exists. In this reply, we clarify three points. First, our reported magnetic-field-induced CDW switching has been independently replicated in multiple STM studies and corroborated by transport measurements. Second, in our data, the switching of CDW intensities and Bragg vector ratios exhibit high fidelity (nearly 100 $\%$), and this cannot be explained by random artifacts. Lastly, we disprove the comment's unsubstantiated claim about magnetic field values by showing a system-dependent correlation between z-piezo shift and magnetic field. Taken together, our Reply reaffirms the reproducibility and intrinsic nature of light and magnetic field induced CDW manipulation in RbV3Sb5.</p>

            <h2>Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junming Wu, Shihao Zhou, Benedetta Flebus, Wei Zhang</p>
            <p>Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.</p>

            <h2>Stabilization of sliding ferroelectricity through exciton condensation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matteo D'Alessio, Daniele Varsano, Elisa Molinari, Massimo Rontani</p>
            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity is a phenomenon that arises from the insurgence of spontaneous electronic polarization perpendicular to the layers of two-dimensional (2D) systems upon the relative sliding of the atomic layer constituents. Because of the weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, sliding and the associated symmetry breaking can occur at low energy cost in materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides. Here we discuss theoretically the origin and quantitative understanding of the phenomenon by focusing on a prototype structure, the WTe2 bilayer, where sliding ferroelectricity was first experimentally observed. We show that excitonic effects induce relevant energy band renormalizations in the ground state, and exciton condensation contributes significantly to stabilizing ferroelectricity upon sliding beyond previous predictions. Enhanced excitonic effects in 2D and vdW sliding are general phenomena that point to sliding ferroelectricity as relevant for a broad class of important materials, where the intrinsic electric dipole can couple with other quantum phenomena and, in turn, an external electric field can control the quantum phases through ferroelectricity in unexplored ways.</p>

            <h2>Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states with spontaneously broken rotational symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengyu Wang, A. Gupta, S. K. Singh, C. T. Tai, L. N. Pfeiffer, K. W. Baldwin, R. Winkler, M. Shayegan</p>
            <p>The interplay between the fractional quantum Hall effect and nematicity is intriguing as it links emerging topological order and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Anisotropic fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) have indeed been reported in GaAs quantum wells but only in tilted magnetic fields, where the in-plane field explicitly breaks the rotational symmetry. Here we report the observation of FQHSs with highly anisotropic longitudinal resistances in purely perpendicular magnetic fields at even-denominator Landau level (LL) fillings {\nu} = 5/2 and 7/2 in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional hole systems. The coexistence of FQHSs and spontaneous symmetry breaking at half fillings signals the emergence of nematic FQHSs which also likely harbor non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations. By gate tuning the hole density, we observe a phase transition from an anisotropic, developing FQHS to an isotropic composite fermion Fermi sea at {\nu} = 7/2. Our calculations suggest that the mixed orbital components in the partially occupied LL play a key role in the competition and interplay between topological and nematic orders.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic and non-additive interactions of a Rydberg impurity in a quantum bath</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aileen A.T. Durst, Seth T. Rittenhouse, H. R. Sadeghpour, Matthew T. Eiles</p>
            <p>We present a framework for treating anisotropic and non-additive impurity-bath interactions - features that are ubiquitous in realistic quantum impurity problems, but are often neglected in conventional approaches relying on additive, spherically symmetric pseudopotentials. To illustrate this, we focus on a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, where the internal-state degeneracy of the Rydberg impurity gives rise to configuration-dependent non-additive potentials. With increasing interaction strength, anisotropy-induced partial-wave mixing generates distinct polaron and molaron resonances, allowing for radially and angularly excited bound states to become accessible. This approach captures the anisotropy and non-additivity characteristic of a Rydberg impurity immersed in a quantum bath, and provides broad applicability to a host of quantum impurity problems beyond the Fröhlich paradigm.</p>

            <h2>Second ac screening step as a probe for the first-order melting transition in layered vortex matter at intermediate temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gonzalo Rumi, Pablo Pedrazzini, Hernán Pastoriza, Marcin Konczykowski, Yanina Fasano</p>
            <p>We present a new probe for the first-order transition for layered vortex matter: A second step in the screening of an ac field that is independent of the frequency and amplitude of the excitation. This second step is observed in the intermediate temperature and field ranges where detecting the jump in induction associated with the transition is rather elusive with standard magnetometry techniques. We observe this second step following a novel experimental protocol where the screening of a locally-generated ac field is remotely detected in another region of the sample. The coincidence of the typical temperature of the second step in direct and remote measurements strongly supports this feature is a probe of the first-order transition. This nonlocal effect detected at distances of thousands of vortex lattice spacings away indicates that a very efficient mechanism propagates the change in rigidity of the structure from the more (liquid) to the less (solid) symmetric vortex phases.</p>

            <h2>Obstruction-Driven Parity Inversion for Enhanced Optical Absorption in Hexagonal Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungil Baek, Jun Jung, Yong-Hyun Kim</p>
            <p>The optical selection rule states that opposite parity between the valence and conduction bands is required for optical absorption to occur. However, monolayer hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides (h-TMDs) such as $ \mathrm{MoS}_{2} $ exhibit pronounced optical absorption despite their nominally dipole-forbidden d-d transitions. In this Letter, we elucidate a parity inversion mechanism through which obstruction-driven band inversion promotes dipole-allowed optical transitions near the band edge in monolayer h-TMDs. By comparing trivial and obstructed atomic limit phases, we show that intersite interactions between hybridized d orbitals induce parity inversion. Our results provide a novel approach to tuning optical properties through parity control, bridging the gap between topology and light-matter interaction.</p>

            <h2>Quench Dynamics and Stability of Dark Solitons in Exciton Polariton Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chunyu Jia, Zhaoxin Liang</p>
            <p>Exciton polariton condensates (EPCs) have emerged as a paradigmatic platform for investigating nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, particularly due to their intrinsic open-dissipative nature and strong nonlinear interactions governed by the interplay between stimulated scattering and reservoir-mediated damping. Recent advances in Feshbach resonance engineering now enable precise tuning of interaction strengths, opening new avenues to explore exotic nonlinear excitations in these driven-dissipative systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the quench dynamics and stability of dark solitons in repulsive one-dimensional EPCs under sudden parameter variations in both nonlinear interaction strength g and pump intensity P. Through a Hamiltonian variational approach that incorporates reservoir damping effects, we derive reduced equations of motion for soliton velocity evolution that exhibit remarkable qualitative agreement with direct numerical simulations of the underlying open-dissipative Gross Pitaevskii equation. Our results reveal three distinct dynamical regimes: (i) stable soliton propagation at intermediate pump powers, (ii) velocity-dependent soliton breakup above critical pumping thresholds, and (iii) parametric excitation of soliton trains under simultaneous interaction quenches. These findings establish a quantitative framework for understanding soliton dynamics in nonresonantly pumped EPCs, with implications for quantum fluid dynamics and nonequilibrium Bose Einstein condensates.</p>

            <h2>Giant enhancement of terahertz high-harmonic generation by cavity engineering of Dirac semimetal</h2>

            <p>Engineered micro- or nano-structures based on nonlinear optical materials offer versatile opportunities for optoelectronic applications. While extensive efforts have been devoted to design tailored microcavities to promote and increase the optical nonlinearities of graphene, the potential of engineering its three-dimensional counterparts -- three-dimensional Dirac semimetals -- remains largely unexplored. Here we report on exceptionally strong terahertz nonlinearities in a cavity-engineered Dirac semimetal microstructure, and demonstrate a giant enhancement of terahertz third- and fifth-order harmonic yields by more than three orders of magnitude. By fabricating a designed structure of metallic metasurface microcavities on a nanometer thin film of the threedimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, we significantly enhance the near-field intensity of a picosecond terahertz excitation pulse in resonance with the microcavity eigenmode. This transiently modifies the nonlinearities of the thin film and drives the nonlinear responses of the Dirac fermions from a weakly to a deeply nonperturbative regime where the observed high-harmonic generation essentially saturates.</p>

            <h2>Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation in a strongly correlated cobaltite YbBaCo4O7</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Cui, Qiaomei Liu, Qiong Wu, Shuxiang Xu, Junhan Huang, Hao Wang, Rongsheng Li, Shanshan Han, Wei Xu, Li Du, Ming Lu, Chunmei Zhang, Shangfei Wu, Xinbo Wang, Tao Dong, Li Yue, Dong Wu, Nanlin Wang</p>
            <p>We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7. Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60% higher than the initial value, then decays into a metastable state maintaining the enhancement. The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification of multi-electron correlations. In stark contrast to conventional asymmetric systems where SHG is typically suppressed upon photoexcitation, our experimental findings shed a new light on ultrafast optical control nonlinear properties in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Strong-coupling functional renormalization group: Nagaoka ferromagnetism and non-Fermi liquid physics in the Hubbard model at $ U = \infty $</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonas Arnold, Peter Kopietz, Andreas Rückriegel</p>
            <p>We develop an extension of the fermionic functional renormalization group for systems where strong correlations give rise to projected Hilbert spaces. We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.</p>

            <h2>Band Gap Engineering of Nitrogen-Doped Monolayer WSe$_2$ Superlattice and its application to Field Effect Transistor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Cheng Lo, Liao Jia Wang, Yu-Chang Chen</p>
            <p>We systematically investigate the electronic structures of pristine monolayer WSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ superlattices with periodic nitrogen substitution. Unlike random doping, which often introduces in-gap impurity states, periodic nitrogen doping primarily modulates the band gap, thereby facilitating effective band gap engineering for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The gap narrows monotonically with increasing dopant density (pristine $>$ 8-row $>$ 6-row $>$ 4-row), directly influencing device switching. We also evaluate the FET performance of nanojunctions created by these configurations by examining the contour plot of current density as a function of temperature and gate voltage, which quantifies how bandgap engineering affects switching characteristics. Our calculations clarify the classical-quantum crossover in sub-10 nm 2D FETs: as $T$ rises, $J$ approaches the thermionic current; as $T$ falls, quantum tunneling dominates, and the steep energy dependence of $\tau(E)$ may break the classical limit of subthreshold swing imposed by the Boltzmann tyranny. The optimal gating range ($V_g^\mathrm{ON}$, $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$) is investigated for each temperature, insensitive to temperature in the high-temperature regime, confirming the good thermal stability of the FET devices. A comparison study demonstrates that the 4-row structure, with large $J_\mathrm{OFF}$ and restricted operation range, is inappropriate for realistic FET applications. The pristine structure has a high $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ ($\sim$1.1 V) makes it less practical, since such a large threshold voltage may promote time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of the oxide layer, reducing device dependability. The 6-row and 8-row structures exhibit more favorable $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ values ($\sim$0.75 V), achieving compromise, making them more promising candidates for future FET integration.</p>

            <h2>Electrically tunable ultrafast dynamics and interactions of hybrid excitons in a 2D semiconductor bilayer</h2>

            <p>Extended efforts have been devoted to the study of strongly-interacting excitons and their dynamics, towards macroscopic quantum states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates of excitons and polaritons. Momentum-direct layer-hybridized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable attention due to their high oscillator strength and dipolar nature. However, the tunability of their interactions and dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we achieve an unprecedented control over the nonlinear properties of dipolar layer-hybridized excitons in an electrically gated van der Waals homobilayer monitored by transient optical spectroscopy. By applying a vertical electric field, we reveal strong Coulomb interactions of dipolar hybrid excitons, leading to opposite density-dependent energy shifts of the two main hybrid species based on their dipolar orientation, together with a strongly enhanced optical saturation of their absorption. Furthermore, by electrically tuning the interlayer tunneling between the hybridized carriers, we significantly extend the formation time of hybrid excitons, while simultaneously increasing their decay times. Our findings have implications for the search on quantum blockade and condensation of excitons and dipolaritons in two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <h2>Topological interactions in vortex-wave collisions in Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vebjørn Øvereng, Andrew Baggaley, Luiza Angheluta</p>
            <p>We study vortex-vortex and vortex-wave collisions in two-dimensional weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates, processes that play a central role in decaying quantum turbulence. Using numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we show that during collisions of vortex-antivortex dipoles, the kinetic energy is transferred from incompressible to compressible modes by two distinct mechanisms. Below the critical vortex separation for annihilation, the transfer is mediated by quantum energy released during annihilation events, while above the threshold it arises from vortex acceleration. In wave-vortex collisions, an incoming solitary wave splits into transient phase slips that interact with the vortex, one of the phase slips contributes to vortex annihilation, and the other phase slip acquires a stable core and forms a new vortex. By analyzing vortex trajectories and energy spectra, we provide new insights into energy transfer mechanisms in quantum turbulence and offer broader implications for topological interactions mediated by vortices.</p>

            <h2>Pulsed-laser induced gold microparticle fragmentation by thermal strain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yogesh Pokhrel, Meike Tack, Sven Reichenberger, Matteo Levantino, Anton Plech</p>
            <p>Laser fragmentation of suspended microparticles is an upcoming alternative to laser ablation in liquid (LAL) that allows to streamline the the delivery process and optimize the irradiation conditions for best efficiency. Yet, the structural basis of this process is not well understood to date. Herein we employed ultrafast x-ray scattering upon picosecond laser excitation of a gold microparticle suspension in order to understand the thermal kinetics as well as structure evolution after fragmentation. The experiments are complemented by simulations according to the two-temperature model to verify the spatiotemporal temperature distribution. It is found that above a fluence threshold of 750 J/m$^2$ the microparticles are fragmented within a nanosecond into several large pieces where the driving force is the strain due to a strongly inhomogenous heat distribution on the one hand and stress confinement due to the ultrafast heating compared to stress propagation on the other hand. The additional limited formation of small clusters is attributed to photothermal decomposition on the front side of the microparticles at the fluence of 2700 J/m$^2$.</p>

            <h2>Ab initio calculation of atomic solid hydrogen phases based on Gutzwiller many-body wave functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuo Ye, Jun Liu, Yong-Xin Yao, Feng Zhang, Kai-Ming Ho, Cai-Zhuang Wang</p>
            <p>We apply two ab initio many-body methods based on Gutzwiller wave functions, i.e., correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) and Gutzwiller conjugate gradient minimization (GCGM), to the study of crystalline phases of atomic hydrogen. Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by including the correlation energy from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+ produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen lattice systems.</p>

            <h2>Effective-medium theory for elastic systems with correlated disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge M. Escobar-Agudelo, Rui Aquino, Danilo B. Liarte</p>
            <p>Correlated structures are intimately connected to intriguing phenomena exhibited by a variety of disordered systems such as soft colloidal gels, bio-polymer networks and colloidal suspensions near a shear jamming transition. The universal critical behavior of these systems near the onset of rigidity is often described by traditional approaches as the coherent potential approximation - a versatile version of effective-medium theory that nevertheless have hitherto lacked key ingredients to describe disorder spatial correlations. Here we propose a multi-purpose generalization of the coherent potential approximation to describe the mechanical behavior of elastic networks with spatially-correlated disorder. We apply our theory to a simple rigidity-percolation model for colloidal gels and study the effects of correlations in both the critical point and the overall scaling behavior. We find that although the presence of spatial correlations (mimicking attractive interactions of gels) shifts the critical packing fraction to lower values, suggesting sub-isostatic behavior, the critical coordination number of the associated network remains isostatic. More importantly, we discuss how our theory can be employed to describe a large variety of systems with spatially-correlated disorder.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Effects or Theoretical Artifacts? A Computational Reanalysis of Hydrogen at High-Pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Racioppi, Eva Zurek</p>
            <p>The stability of high-pressure phases of hydrogen remains a central question in condensed matter physics, where both experimental observations and theoretical predictions are highly sensitive to methodological choices. Here, we revisit the cold phase diagram of hydrogen between 400 and 700 GPa using the meta-GGA functionals (R2SCAN and SCAN0) and compare the results with the more common PBE. At the meta-GGA level, molecular phases (Cmca-4, Cmca-12, and C2/c) are stabilized over the atomic I41/amd phase up to significantly higher pressures than predicted by GGA, in closer agreement with diffusion Monte Carlo calculations and experimental observations of band-gap closure near 425 GPa. Furthermore, phonon spectra calculated with R2SCAN show that the dynamical instabilities and anharmonic signatures previously predicted at the GGA level vanish, indicating that such effects may partly arise from functional deficiencies rather than genuine nuclear quantum effects. Bonding analysis reveals that PBE artificially weakens intramolecular H-H bonds and enhances intermolecular interactions through charge delocalization, whereas meta-GGA preserves a more localized molecular character. Anharmonic motion remains relevant for finite-temperature dynamics; however, we demonstrate that the accurate description of the potential energy surface - particularly its curvature near equilibrium - is pivotal for assessing both phase stability and bonding of hydrogen at high-pressure.</p>

            <h2>A spectrum of p-atic symmetries and defects in confluent epithelia</h2>

            <p>Topological defects provide a unifying language to describe how orientational order breaks down in active and living matter. Considering cells as elongated particles confluent, epithelial tissues can be interpreted as nematic fields and its defects have been linked to extrusion, migration, and morphogenetic transformations. Yet, epithelial cells are not restricted to nematic order: their irregular shapes can express higher rotational symmetries, giving rise to p-atic order. Here we introduce a framework to extract p-atic fields and their defects directly from experimental images. Applying this method to MDCK cells, we find that all symmetries generate this http URL strong positional or orientational correlations are found between nematic and hexatic defects, suggesting that different symmetries coexist largely independently. These results demonstrate that epithelial tissues should not be described by nematic order alone, but instead host a spectrum of p-atic symmetries. Our work provides the first direct experimental evidence for this multivalency of order and offers a route to test and refine emerging p-atic liquid crystal theories of living matter.</p>

            <p>Selectively exciting and manipulating phonons at nanoscale becomes more and more important but still remains challenging in modern nano-energy control and information sensing. Here, we show that the phonon spin angular momentum provides an extra degree of freedom to achieve versatile manipulation of axial phonons in nanomaterials via coupling to spinful multi-physical fields, such as circularly polarized infrared absorption. In particular, we demonstrate the nanoscale one-way axial phonon excitation and routing in chiral nanomaterials, by converting the photon spin in circularly polarized optical fields into the collective interference phonon spin. As exemplified in the smallest chiral carbon nanotube, we show that the rectification rate can reach nearly 100\%, achieving an ideal one-way phonon router, which is verified by molecular dynamics simulations. Our results shed new light on the flexible phonon manipulation via phonon spin degree of freedom, paving the way for future spin phononics.</p>

            <p>Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</p>

            <h2>Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reetendra Singh, Abhishek Rakshit, Galit Atiya, Michael Kalina, Yaron Kauffmann, Yoav Kalcheim</p>
            <p>The V2O3 phase diagram contains two insulating phases and one metallic phase with different lattice structures. The stability of these phases is very sensitive to pressure, offering a mechanism to tune phase transitions by inducing strain in thin films. The most studied source of strain is lattice mismatch between the film and the substrate. In this work, however, we find that the film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch can be made to play a dominant role by modifying the substrate morphology. When grown on sapphire, the lattice mismatch induces compressive strain in the V2O3 films, whereas thermal expansion mismatch induces tensile strain. We find that minute changes in substrate morphology may relax the compressive strain component, allowing the thermally-induced tensile component to overcome it. Thus, by simple annealing of the substrates to create either a flat or stepped morphology, strongly compressive or tensile strains may be induced in the films. This results in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or stabilization of insulating phases at all temperatures, exhibiting many orders of magnitude differences in film resistivity. To elucidate the strain relaxation mechanism, we use high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent crystallographic defects in the V2O3. These findings offer a hitherto underexplored mechanism to tune strain in thin films, deepen our understanding of the effects of structural degrees of freedom on phase stability of a canonical Mott insulator and may allow for applications requiring insulator-metal switching above room temperature.</p>

            <h2>Fate of entanglement in open quantum spin liquid: Time evolution of its genuine multipartite negativity upon sudden coupling to a dissipative bosonic environment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Federico Garcia-Gaitan, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.</p>

            <h2>Quantum gates in coupled quantum dots controlled by coupling modulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alejandro D. Bendersky, Sergio S. Gomez, Rodolfo H. Romero</p>
            <p>We studied the dynamics of a pair of single-electron double quantum dots (DQD) under longitudinal and transverse static magnetic fields and time-dependent harmonic modulation of their interaction couplings. We propose to modulate the tunnel coupling between the QDs to produce one-qubit gates and the exchange coupling between DQDs to generate entangling gates, the set of operations required for quantum computing. We developed analytical approximations to set the conditions to control the qubits and applied them to numerical calculations to test the accuracy and robustness of the analytical model. The results shows that the unitary evolution of the two-electron state performs the designed operations even under conditions shifted from the ideal ones.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoshi Jiang, Bartomeu Monserrat, Wei Ku</p>
            <p>Charge order is a widely observed and representative example of spontaneous broken symmetries in quantum states of matter. Owing to the large intra-atomic Coulomb energy, the charge redistribution in such an order typically implies significant alteration of the electronic and lattice properties of materials. While the standard description of charge order, namely a "charge density wave" instability of the Fermi surface, has been broadly and successfully applied to good metals, its applicability to correlated ionic materials has been rather limited. Here, we propose an alternative general scenario of charge order - crystallization of long-lived Frenkel excitons - suitable for these ionic materials. We demonstrate this scenario on the recently discovered kagome superconductors and successfully reproduce all the characteristics of experimental observations on both local charge correlations and long-range ordering. The proposed generic scenario offers a long-sought understanding of charge order applicable to modern correlated functional materials.</p>

            <h2>Amplified magnetic catalysis in non-Hermitian Euclidean and hyperbolic Dirac liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher A. Leong, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Due to their iconic linearly vanishing density of states near the zero-energy, half-filled two-dimensional Dirac materials in flat Euclidean and negatively-curved hyperbolic spaces exhibit dynamic mass generation only once a critical interaction strength is surpassed. Application of external magnetic fields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered phases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak coupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been proposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to feature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the zero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific family of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite value in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis (arXiv:2501.18591). Here, we predict that a confluence of external magnetic fields and such a non-Hermiticity can amplify the magnitude of commuting class masses for subcritical strengths of interactions in Dirac liquids, an emergent phenomenon named non-Hermitian amplification of magnetic catalysis. We anchor this prediction from numerical self-consistent mean-field solutions of the commuting class mass charge-density-wave (antiferromagnetic) order displaying a staggered pattern of average electronic density (magnetization) between the nearest neighboring sites of the half-filled Euclidean honeycomb and hyperbolic {10, 3} and {14, 3} lattices, all featuring emergent non-Hermitian Dirac quasiparticles, after decomposing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb (on-site Hubbard) repulsion in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling behavior of these two orders with magnetic field and non-Hermiticity over a wide range of subcritical interactions.. Possible experimental setups to test our predictions are discussed.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subham Ghosh, Abhishek Tewari</p>
            <p>The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large, machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on 50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units, spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond thermoelectrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Souvik Bandyopadhyay, Anushya Chandran, Philip JD Crowley</p>
            <p>Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</p>

            <p>Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tanausú Hernández-Yanes, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski, Marcin Płodzień</p>
            <p>Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum (beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and can be measured by stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). For permutationally symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems, only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators. This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols, which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT), the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller, system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness, multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Signatures of Strange Attractors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bence Dárdai, Gábor Vattay</p>
            <p>In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system, using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Desheng Ma, David A Muller, Steven E Zeltmann</p>
            <p>Tilt-corrected imaging methods in four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) have recently emerged as a new class of direct ptychography methods that are especially useful at low dose. The operation of tilt correction unfolds the contrast transfer functions (CTF) of the virtual bright-field images and retains coherence by correcting defocus-induced spatial shifts. By performing summation or subtraction of the tilt-corrected images, the real or imaginary parts of the complex phase-contrast transfer functions are recovered, producing a tilt-corrected bright field image (tcBF) or a differential phase contrast image (tcDPC). However, the CTF can be strongly damped by the introduction of higher-order aberrations than defocus. In this paper, we show how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which combines tcBF and tcDPC, enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. At Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing oscillations from the acBF CTF. We demonstrate acBF on both simulated and experimental data, showing it produces superior performance to tcBF or DPC methods alone, and discuss its limitations.</p>

            <p>Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.</p>

            <p>Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel, FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to 18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline. With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106 parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Wakatsuki, Kiyoshi Kanazawa</p>
            <p>The Santa Fe model is an established econophysics model for describing stochastic dynamics of the limit order book from the viewpoint of the zero-intelligence approach. While its foundation was studied by combining a dimensional analysis and a mean-field theory by E. Smith et al. in Quantitative Finance 2003, their arguments are rather heuristic and lack solid mathematical foundation; indeed, their mean-field equations were derived with heuristic arguments and their solutions were not explicitly obtained. In this work, we revisit the mean-field theory of the Santa Fe model from the viewpoint of kinetic theory -- a traditional mathematical program in statistical physics. We study the exact master equation for the Santa Fe model and systematically derive the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchical equation. By applying the mean-field approximation, we derive the mean-field equation for the order-book density profile, parallel to the Boltzmann equation in conventional statistical physics. Furthermore, we obtain explicit and closed expression of the mean-field solutions. Our solutions have several implications: (1)Our scaling formulas are available for both $\mu\to 0$ and $\mu\to \infty$ asymptotics, where $\mu$ is the market-order submission intensity. Particularly, the mean-field theory works very well for small $\mu$, while its validity is partially limited for large $\mu$. (2)The ``method of image'' solution, heuristically derived by Bouchaud-Mézard-Potters in Quantitative Finance 2002, is obtained for large $\mu$, serving as a mathematical foundation for their heuristic arguments. (3)Finally, we point out an error in E. Smith et al. 2003 in the scaling law for the diffusion constant due to a misspecification in their dimensional analysis.</p>

Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.</p>

However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity.

We show that this problem in its QUBO form can be swiftly and consistently solved for chain length 48, using either classical simulated annealing or hybrid quantum-classical annealing on a D-Wave system. In fact, the latter computations required about 10 seconds. We also test linear and quadratic programming methods, which work well for a lattice gas but struggle with chain constraints.

Analyzing this effective process yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.</p>

            <p>Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.</p>

            <p>Quantum phenomena offer the possibility of measuring physical quantities with precision beyond classical limits. However, current progress is constrained by scalability, environmental noise, and challenges in practical integration. This highlights the necessity for novel approaches. An emerging paradigm in this direction is \emph{critical quantum metrology} -- which harnesses the enhanced susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic open-system and dissipative regimes, and outline both the challenges and opportunities for future quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Improving neural network performance for solving quantum sign structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaowei Ou, Tianshu Huang, Vidvuds Ozolins</p>
            <p>Neural quantum states have emerged as a widely used approach to the numerical study of the ground states of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians. However, existing approaches often rely on a priori knowledge of the sign structure or require a separately pre-trained phase network. We introduce a modified stochastic reconfiguration method that effectively uses differing imaginary time steps to evolve the amplitude and phase. Using a larger time step for phase optimization, this method enables a simultaneous and efficient training of phase and amplitude neural networks. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on the Heisenberg J_1-J_2 model.</p>

            <h2>Quantum speed-up for solving the one-dimensional Hubbard model using quantum annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kunal Vyas, Fengping Jin, Hans De Raedt, Kristel Michielsen</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model has occupied the minds of condensed matter physicists for most part of the last century. This model provides insight into a range of phenomena in correlated electron systems. We wish to examine the paradigm of quantum algorithms for solving such many-body problems. The focus of our current work is on the one-dimensional model which is integrable, meaning that there exist analytical results for determining its ground state. In particular, we demonstrate how to perform a gate-based quantum computer simulation of quantum annealing for the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We perform simulations for systems with up to 40 qubits to study the scaling of required annealing time for obtaining the ground state. We find that for the half-filled cases considered, there is a substantial quantum speed-up over algorithms based on the Bethe-ansatz equations.</p>

            <p>Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However, the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts. We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst. In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient catalysts.</p>

            <h2>Chaotic many-body quantum dynamics, spectral correlations, and energy diffusion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. T. Chalker, Dominik Hahn</p>
            <p>We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to much-studied quantum circuits, and is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Fisher information matrices from Rényi relative entropies</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mark M. Wilde</p>
            <p>Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the Rényi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric Rényi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean Rényi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric Rényi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ Rényi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</p>

            <p>Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and Néel-ordered phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase, distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics.</p>

            <h2>Transformers Discover Molecular Structure Without Graph Priors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Kreiman, Yutong Bai, Fadi Atieh, Elizabeth Weaver, Eric Qu, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan</p>
            <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max McGinley, Samuel J. Garratt</p>
            <p>We establish a relationship between the correlations in a many-qubit mixed state and the minimum circuit depth needed for its preparation. If the mutual information between two subsystems exceeds the mutual information between one of those subsystems and the environment, which purifies the mixed state of the system, then the past lightcones of the subsystems must intersect one another. This results in a lower bound on the circuit depth of any ensemble of geometrically local unitaries that prepares the state to some specified degree of approximation. As an application, we derive lower bounds on the circuit depth needed to prepare thermal states of one-dimensional quantum critical systems described by conformal field theory, showing that the depth diverges as temperature is decreased up to a cutoff set by the preparation error.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Belief Propagation: Cluster-Corrected Tensor Network Contraction with Exponential Convergence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhant Midha, Yifan F. Zhang</p>
            <p>Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.</p>

            <p>High entropy alloys (HEA) represent a class of materials with promising properties, such as high strength and ductility, radiation damage tolerance, etc. At the same time, a combinatorially large variety of compositions and a complex structure render them quite hard to study using conventional methods. In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology based on ab initio calculations within the coherent potential approximation. To make the methodology predictive, we apply an exchange-correlation correction to the equation of state and take into account thermal effects on the magnetic state and the equilibrium volume. The approach shows good agreement with available experimental data on bulk properties of solid solutions. As a particular case, the workflow is applied to a series of iron-group HEA to investigate their solid solution strengthening within a parameter-free model based on the effective medium representation of an alloy. The results reveal intricate interactions between alloy components, which we analyze by means of a simple model of local bonding. Thanks to its computational efficiency, the methodology can be used as a basis for an adaptive learning workflow for optimal design of HEA.</p>

            <p>Nanofabricated metal gate electrodes are commonly used to confine and control electrons in electrostatically defined quantum dots. However, these same gates impart strain-induced potential fluctuations that can potentially impair device functionality. Here we investigate strain fluctuations in Si/SiGe heterostructures, caused by (i) lattice mismatch, (ii) materials-dependent thermal contraction, and (iii) depositional stress in the metal gates. By simulating gate geometries, ranging from simple to realistically complicated, we identify two opposing effects in overlapping gate structures: (a) gate-driven behavior arising from isolated gates vs (b) oxide-driven behavior arising from the thin oxides separating the gates in an overlapping geometry. These limiting behaviors induce strains of opposite sign, pointing towards the possibility of suppressing strain fluctuations through careful design. Here, we demonstrate nearly total suppression of short-range strain fluctuation through device optimization. These results suggest that strain fluctuations should not pose an insurmountable challenge to qubit uniformity, provided that oxide and overlapping gate thicknesses can be tuned.</p>

We present a general mean-field decoupling of the Hamiltonian, and discuss in detail the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mean-field solutions. We calculate the eigen-energies, occupations, spin densities and addition energies of rectangulenes with lengths and widths ranging from a nanometer to several hundreds of them. We rewrite the exact mean-field tight-binding Hamiltonian back in the site-occupation basis, that can be used to model electronic, thermo-electric, transport and optical properties of experimental-size graphene flakes.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the phenomenon of the early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, where materials undergo solidification upon impact. While Stokes flow theory traditionally applies to suspensions with micrometer-sized particles due to their low Reynolds numbers, suspensions containing larger particles defy such idealizations. Our work focuses on the early-stage impact-induced hardening of suspensions containing millimeter-sized particles through dynamic impact experiments. We are particularly interested in the maximum drag force $F_\mathrm{max}$ acting on the projectile as a function of the impact speed $u_0$. We successfully conducted experiments using these suspensions and confirmed the relation $F_\mathrm{max}\sim u_0^{3/2}$ for relatively large $u_0$ as observed in the previous studies suspensions of micrometer-sized particles. Our findings reveal that the early-stage behaviors of millimeter-sized particle suspensions align well with predictions from the floating model, typically applicable under Stokes flow conditions. This research sheds light on the complex dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, particularly with larger particles, advancing our understanding beyond conventional micrometer-sized systems.</p>

The cantilever position is rapidly sampled and the feedback is triggered by the first passage of the system across a fixed threshold. The information $\Delta I$ associated with the feedback is based on the first-passage-time distribution. In this setting, we derive and experimentally verify two distinct fluctuation theorems that involve $\Delta I$ and give a tight bound on the work produced by the engine. Our results extend beyond the specific application to our experiment: we develop a general framework for obtaining fluctuation theorems and work bounds, formulated in terms of probability distributions of protocols rather than underlying measurement outcomes.</p>

            <p>Magnetic solitons such as skyrmions and bimerons show great promise for both fundamental research and spintronic applications. Stabilizing and controlling topological spin textures in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) materials has gained tremendous attention due to high tunability, enhanced functionality, and miniaturization. Here, we present an efficient spin-spiral approach based on first-principles, a method for mapping magnetic interactions from collective models onto arbitrary lattice symmetries, such as hexagonal and honeycomb lattices. Using atomistic spin models parametrized from first-principles, we predict the emergence of multiple topological spin textures in an all-magnetic vdW heterostructure Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (FGT/CGT) -- an experimentally feasible system. Interestingly, the FGT layer favors out-of-plane magnetization, whereas the CGT layer prefers in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Néel-type nanoscale skyrmions are formed at zero field in the FGT layer due to interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), while nanoscale bimerons and antibimerons can co-exist in the CGT layer by the interplay between exchange frustration and DMI. Using the collective approach we apply, we reveal significant discretization effects in hexagonal and honeycomb geometries. In particular, we demonstrate that the lifting of geometric exchange frustration on the honeycomb significantly affects soliton barriers and pinning energetics. These fundamental results not only highlight the importance of spin simulations in discrete models for topological magnetism, especially in 2D materials, but may also help to pave the way for solitonic devices based on atomically thin vdW heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We propose a geometric series modulated non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice model, and explore its localization and topological properties. The results show that with the ever-increasing summation terms of the geometric series, multiple mobility edges and non-Hermitian point gaps with high winding number can be induced in the system. The point gap spectrum of the system has a multi-loop nested structure in the complex plane, resulting in a high winding number. In addition, we analyze the limit case of summation of infinite terms. The results show that the mobility edges merge together as only one mobility edge when summation terms are pushed to the limit. Meanwhile, the corresponding point gaps are merged into a ring with winding number equal to one. Through Avila's global theory, we give an analytical expression for mobility edges in the limit of infinite summation, reconfirming that mobility edges and point gaps do merge and will result in a winding number that is indeed equal to one.</p>

We show how to construct the scattering matrix for the matter excitations and give a general expression for the energy current in terms of this scattering matrix. We show that the energy current has an important non-dissipative contribution that can dominate the finite-frequency noise while being absent in the average current.

We also demonstrate that the NH spin center exhibits a relatively long coherence time, making it a strong candidate for quantum sensing.

            <p>Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.</p>

            <p>The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next generation photovoltaic applications, attracting significant attention in recent years. Through first-principles calculations combined with group-theoretical analyses, we investigate the structural phase diagram of Pb-free Jahn-Teller-active $A_2$Au$_2X_6$ ($A$: Cs, Rb; $X$: Cl, Br, I) double perovskites. Our study identifies a previously unreported ferroelectric phase, where the softening of the polar mode$, $key to ferroelectricity, is driven by an unconventional and indirect coupling with improper strains originating from Jahn-Teller distortions. The proposed strain mediated \textit{pseudo}triggered mechanism offers an alternative pathway to enhance the static dielectric constant or even promote (photo-)ferroelectricity, addressing challenges such as defects, excitons, and charge scattering that hinder photovoltaic efficiency. More broadly, this unique mechanism could be extended to oxide double perovskites and opens up a new type of ferroelectric phase transition worthy of future investigation.</p>

Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulation to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge density wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</p>

            <p>Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of flexible quasispherical vesicles that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We show that the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving gives rise to a morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. Additionally, we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law, derived using insights from stochastic thermodynamics, that robustly describes vesicle growth dynamics even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.</p>

            <h2>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Duy-Nhat Ly, Dai-Nam Le, Dang-Khoa D. Le, Van-Hoang Le</p>
            <p>We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for extracting material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium from experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach relies on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{ö}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends solely on the single material parameter $\mu$. Furthermore, we develop an analytical formula with high accuracy for magnetoexciton energies as a function of the exciton reduced mass: $E(B,\mu)$. Then, the inverse of this formula allows us to calculate the exciton reduced mass from experimental data on magnetoexciton energies. By applying this method, we extract key material parameters, $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$, from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$, encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. The material properties we retrieve complement and correct existing experimental and theoretical data. Additionally, we develop an analytical method for calculating diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii with high accuracy compared to numerical calculations. Based on this method, we provide diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii computed using the extracted material parameters.</p>

            <h2>Gapfull and gapless $1$D Topological Superconductivity in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bilayer Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Skliannyi, Yuval Oreg, Ady Stern</p>
            <p>We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</p>

Using the method of direct integration the equation of motion, pioneered by Kac, we obtain exact moments for the Laplace transform of the time dependent ABRTP, in the presence or absence of a harmonic trap. In addition we estimate the distribution moments with the help of the Chebyshev polynomials. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments.</p>

            <h2>Non-reciprocal anti-aligning active mixtures: deriving the exact Boltzmann collision operator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakob Mihatsch, Thomas Ihle</p>
            <p>We consider the effect of non-reciprocity in a binary mixture of self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions, where a particle of type A reacts differently to a particle of type B than vice versa. Starting from a well-known microscopic Langevin-model for the particles, setting up the corresponding exact N-particle Fokker-Planck equation and making Boltzmann's assumptions of low density and one-sided molecular chaos, the non-linear active Boltzmann equation with the exact collision operator is derived. In this derivation, the effect of phase-space compression and the build-up of pair-correlations during binary interactions is explicitly taken into account, leading to a theoretical description beyond mean-field. This extends previous results for reciprocal interactions, where it was found that orientational order can emerge in a system with purely anti-aligning interactions. Although the equations of motion are more complex than in the reciprocal system, the theory still leads to analytical expressions and predictions. Comparisons with agent-based simulations show excellent quantitative agreement of the dynamic and static behavior in the low density and/or small coupling limit.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic Interactions and Cluster Formation: Boosting Surface Thermopower in Topological Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Tirgar, H. Barati Abgarmi, J. Abouie</p>
            <p>This study presents a theoretical investigation of the thermoelectric properties of three-dimensional magnetic topological insulators (TIs), with a focus on the role of exchange interactions between magnetic dopants. The presence of these magnetic atoms on the TI surface modulates the local magnetic order, which in turn alters the electronic band structure and surface transport phenomena. Magnetic correlations, such as those arising from ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic exchange, promote cluster formation, magnetic domain structures, and spin fluctuations, all of which critically influence thermoelectric responses. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on Ising and Heisenberg models of these surface exchange interactions, we analyze how magnetic clustering, particularly near the surface critical temperature, affects relaxation dynamics, electrical and thermal resistivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the thermoelectric figure of merit. Our results demonstrate that exchange-driven magnetic clustering enhances the scattering of Dirac surface states, thereby increasing the thermoelectric power factor. Specifically, optimized interlayer and intralayer exchange interactions can elevate the surface thermopower beyond levels observed in conventional spin-based thermoelectric materials. These findings highlight the significant potential of magnetic TIs for thermoelectric applications and provide a foundation for future experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic correlations in topologically nontrivial systems.</p>

Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</p>

            <h2>Disentangling contributions to longitudinal magnetoconductivity for Kramers-Weyl nodes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ipsita Mandal</p>
            <p>We set out to compute the longitudinal magnetoconductivity for an isolated and isotropic Kramers-Weyl node (KWN), existing in chiral crystals, which forms an exotic cousin of the conventional Weyl nodes resulting from band-inversions. The peculiarities of KWNs are many, the principal one being the presence of two concentric Fermi surfaces at any positive chemical potential ($\mu$) with respect to the nodal point. This is caused by a dominant quadratic-in-momentum dispersion, with the linear-in-momentum Dirac- or Weyl-like terms relegated to a secondary status. In a KWN, the chirally-conjugate node typically serves as a mere doppelgänger, being significantly separated in energy. Hence, when $\mu$ is set near such a node, the signatures of a lone node are probed in the transport-measurements. The intrinsic topological quantities in the forms of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment contribute to the linear response, which we determine by exactly solving the semiclassical Bolzmann equations. Another crucial feature is that the two bands at the same KWN node carry actual spin-quantum numbers, thus providing an additional coupling to an external magnetic field ($\boldsymbol B$), and affecting the conductivity. We take this into account as well, and demonstrate that it causes a linear-in-$B$ dependence, on top of the usual $B^2$-dependence.</p>

            <h2>Fokker-Planck Score Learning: Efficient Free-Energy Estimation under Periodic Boundary Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Nagel, Tristan Bereau</p>
            <p>Accurate free-energy estimation is essential in molecular simulation, yet the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) commonly used in computer simulations have rarely been explicitly exploited. Equilibrium methods such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and adaptive biasing force require extensive sampling, while non-equilibrium pulling with Jarzynski's equality suffers from poor convergence due to exponential averaging. Here, we introduce a physics-informed, score-based diffusion framework: by mapping PBC simulations onto a Brownian particle in a periodic potential, we derive the Fokker-Planck steady-state score that directly encodes free-energy gradients. A neural network is trained on non-equilibrium trajectories to learn this score, providing a principled scheme to efficiently reconstruct the potential of mean force (PMF). On benchmark periodic potentials and small-molecule membrane permeation, our method is up to one order of magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan Gao, Yixuan Huang, Sadamichi Maekawa, Wei Li</p>
            <p>Using thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. For the 1D Heisenberg chain, we find a negative spinon spin in the bulk current with algebraic temperature scaling; at low fields, boundary effects induce a second sign reversal at lower temperatures. These benchmark results are consistent with field-theoretical analysis. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures -- particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence -- distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive spin current probes for spin supersolid states in quantum magnets such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results also establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.</p>

            <h2>The Symmetry Taco: Equivalences between Gapped, Gapless, and Mixed-State SPTs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Qi, Ramanjit Sohal, Xie Chen, David T. Stephen, Abhinav Prem</p>
            <p>Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences, including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in $1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state ``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cliff Sun, Ziqi Zhao, Alexey Bezryadin</p>
            <p>Diodes have a nonreciprocal voltage versus current relationship, produced by breaking the space and time reversal symmetry. However, developing high-end superconducting computers requires a superconducting analogue of the traditional semiconductor diode. Such a superconducting diode exhibits non-reciprocity, or a high asymmetry in its critical currents. We present a model of a perfect superconducting diode based on a superconducting quantum interference device made with multiple superconducting nanowires. The diode predicted by our model has a large positive critical current, while the negative critical current can be exactly zero. This 100\% diode efficiency ($\eta = 1$) remains stable against small changes of the magnetic field. Another important result is that under certain and quite broad conditions such devices can act as supercurrent range controllers. In such device a supercurrent can flow with zero voltage applied, but only if the supercurrent is contained in some narrow, adjustable range, which excludes zero current.</p>

            <p>Spatial entanglement of wave functions has matured into an enthralling and very active research area. Here, we unearth a completely different kind of entanglement, the entanglement between different time scales. This is feasible through quantics tensor train diagnostics (QTTD), wherein the bond dimension for an $n$-particle correlation function allows diagnosing the temporal entanglement. As examples, we study time-scale entanglement of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. Besides introducing the QTTD method, our major finding is that the time-scale entanglement is generically maximal at phase transitions and crossovers. This is independent of the correlation function studied. Thus, QTTD is a universal tool for detecting quantum phase transitions, ground state crossings in finite systems, and thermal crossovers.</p>

            <p>Accurately predicting lattice thermal conductivity (kL) from first principles remains a challenge in identifying materials with extreme thermal behavior. While modern lattice dynamics methods enable routine predictions of kL within the harmonic approximation and three-phonon scattering framework (HA+3ph), reliable results, especially for low-kL compounds, require higher-order anharmonic effects, including self-consistent phonon renormalization, four-phonon scattering, and off-diagonal heat flux (SCPH+3,4ph+OD). We present a high-throughput workflow integrating these effects into a unified framework. Using this, we compute kL for 773 cubic and tetragonal inorganic compounds across diverse chemistries and structures. From 562 dynamically stable compounds, we assess the hierarchical effects of higher-order anharmonicity. For about 60% of materials, HA+3ph predictions closely match those from SCPH+3,4ph+OD. However, SCPH corrections often increase kL, sometimes by over 8 times, while four-phonon scattering universally reduces it, occasionally to 15% of the HA+3ph value. Off-diagonal contributions are minor in high-kL systems but can be comparable to the diagonal ones in highly anharmonic, low-kL compounds. We highlight four cases-Rb2TlAlH6, Cu3VS4, CuBr, and KTlCl4-exhibiting distinct anharmonic behaviors. This work delivers not only a robust workflow for high-fidelity kL dataset but also a quantitative framework to determine when higher-order effects are essential. The hierarchy of kL results, from the HA+3ph to SCPH+3,4ph+OD level, offers a scalable, interpretable route to discovering next-generation extreme thermal materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingru Yang, Sajant Anand, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen</p>
            <p>The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, which increases exponentially with decreasing temperature. The dopant, hereby, only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes at rate $\alpha$, the dopant diffuses with a diffusion coefficient, $D_h$, depending non-monotonically on $\alpha$. It initially increases linearly as $D_h \propto \alpha$ for $\alpha \ll 1$ before dropping off as $\alpha^{-1}$ for $\alpha > 1$. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics features self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion, especially for weak spin exchange. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient $D_h$ follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it is exponentially suppressed upon cooling.</p>

We demonstrate the utility of the general theory using concrete examples of electric and magnetic multipole order in variants of lonsdaleite and diamond structures. Besides the magnetic dipole density in ferromagnets, we also consider, e.g., the magnetic octupole density in altermagnets. The robust method developed in this work lends itself to be incorporated into the suite of computational materials-science tools.

            <p>We propose generalized variants of the $XY$ model capable of exhibiting an arbitrary number of phase transitions only by varying temperature. They are constructed by supplementing the magnetic coupling with $n_t-1$ nematic terms of exponentially increasing order with the base $q=2,3,4$ and $5$, and increasing interaction strength. It is found that for $q=2,3$ and $4$ with sufficiently large coupling strength of the final term, the models exhibit a number of phase transitions equal to the number of the terms in the generalized Hamiltonian. Starting from the paramagnetic phase, the system transitions through the cascade of $n_t-1$ nematic phases of the orders $q^{k}$, $k=n_t-1,n_t-2,\hdots,1$, that are characterized by $q^{k}$ preferential spin directions symmetrically disposed around the circle, to the ferromagnetic (FM) phase at the lowest temperatures. Besides the BKT transition from the paramagnetic phase, all the remaining transitions have a non-BKT nature: depending on the value of $q$ they belong to either the Ising ($q=2$ and $4$) or the three-states Potts ($q=3$) universality class. For $q=5$, due to the interplay between different terms, the phase transitions between the ordered phases observed for $q<5$ split into two and the number of the ordered phases increases to $2n_t-1$. These phases are characterized by a domain structure with the gradually increasing short-range FM ordering within domains that extends to different kinds of FM ordering in the last two low-temperature phases. The respective transitions do not seem to obey any universality.</p>

The code directly extracts eigenvalues and momentum-matrix elements from WIEN2k calculations and evaluates the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) using a Kubo-like formalism. For computational efficiency, C-BerryTrans parallelizes $\boldsymbol\Omega$ evaluation over k-points using OpenMP and stores band-resolved curvature in binary format. This design enables rapid post-processing of AHC and ANC over a wide range of temperatures and chemical potentials ($\mu$) in a single run. The code has been benchmarked on well-studied ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Fe$_3$Ge, Pd, Fe$_3$Al, and Co$_2$FeAl). For Fe, the $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$775 ($\sim$744) $S/cm$ at 0 (300) K. In case of Fe$_3$Ge, the calculated value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is found to be 311 $S/cm$ at the room temperature. Nextly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of computed value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ at 2 K is found to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$. Next, magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for Pd is obtained to be $\sim$0.97 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. For Fe$_3$Al, the maximum magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for $T\leq$500 K is computed as $\sim$2.83 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$. Lastly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the value of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$0.10 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. These results show good agreement with previously reported data. With its accuracy, scalability, and user-friendly workflow, C-BerryTrans provides a powerful tool for exploring $\boldsymbol\Omega$-driven transport phenomena and is well suited for high-throughput materials discovery.</p>

            <p>The ability to fabricate anisotropic superconducting layers a la carte is desired in technologies such as fluxon screening or removal in field-resilient devices, flux lensing in ultra-sensitive sensors, or in templates for imprinting magnetic structures in hybrid magnetic/superconducting multilayers. In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in microelectronic superconducting technology.</p>

            <p>The AM2Pn2 Zintl compounds are a large class of semiconductor materials that have a wide range of bandgaps and are mostly stable in the same crystal structure. Representative compounds BaCd2P2 and CaZn2P2 have recently been found to exhibit high visible light absorption and long carrier lifetime. Here we use high throughput first-principles calculations to study AM2Pn2 alloys for applications as tandem top cell absorbers (i.e., bandgaps around 1.8 eV) and far infrared detector materials (i.e., bandgaps lower than 0.5 eV). Using a first-principles computational screening workflow for assessing stability and electronic structure of alloys, we identify several promising candidates. These include Ca(Cd0.8Mg0.2)2P2 with a suitable direct bandgap for use in tandem top cells on silicon bottom cells and SrCd2(Sb1-xBix)2 for far infrared detectors. We demonstrate that alloys of AM2Pn2 materials can be realized by experimentally synthesizing Ca(Zn0.8Mg0.2)2P2.</p>

            <p>We analyze the implementation of high-fidelity, phonon-mediated gate operations and quantum simulation schemes for spin qubits associated with silicon vacancy centers in diamond. Specifically, we show how the application of continuous dynamical decoupling techniques can substantially boost the coherence of the qubit states while increasing at the same time the variety of effective spin models that can be implemented in this way. Based on realistic models and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this decoupling technique can suppress gate errors by more than two orders of magnitude and enable gate infidelities below $\sim 10^{-4}$ for experimentally relevant noise parameters. Therefore, when generalized to phononic lattices with arrays of implanted defect centers, this approach offers a realistic path toward moderate- and large-scale quantum devices with spins and phonons, at a level of control that is competitive with other leading quantum-technology platforms.</p>

            <p>Transformers have a remarkable ability to learn and execute tasks based on examples provided within the input itself, without explicit prior training. It has been argued that this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), is a cornerstone of Transformers' success, yet questions about the necessary sample complexity, pretraining task diversity, and context length for successful ICL remain unresolved. Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically-rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model's behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: In the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine in-context learning and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying non-Hermiticity using single- and many-particle quantum properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke, Sudipto Singha Roy</p>
            <p>The non-Hermitian paradigm of quantum systems displays salient features drastically different from Hermitian counterparts. In this work, we focus on one such aspect, the difference of evolving quantum ensembles under $H_{\mathrm{nh}}$ (right ensemble) versus its Hermitian conjugate, $H_{\mathrm{nh}}^{\dagger}$ (left ensemble). We propose a formalism that quantifies the (dis-)similarity of these right and left ensembles, for single- as well as many-particle quantum properties. Such a comparison gives us a scope to measure the extent to which non-Hermiticity gets translated from the Hamiltonian into physically observable properties. We test the formalism in two cases: First, we construct a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian using a set of imperfect Bell states, showing that the non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian does not automatically comply with the non-Hermiticity at the level of observables. Second, we study the interacting Hatano--Nelson model with asymmetric hopping as a paradigmatic quantum many-body Hamiltonian. Interestingly, we identify situations where the measures of non-Hermiticity computed for the Hamiltonian, for single-, and for many-particle quantum properties behave distinctly from each other. Thus, different notions of non-Hermiticity can become useful in different physical scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the measures can qualitatively mark the model's Parity--Time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition. Our findings can be instrumental in unveiling new exotic quantum phases of non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems as well as in preparing resourceful states for quantum technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meysam Mohseni, Lukas Razinkovas, Vytautas Žalandauskas, Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali</p>
            <p>In recent years, the negatively charged group-IV--vacancy defects in diamond, labeled as G4V(-) or G4V centers, have attracted significant attention in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up to 180 GPa. The spin-orbit splitting of the electronic ground and excited states, as well as the hyperfine tensors, are calculated using plane-wave supercell density functional theory, providing distinctive fingerprints that uniquely characterize these defects. To this end, we develop a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the electronic states are subject to the Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the zero-phonon-line energy increases with hydrostatic pressure, with the deformation potential increasing from SiV(-) to PbV(-). On the other hand, our calculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that PbV(-)-based quantum sensors can operate only up to 32 GPa, whereas SnV(-), GeV(-), and SiV(-) remain photostable up to 180 GPa. We also find that the spin-orbit splitting increases in both the electronic ground and excited states with increasing pressure. The optical transitions associated with the hyperfine fine structure of the dopant atoms are interpreted using our theoretical framework, which reproduces existing experimental data at zero strain. We show that the hyperfine levels are weakly dependent on magnetic field, and increasing pressure leads to optical transitions at longer wavelengths. Finally, we estimate the spin coherence times of the G4V centers under increasing hydrostatic pressure across different temperature regimes.</p>

            <p>Phonons play a central role in fundamental solid-state phenomena, including superconductivity, Raman scattering, and symmetry-breaking phases. Harnessing phonons to control these effects and enable quantum technologies is therefore of great interest. However, most existing phonon control strategies rely on external driving fields or anharmonic interactions, limiting their applicability. Here, we realize multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling and theoretically show the modulation of phonon emission. This regime is realized by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to a nanoslot array functioning as a single-mode cavity. The small mode volume of the nanoslots enables high coupling strengths in the phonon-polariton system. We show theoretically that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective interaction between phonon modes, leading to superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium between distinct modes. Our findings are well described by a multimode Hopfield model. This work establishes a pathway for engineering phononic properties for light-harvesting and light-emitting technologies.</p>

            <h2>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: Tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Th. K. Mavrogordatos</p>
            <p>We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime; an asymptotic law for the jump time is established in high-amplitude bistability. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grace M. Sommers, David A. Huse, Michael J. Gullans</p>
            <p>We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</p>

            <p>We report the fabrication and optical characterization of an air-suspended photonic crystal nanobeam cavity in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) realized by focused-ion-beam milling. YIG's combination of low optical loss and ferrimagnetism makes it highly attractive for quantum technologies, yet prior work has largely been focused on millimeter-scale spheres and simple microstructures, hindering true on-chip integration. Demonstrating nanometer-scale patterning in a suspended geometry therefore represents an important advance. Finite-element simulations predict that the same structure supports a flapping-type mechanical mode at $\Omega / 2\pi \approx 1.52 \,\text{GHz}$ and a backward-volume spin-wave mode at $\Omega / 2\pi = 11.59 \,\text{GHz}$ under an in-plane bias field. Although we measure only the photonic resonance (intrinsic $Q \sim 2 \times 10^{3}$) in this study, the device lays the groundwork for future exploration of coupled photon-phonon-magnon dynamics once higher optical quality factors are achieved.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayin Gu, Fan Zhang</p>
            <p>The time evolution of Markovian open quantum systems is governed by Lindblad master equations, whose solution can be formally written as the Lindbladian exponential acting on the initial density matrix. By expanding this Lindbladian exponential into the Taylor series, we propose a generic method for integrating Lindblad master equations. In this method, the series is truncated, retaining a finite number of terms, and the iterative actions of Lindbladian on the density matrix follow the corresponding master equation. Our method offers significant improvements in numerical efficiencies both in memory cost and computation time, especially for systems with many degrees of freedom. Moreover, our proposed method can be integrated seamlessly with tensor networks. Two illustrative examples, a two-level system exhibiting damped Rabi oscillations and a driven dissipative Heisenberg chain, are used to demonstrate the validity of our method. The superiority of our method is benchmarked with detailed performance tests.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Ishihara, Hideaki Shimazaki</p>
            <p>Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting economical computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.</p>

            <p>The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.</p>

            <p>A bootstrap program is presented for algebraically solving the $R$-matrix of a generic integrable quantum spin chain from its Hamiltonian. The Yang-Baxter equation contains an infinite number of seemingly independent constraints on the operator valued coefficients in the expansion of the $R$-matrices with respect to their spectral parameters, with the lowest order one being the Reshetikhin condition. These coefficients can be solved iteratively using Kennedy's inversion formula, which reconstructs the $R$-matrix after an infinite number of steps. For a generic Hamiltonian, the procedure could fail at any step, making the conditions useful as an integrability test. However in all known examples they all turn out to be satisfied whenever the lowest order condition is. It remains to be understood whether they are all implied by the Reshetikhin condition.</p>

            <p>Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and, via a statistical quasinormal mode analysis, interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation in semicontinuous metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include colour shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies, for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillermo Serrera, Yoshito Y. Tanaka, Pablo Albella</p>
            <p>Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables independent control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</p>

            <p>We study the effect of noise on the dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin correlations, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the noiseless case, in contrast to the dynamics of entanglement in anisotropic XY chains, both QFI and WYSI increase monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. In contrast, when noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change qualitatively: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with the time scale of a ramp quench, with an exponent determined by the noise intensity. Furthermore, the maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum, scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy quantum annealing.</p>

            <p>We provide new algorithms and provide example constructions of stabilizer models for the gapped boundaries, domain walls, and $0D$ defects of Abelian composite dimensional twisted quantum doubles. Using the physically intuitive concept of condensation, our algorithm explicitly describes how to construct the boundary and domain-wall stabilizers starting from the bulk model. This extends the utility of Pauli stabilizer models in describing non-translationally invariant topological orders with gapped boundaries. To highlight this utility, we provide a series of examples including a new family of quantum error-correcting codes where the double of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ is coupled to instances of the double semion (DS) phase. We discuss the codes' utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error correction with an emphasis on the interplay between deconfined anyons, logical operators, error rates and decoding. We also augment our construction, built using algorithmic tools to describe the properties of explicit stabilizer layouts at the microscopic lattice-level, with dimensional counting arguments and macroscopic-level constructions building on pants decompositions. The latter outlines how such codes' representation and design can be automated. Going beyond our worked out examples, we expect our explicit step-by-step algorithms to pave the path for new higher-algebraic-dimensional codes to be discovered and implemented in near-term architectures that take advantage of various hardware's distinct strengths.</p>

            <p>AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.</p>

            <p>This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS), which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains (Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics) can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer 2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of AI+MPS.</p>

            <h2>Higher-order, generically complete, continuous, and polynomial-time isometry invariants of periodic sets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel E Widdowson, Vitaliy A Kurlin</p>
            <p>Periodic point sets model all solid crystalline materials (crystals) whose atoms can be considered zero-sized points with or without atomic types. This paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic atomic replacements. Such near-duplicates have skewed ground-truth because past comparisons relied on unstable cells and symmetries. The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and detect thousands of (near-)duplicates in large high-profile databases of crystals within two days on a modest desktop computer.</p>

            <h2>A modular framework for collaborative human-AI, multi-modal and multi-beamline synchrotron experiments</h2>

            <p>High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.</p>

            <p>We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes across scales.</p>

            <h2>A study of the electronic and ionic structure, for co-existing states of fully and partially ionized hydrogen, using the neutral pseudo-atom method as well as a classical map for the electron subsystem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. W. C. Dharma-wardana</p>
            <p>Prof. Michael Bonitz and his collaborators have made seminal contributions to the study of the uniform electron fluid and the electron-proton fluid, viz., hydrogen, in using {\it ab initio} simulations. These studies provide essential inputs to astrophysics as well as high-energy density physics. This is reflected in the contributions to this festshrift in his honour. The electron-proton system becomes particularly difficult for theoretical modeling when the temperature becomes comparable to the Fermi energy $E_F$, when the warm-dense matter (WDM) state of hydrogen is reached. In this study we briefly review the theoretical methods available for the study of WDM systems, and use the neutral-pseudo atom (NPA) method, and a classical map for quantum electrons to study fully and partially ionized hydrogen. It is shown that {\it both} fully and partially ionized states can independently exist at the {\it same density and temperature} in many cases. Recent studies using path-integral Monte Carlo methods, and $N$-atom Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations have provided essential structure data including the electron-electron structure factor $S_{ee}(k)$ that enters into interpretation of X-ray Thomson scattering and other diagnostics. We show that these structure data can be rapidly and inexpensively evaluated, with sufficient accuracy, using classical-map schemes for fully ionized plasmas, and more generally, using one-atom (average-atom) DFT methods for partially ionized systems.</p>

            <h2>The Cryogenic Lagrangian Exploration Module: a rotating cryostat for the study of quantum vortices in Helium II via particle seeding</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeremy Vessaire, Charles Peretti, Florian Lorin, Emeric Durozoy, Gregory Garde, Panayotis Spathis, Benoit Chabaud, Mathieu Gibert</p>
            <p>The study of quantum vortex dynamics in HeII offers great potential for advancing quantum-fluid models. Bose-Einstein condensates, neutron stars, and even superconductors exhibit quantum vortices, whose interactions are crucial for dissipation in these systems. These vortices have quantized velocity circulation around their cores, which, in HeII, are of atomic size. They have been observed indirectly, through methods such as second sound attenuation or electron bubble imprints on photosensitive materials. Over the past twenty years, decorating cryogenic flows with particles has become a powerful approach to studying these vortices. However, recent particle visualization experiments often face challenges with stability, initial conditions, stationarity, and reproducibility. Moreover, most dynamical analyses are performed in 2D, even though many flows are inherently 3D. We constructed a rotating cryostat with optical ports on an elongated square cupola to enable 2D2C, 2D3C, and 3D3C Lagrangian and Eulerian studies of rotating HeII flow. Using this setup, individual quantum vortices have been tracked with micron-sized particles, as demonstrated by Peretti et al., Sci. Adv. 9, eadh2899 (2023). The cryostat and associated equipment -laser, cameras, sensors, and electronics- float on a 50 {\mu}m air cushion, allowing for precise control of the experiment's physical parameters. The performance during rotation is discussed, along with details on particle injection.</p>

            <h2>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abijith Krishnan, Ajesh Kumar, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</p>

            <h2>Continuum Fractons: Quantization and the Many Body Problem</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ylias Sadki, Abhishodh Prakash, S. L. Sondhi</p>
            <p>We formulate a continuum quantum mechanics for non-relativistic, dipole-conserving fractons. Imposing symmetries and locality results in novel phenomena absent in ordinary quantum mechanical systems. A single fracton has a vanishing Hamiltonian, and thus its spectrum is entirely composed of zero modes. For the two-body problem, the Hamiltonian is perfectly described by Sturm--Liouville (SL) theory. The effective two-body Hamiltonian is an SL operator on $(-1,1)$ whose spectral type is set by the edge behavior of the pair inertia function $K(x)\sim \lvert x -x_\mathrm{edge} \rvert^{\theta}$. We identify a sharp transition at $\theta=2$: for $\theta<2$ the spectrum is discrete and wavepackets reflect from the edges, whereas for $\theta>2$ the spectrum is continuous and wavepackets slow down and, dominantly, squeeze into asymptotically narrow regions at the edges. For three particles, the differential operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian is piecewise defined, requiring several "matching conditions" which cannot be analyzed as easily. We proceed with a lattice regularization that preserves dipole conservation, and implicitly selects a particular continuum Hamiltonian that we analyze numerically. We find a spectral transition in the three-body spectrum, and find evidence for quantum analogs of fracton attractors in both eigenstates and in the time evolution of wavepackets. We provide intuition for these results which suggests that the lack of ergodicity of classical continuum fractons will survive their quantization for large systems.</p>

            <p>The intricate competition between coexisting charge density waves (CDWs) can lead to rich phenomena, offering unique opportunities for phase manipulation through electromagnetic stimuli. Leveraging time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we demonstrate ultrafast control of a CDW in EuTe$_4$ upon optical excitation. At low excitation intensities, the amplitude of one of the coexisting CDW orders increases at the expense of the competing CDW, whereas at high intensities, it exhibits a nonmonotonic temporal evolution characterized by both enhancement and reduction. This transient bidirectional controllability, tunable by adjusting photo-excitation intensity, arises from the interplay between optical quenching and phase-competition-induced enhancement. Our findings, supported by phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory simulations, not only clarify the relationship between the two CDWs in EuTe$_4$, but also highlight the versatility of optical control over order parameters enabled by phase competition.</p>

            <h2>Excitons and Optical Response in Excitonic Insulator Candidate TiSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dino Novko</p>
            <p>The origin of the charge density wave (CDW) phase in TiSe$_2$ is a highly debated topic, with lattice and excitonic correlations proposed as the main driving mechanisms. One of the proposed scenarios is the excitonic insulator (EI) mechanism, where soft electronic mode drives the phase transition. However, the existence of this purely electronic mode is controversial. Here, we perform fully ab-initio calculations of the electron excitation spectra in TiSe$_2$ with electron-hole excitonic effects included via Bethe-Salpeter equations. In the normal high-temperature phase the excitation spectra is dominated by the exciton mode at 1.6 eV, while no well-defined soft electronic modes that could support the EI phase are present. In the CDW phase, the structural distortions induce a CDW band-gap opening between Ti-$d$ and Se-$p$ states, which supports the formation of the two low-energy excitonic modes in the optical spectrum at 0.4 eV and 80 meV. Close to the transition temperature $T_{\rm CDW}$, these two excitonic modes are softened and approach zero energy. These results suggest that the EI mechanism is not a main driving force in the formation of the CDW phase in TiSe$_2$, but there is a region in the phase diagram near $T_{\rm CDW}$ where EI fluctuations could be relevant.</p>

            <h2>Large superconducting diode effect driven by edge states in twisted iron-chalcogenide Josephson junctions</h2>

            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE)-the unidirectional, dissipationless flow of supercurrent-is a critical element for future superconducting electronics. Achieving high efficiency under zero magnetic field is a key requirement. The Josephson junction constitutes a versatile SDE platform for exploiting quantum materials that exhibit ferromagnetism, topology, or unconventional superconductivity. However, a single two-dimensional material system that inherently offers these properties and allows for precise interface engineering, such as twisting, remains elusive. Here we report a record-high, field-free diode efficiency of ~30% in twist van der Waals Josephson heterostructures of the sign-change iron-chalcogenide superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 and the conventional transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor 2H-NbSe2. The diode response shows a striking twist-angle dependence: the efficiency peaks at crystallographic alignment and collapses with a small misorientation of ~7 deg. Importantly, the twist-angle evolution of superconducting interference measurements reveals that efficient nonreciprocity arises from asymmetric edge supercurrents, whereas bulk transport suppresses the effect. These findings establish edge states as the driving mechanism of the unconventional SDE, linking it to exotic pairing and topology in multiband iron-based superconductors. Our findings reveal intricate physics involving novel pairing symmetry, magnetism, and topology in the multiband iron-based superconductor, and offer a new route to high-performance superconducting diodes.</p>

            <p>Strong-field terahertz (THz) excitations enable dynamic control over electronic, lattice and symmetry degrees of freedom in quantum materials. Here, we uncover pronounced terahertz-induced symmetry modulations and coherent phonon dynamics in the van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS3, in which inversion symmetry is broken by its antiferromagnetic spin configuration. Time-resolved second harmonic generation measurements reveal long-lived giant oscillations in the antiferromagnetic phase, with amplitudes comparable to the equilibrium signal, driven by phonons involving percent-level atomic displacements relative to the equilibrium bond lengths. The temporal evolution of the rotational anisotropy patterns indicate a dynamic breaking of mirror symmetry, modulated by two vibrational modes at 1.7 THz and 4.5 THz, with the former corresponding to a hidden mode not observed in equilibrium spectroscopy. We show that these effects arise in part from a field-induced charge rearrangement mechanism that lowers the local crystal symmetry, and couples to the phonon modes. A long-lived field-driven response was uncovered with a complex THz polarization dependence which, in comparison to theory, indicates evidence for an antiferromagnetic-to-ferrimagnetic transition. Our results establish an effective field-tunable pathway for driving excitations otherwise weak in equilibrium, and for manipulating magnetism in low-dimensional materials via dynamical modulation of symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of Stoner Ferromagnetism by Intrinsic Altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Lu, Chao Cao, Huiqiu Yuan, Piers Coleman, Lun-Hui Hu</p>
            <p>The Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism arises from interaction-driven asymmetric filling of spin bands, requiring that the spin susceptibility: (i) peaks dominantly at $\mathbf{Q}=\bm{0}$; and (ii) diverges at a critical interaction strength. Here, we demonstrate that this Stoner mechanism breaks down due to competition with altermagnetic orders, even when both conditions are met. Altermagnetism in solids is characterized by collinear antiparallel spin alignment that preserves translational symmetry, and inherently fulfills these requirements. As a proof of concept, we study a two-orbital Hubbard model with electron filling near Van Hove singularities at high-symmetry momenta. Our results reveal that orbital-resolved spin fluctuations, amplified by strong inter-orbital hopping, stabilize intrinsic altermagnetic order. A quantum phase transition from altermagnetism to ferromagnetism occurs at critical Hund's coupling $J_H$. We further propose directional spin conductivity anisotropy as a detectable signature of this transition via non-local spin transport. This work establishes the pivotal role of altermagnetism in correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Active particles affect their environment as much as the environment affects their active motion. Here, we present an experimental system where both can be simultaneously adjusted in situ using an external AC electric field. The environment consists in a two-dimensional bath of colloidal silica particles, whereas the active particles are gold-coated Janus spheres. As the electric field orthogonal to the planar layer increases, the former become stiffer and the latter become faster. The active motion evolves from a viscous like to a viscoelastic like behavior, with the reorientation frequency increasing with the particle speed. This effect culminates in the spontaneous chiralization of particle trajectories. We demonstrate that self-sustained reorientations arise from local compressions and in- teraction asymmetries, revealing a general particle-level mechanism where changes in the mechanical properties of the environment reshape active trajectories.</p>

As the impurity-bath coupling increases, the excited states change from distinct soliton configurations to hybridized soliton-polaron states, eventually crossing over from repulsive to attractive polarons at unitarity. We identify a universal regime near this crossover where the polaron properties are accurately characterized by the zero-energy scattering length.</p>

            <p>Unveiling the interplay between spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW) orders in correlated electron materials is important to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their electronic, structural, and magnetic properties. Kagome lattice materials are interesting because their flat electronic bands, Dirac points, and van Hove singularities can enable a variety of exotic electronic and magnetic phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe, which exhibits a CDW order deep within an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, was found to respond dramatically to post-growth annealing - with the ability to tune the CDW repeatedly from long-range order to no (or extremely weak) order. Additionally, neutron scattering studies suggest that incommensurate magnetic peaks that onsets at $T_{Canting}$ = $T_{SDW} \approx$ 60 K in the system arise from a SDW order instead of the AFM double cone structure. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to show two distinct spin excitations exist below $T_{Canting}$ corresponding to two coexisting magnetic orders in the system in both sets of annealed samples with and without CDW. While CDW order or no order can dramatically affect the onset temperature of $T_{Canting}$ and elastic incommensurate magnetic scattering, its impact on low-energy spin fluctuations is more limited. In both samples, a pair of gapless incommensurate spin excitations arising from the SDW order wavevector coexist with gapped commensurate spin waves from the A-type AFM order across $T_{Canting}$. Low-energy spin excitations for both samples couple dynamically to the lattice through enhanced magnetic scattering intensity on cooling below $T_{CDW}$, regardless the status of the static long-range CDW order. The incommensurate SDW order in the long-range CDW ordered sample also induces a tiny in-plane lattice distortion of the kagome lattice that is absent in the no CDW ordered sample.</p>

            <h2>Depinning of KPZ Interfaces in Fractional Brownian Landscapes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neda Valizadeh, Morteza Nattagh Najafi</p>
            <p>We explore the critical dynamics of driven interfaces propagating through a two dimensional disordered medium with long range spatial correlations, modeled using fractional Brownian motion. Departing from conventional models with uncorrelated disorder, we introduce quenched noise fields characterized by a tunable Hurst exponent H, allowing systematic control over the spatial structure of the background medium. The interface evolution is governed by a quenched Kardar Parisi Zhang equation modified to account for correlated disorder, namely QKPZ. Through analytical scaling analysis, we uncover how the presence of long-range correlations reshapes the depinning transition, alters the critical force Fc, and gives rise to a family of critical exponents that depend continuously on H. Our findings reveal a rich interplay between disorder correlations and the non-linearity term in QKPZ, leading to a breakdown of conventional universality and the emergence of nontrivial scaling behaviors. The exponents are found to change by H in the anticorrelation regime, while they are nearly constant in the correlation regime, suggesting a super-universal behavior for the latter. By a comparison with the quenched Edwards Wilkinson model, we study the effect of the non linearity term in the QKPZ model. This work provides new insights into the physics of driven systems in complex environments and paves the way for understanding transport in correlated disordered media.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nigora Turaeva, Boris Oksengendler, Farida Iskandarova</p>
            <p>The Coulomb explosion is a process that occurs following the formation of multiple charges during Auger cascades, leading to the destruction of solid-state and molecular structures. For unstable multi-charged ions produced at Auger cascades, the destruction cross-section is directly related to the probability of Coulomb explosion, which depends on characteristic times of ion dissociation and electron neutralization. This study demonstrates that the atomic dissociation time decreases with charge. An expression for the neutralization time was obtained within the model, in which the probability of Coulomb explosion is considered as a competition of two processes, ion dissociation and electron neutralization. By using approximation of the effective mass, it was shown that the neutralization time is a function of the effective mass and the width of the valence band of solid states.</p>

Applications dependent on electrical properties such as solar cells, photodetectors, and transistors have fallen short of their full potential because of poor control over electrical properties, and some of applications with the most promise for novelty, such as a solid-state quantum simulator for quantum computation and spintronics, are stagnant. Lack of clarity on the charge transport mechanism has been a significant barrier to progress, particularly as numerous sources of disorder are present. In this work, we make advancements in a nano-patterning technique to fabricate a 70-nm wide QD solid that is also free of several sources of structural defects. Owing to the small size and structural integrity, we isolate the charge dynamics of a single conductance channel within a percolation network. We tune parameters to measure ~10 channels, and with a time-resolved measurement, we find conductance noise that exceeds 100% of the average current. From observation of the long-time dynamics of the charge transport, including random telegraph noise, colored noise and attractor states, we model the transport with stochastic quasi-one-dimensional percolation paths. With this insight into the charge transport of QD solids unimpeded by structural defects, we provide a path for the rational design of a QD solid with electrical properties that reflect the underlying tunable, periodic potential.</p>

            <h2>Phase Transitions and Noise Robustness of Quantum Graph States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tatsuya Numajiri, Shion Yamashika, Tomonori Tanizawa, Ryosuke Yoshii, Yuki Takeuchi, Shunji Tsuchiya</p>
            <p>Graph states are entangled states that are essential for quantum information processing, including measurement-based quantum computation. As experimental advances enable the realization of large-scale graph states, efficient fidelity estimation methods are crucial for assessing their robustness against noise. However, calculations of exact fidelity become intractable for large systems due to the exponential growth in the number of stabilizers. In this work, we show that the fidelity between any ideal graph state and its noisy counterpart under IID Pauli noise can be mapped to the partition function of a classical spin system, enabling efficient computation via statistical mechanical techniques, including transfer matrix methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Using this approach, we analyze the fidelity for regular graph states under depolarizing noise and uncover the emergence of phase transitions in fidelity between the pure-state regime and the noise-dominated regime governed by both the connectivity (degree) and spatial dimensionality of the graph state. Specifically, in 2D, phase transitions occur only when the degree satisfies $d\ge 6$, while in 3D they already appear at $d\ge 5$. However, for graph states with excessively high degree, such as fully connected graphs, the phase transition disappears, suggesting that extreme connectivity suppresses critical behavior. These findings reveal that robustness of graph states against noise is determined by their connectivity and spatial dimensionality. Graph states with lower degree and/or dimensionality, which exhibit a smooth crossover rather than a sharp transition, demonstrate greater robustness, while highly connected or higher-dimensional graph states are more fragile. Extreme connectivity, as the fully connected graph state possesses, restores robustness.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Distillation of Magic States via Composite Schemes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Erew, Moshe Goldstein, Yaron Oz, Haim Suchowski</p>
            <p>Magic state distillation (MSD) is a cornerstone of fault-tolerant quantum computing, enabling non-Clifford gates via state injection into stabilizer circuits. However, the substantial overhead of current MSD protocols remains a major obstacle to scalable implementations. We propose a general framework for pre-distillation, based on composite pulse sequences that suppress systematic errors in the generation of magic states. Unlike typical composite designs that target simple gates such as $X$, $Z$, or Hadamard, our schemes directly implement the non-Clifford $\mathcal{T}$ gate with enhanced robustness. We develop composite sequences tailored to the dominant control imperfections in superconducting, trapped-ion, neutral-atom, and integrated photonic platforms. To quantify improvement in the implementation, we introduce an operationally motivated fidelity measure specifically tailored to the $\mathcal{T}$ gate: the T-magic error, which captures the gate's effectiveness in preparing high-fidelity magic states. We further show that the error in the channel arising from the injection of faulty magic states scales linearly with the leading-order error of the states. Across all platforms, our approach yields high-fidelity $\mathcal{T}$ gates with reduced noise, lowering the number of distillation levels by up to three. This translates to exponential savings in qubit overhead and offers a practical path toward more resource-efficient universal quantum computation.</p>

            <p>We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the number of particles. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix to the projection onto the normalized order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</p>

            <h2>Sequential Bayesian Inference of the GTN Damage Model Using Multimodal Experimental Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ali Seyed Mahmoud, Dominic Renner, Ali Khosravani, Surya R. Kalidindi</p>
            <p>Reliable parameter identification in ductile damage models remains challenging because the salient physics of damage progression are localized to small regions in material responses, and their signatures are often diluted in specimen-level measurements. Here, we propose a sequential Bayesian Inference (BI) framework for the calibration of the Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman (GTN) model using multimodal experimental data (i.e., the specimen-level force-displacement (F-D) measurements and the spatially resolved digital image correlation (DIC) strain fields). This calibration approach builds on a previously developed two-step BI framework that first establishes a low-computational-cost emulator for a physics-based simulator (here, a finite element model incorporating the GTN material model) and then uses the experimental data to sample posteriors for the material model parameters using the Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (T-MCMC). A central challenge to the successful application of this BI framework to the present problem arises from the high-dimensional representations needed to capture the salient features embedded in the F-D curves and the DIC fields. In this paper, it is demonstrated that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provides low-dimensional representations that make it possible to apply the BI framework to the problem. Most importantly, it is shown that the sequence in which the BI is applied has a dramatic influence on the results obtained. Specifically, it is observed that applying BI first on F-D curves and subsequently on the DIC fields produces improved estimates of the GTN parameters. Possible causes for these observations are discussed in this paper, using AA6111 aluminum alloy as a case study.</p>

            <p>The precise modulation of activity through inhibitory signals ensures that both insect colonies and neural circuits operate efficiently and adaptively, highlighting the fundamental importance of inhibition in biological systems. Modulatory signals are produced in various contexts and are known for subtly shifting the probability of receiver behaviors based on response thresholds. Here we propose a non-linear function to introduce inhibitory responsiveness in collective decision-making inspired by honeybee house-hunting. We show that, compared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final consensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based tasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might outweigh this drawback.</p>

            <p>The resistance of a heavy metal can be modulated by an adjacent magnetic material through the combined effects of the spin Hall effect, inverse spin Hall effect, and dissipation of the spin accumulation at the interface. This phenomenon is known as the spin Hall magnetoresistance. The dissipation of the spin accumulation can occur via various mechanisms, with spin-transfer torque being the most extensively studied. In this work, we report the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance at the interface between platinum and an insulating altermagnetic candidate, Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$. Our findings reveal that this heterostructure exhibits a relatively large spin Hall magnetoresistance signal, which is anisotropic with respect to the crystal orientation of the current channel. We explore and rule out several potential explanations for this anisotropy and propose that our results may be understood in the context of the anisotropies of the spin current channels across the Pt/altermagnetic Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$ interface.</p>

            <p>Applying angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we present compelling spectroscopic evidence demonstrating the intertwining and mutual interaction between the Kondo and kagome sublattices in heavy-fermion intermetallic compound YbV$_6$Sn$_6$. We reveal the Yb 4$f$-derived states near the Fermi level, along with the presence of bulk kagome bands and topological surface states. We unveil strong interactions between the 4$f$ and itinerant electrons, where the kagome bands hosting the Dirac fermions and van Hove singularities predominate. Such findings are well described using a $c$-$f$ hybridization model. On the other hand, our systematic characterization of magnetic properties demonstrates an unusually enhanced antiferromagnetic ordering, where the kagome-derived van Hove singularities near $E_F$ play a vital role in determining the unconventional nature of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction and Kondo coupling. These unique kagome-state-mediated exchange interactions have never been reported before and could lead to a novel phase diagram and various quantum critical behaviors in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and its siblings. Our results not only expand the family of exotic quantum phases entangled with kagome structure to the strongly correlated regime, but also establish YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ as an unprecedented platform to explore unconventional many-body physics beyond the standard Kondo picture.</p>

            <p>Polar metals are an underexplored material class combining two properties that are typically incompatible, namely a polar crystal structure and reasonable electrical conductivity. While intriguing given that metals favor centrosymmetry, these materials also exhibit potential functional properties relevant to memory, optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications. The distortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a centrosymmetry-lifting phase transformation into a polar crystal structure. In the process, domains with uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain boundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in "charged" head-to-head (H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM microstructures have been studied. Here we reveal in the intermetallic DPM Mn5Al8 different chemical reactivity and surface interactions at domain boundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character. Variable surface electron-transfer reactivity suggests localized changes in electronic work functions due to an increase (H-H) or depletion (T-T) in the electronic density of states. This behavior is unintuitive in a metal where electrostatic de-polarizing fields should not account for fluctuations in carrier densities. These findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain boundary behavior and deserve increased attention. Metallic DPMs allow highly tunable chemistries that can undergo various thermomechanical processing and transformation protocols. Ultimately, this study marks a milestone in metal physics and uncovers novel intermetallic properties, propelling the discovery and design of advanced electronic materials and devices.</p>

            <p>Oxide Li-conducting solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer excellent chemical and thermal stability but typically exhibit lower ionic conductivity than sulfides and chlorides. This motivates the search for new oxide materials with enhanced conductivity. Crystal structure prediction is a powerful approach for identifying such candidates. However, the structural complexity of oxide SSEs, often involving unit cells with more than 100 atoms, presents significant challenges for conventional methods. In this study, we introduce TOPIC, a structure prediction algorithm that reduces configurational complexity by enforcing corner-sharing (CS) bond topology constraints. We demonstrate that TOPIC successfully reproduces the ground-state and metastable structures of known oxide SSEs, including LiTa$_2$PO$_8$ and Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$, which contain up to about 200 atoms per unit cell. By combining this approach with a pretrained machine-learning interatomic potential, we systematically screen quaternary oxide compositions and identify 92 promising candidates with CS frameworks. In particular, Li$_4$Hf$_2$Si$_3$O$_{12}$, which corresponds to the ground state at its composition, exhibits an ionic conductivity of 14 mS cm$^{-1}$, a hull energy of 21 meV atom$^{-1}$, and a band gap of 6.5 eV. Through our investigation, we identify the Li ratio as one of the key factors determining the stability of CS structures. Overall, our approach provides a practical and scalable pathway for discovering high-performance oxide solid electrolytes in previously unexplored chemical spaces.</p>

            <p>Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels, ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular, sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by ultralow torque noise.</p>

In the present work we consider the metal-insulator transition in the model case of a 1D CuO chain in the regime of half-filling of the band.

            <p>We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</p>

            <p>Conventional metals, insulators, and semimetals are constrained by fundamental limitations in terms of their thermoelectric performance. Topological materials offer certain features that allow them to circumvent these constraints, and potentially to form the basis for thermoelectric devices with unprecedented efficiency. In this article we review the thermoelectric performance of topological materials, focusing specifically on nodal semimetals, such as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. We discuss how certain unique ``topological'' features of these materials -- namely their topologically protected band touching points, electron-hole degenerate lowest Landau level, and Berry curvature -- allow them to exhibit thermoelectric properties that go beyond what is possible in conventional materials, particularly in the presence of an applied magnetic field. We focus our discussion on the goal of achieving large figure of merit $zT$, and for each material class we summarize optimal \emph{design principles} for selecting materials that maximize thermoelectric efficiency. We then use these optimal design principles to design and implement a high-throughput database search for topological semimetals that are promising as thermoelectrics. In addition to highlighting a number of materials that are already known to have large magnetothermoelectric effects, our search uncovers twelve additional materials that are especially promising for near-future experiments.</p>

            <p>Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</p>

            <h2>Spin and Orbital Edelstein effect in gated monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tapesh Gautam, S. Satpathy</p>
            <p>The Edelstein effect consists of the non-equilibrium accumulation of magnetization in response to an applied electric field in systems with broken inversion symmetry. While the spin Edelstein effect (SEE), originating from spin moments, is well established, its orbital counterpart, where magnetization arises from orbital moment, has only recently begun to attract attention. In this work, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) in gated monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, by using first-principles density-functional calculations with both electron and hole doping. The gate-induced broken mirror symmetry produces a Rashba-type chiral spin/orbital angular momentum texture, which in turn leads to the Edelstein effect in response to an applied in-plane electric field. We find that for electron doping the Edelstein response is dominated by the orbital channel, whereas for hole doping the orbital and spin contributions are comparable. For the case of hole doping, both OEE and SEE are strongly enhanced by a small amount of strain, due to strain-driven shifts between the Gamma and K/K' valley energies. We derive analytical expressions for the spin and orbital Edelstein susceptibilities and evaluate their magnitudes from first-principles. Remarkably, the predicted OEE in gated monolayer TMDs is an order of magnitude larger than values reported in previously studied systems. Our results identify TMDs as promising platforms for studying the orbital Edelstein effect and highlight their potential applications in spintronics devices.</p>

            <p>The orbital degree of freedom has recently attracted significant attention due to the novel phenomena it enables in condensed matter systems. However, the interpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles remains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of orbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons and phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in bosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion of the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the latter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional antiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum geometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking, yielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM. We propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage generated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the bosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the emerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge between phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding magnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital degrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical control of magnetization and phononic transport.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yaqing Yang, Zhen Zhang, Liwen Zhang, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia, Jun Chen, Lei Zhang</p>
            <p>The electrical control of pure spin current remains a central challenge in spintronics, particularly in time-reversal symmetric systems composed of nonmagnetic elements, where spin and electric fields interact only indirectly. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for electrically tuning pure spin photocurrent in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry via a gate electric field. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in systems with spin-orbit coupling and in-plane mirror symmetry, an out-of-plane electric field induces spin splitting and reversal in the band structure near the Fermi energy, enabling magnitude control and direction reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. To validate this mechanism, we perform first-principles calculations on germanene, an experimentally realized two-dimensional material. Beyond amplitude modulation, we reveal that reversing the direction of the applied electric field leads to a corresponding reversal of the pure spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we show that the pure spin photocurrent can be tuned by varying the photon energy and the incident angle of light, providing additional degrees of control over spin transport. These findings establish a robust strategy for electric-field-controlled pure spin transport in two-dimensional materials, offering new possibilities for the development of optospintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model and XXZ model with the staggered imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization, respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity, mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably, the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime of the XXZ model.</p>

Using classical-field (truncated-Wigner) simulations together with a Bogoliubov stability analysis, we show that the dark-state nature of the soliton suppresses fluctuations and shifts the critical point relative to the comparable phenomenon of optical bistability in driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. We then demonstrate that this mechanism quantitatively captures the bistability phase boundary observed in the experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 235302 (2016)], resolving substantial discrepancies in prior modeling efforts. Our results reveal how driving, dissipation and quantum coherence can interact to induce nonequilibrium phase transitions in ultra-cold atomic gases.</p>

            <h2>Observation of non-Hermitian topology in cold Rydberg quantum gases</h2>

            <p>The pursuit of topological phenomena in non-Hermitian systems has unveiled new physics beyond the conventional Hermitian paradigm, yet their realization in interacting many-body platforms remains a critical challenge. Exploring this interplay is essential to understand how strong interactions and dissipation collectively shape topological phases in open quantum systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-Hermitian spectra topology in a dissipative Rydberg atomic gas and characterize parameters-dependent winding numbers. By increasing the interaction strength, the system evolves from Hermitian to non-Hermitian regime, accompanying emergence of trajectory loop in the complex energy plane. As the scanning time is varied, the spectra topology becomes twisted in the complex energy plane manifesting as a topology phase transition with the sign winding number changed. When preparing the system in different initial states, we can access a nontrivial fractional phase within a parameter space that globally possesses an integer winding. Furthermore, by changing the scanning direction, we observe the differentiated loops, revealing the breaking of chirality symmetry. This work establishes cold Rydberg gases as a versatile platform for exploring the rich interplay between non-Hermitian topology, strong interactions, and dissipative quantum dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Half-filled metal and molecular-orbital-mediated pairing in cuprate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sixuan Chen, Zhiheng Yao, Ning Xia, Shusen Ye, Hongrui Zhang, Jianfa Zhao, Qingqing Liu, Changqing Jin, Shuo Yang, Yayu Wang</p>
            <p>The cuprates exhibit anomalous momentum-space structure with antinodal gap and nodal arc in the underdoped regime, which evolves into a complete hole-type Fermi surface with a large Luttinger volume in the overdoped regime. The real-space electronic structure is also quite complex, as characterized by microscopic inhomogeneities and intertwined density wave orders. Here we show that doped holes in cuprate form localized electronic molecules consisting of 4a0 plaquettes, and each plaquette contains approximately two holes. The effective local doping level is thus around 1/8, which is sufficient to destroy the underlying AF order and more importantly, recovers the half-filled metallic state of the original CuO2 plane. The restored Fermi surface, hosting one hole per unit cell, is consistent with experimental results and satisfies the Luttinger theorem. We then construct the momentum-space structure of the half-filled metal by considering the real-space configuration of electronic molecules. We show that the electronic potential with 4a0 periodicity imposed by the plaquettes and the quantum size effect of electronic molecules obliterate the nested antinodal Fermi surface sheets, leaving behind short arcs with coherent quasiparticles around the node. We propose that two doped holes in each plaquette occupy the shared molecular orbital and form a spin singlet, which can mediate the pairing of itinerant holes on the remnant Fermi surface of the half-filled metal. The electric dipole moment between the molecular orbitals and the dopant ions may also provide a novel attractive interaction between itinerant holes. This phenomenological model for pair formation between itinerant holes on the half-filled Fermi surface mediated by localized molecular orbitals resolves several core issues concerning the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anzumaan R. Chakraborty, Fan Yang, Turan Birol, Rafael M. Fernandes</p>
            <p>Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity has been demonstrated in the family of multi-layered nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Key questions remain open regarding the low-energy electronic states that support superconductivity in these compounds. Here we take advantage of the natural polymorphism between bilayer (2222) and alternating monolayer-trilayer (1313) stacking sequences that arises in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ crystals, and by employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we identify a universal low-energy electronic structure in this family of materials. We observe the fingerprint of a doping-dependent spin-density wave (SDW) instability -- strong and coherent enough to reconstruct the Fermi surface, both by gapping out regions of the low-energy electronic structure as well as translating the $\beta$ pocket by a vector $Q_{t\beta}$ consistent with the results of previous neutron and x-ray scattering experiments. Using an effective tight-binding model, we simulate the spectral weight distribution observed in our ARPES dichroism experiments and establish that the low-energy electronic phenomenology is dominated by oxygen-centered planar orbitals, which evolve from the $d_{3x^2-r^2}$ and $d_{3y^2-r^2}$ symmetry characteristic of 3-spin polarons (3SP) to the familiar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Zhang-Rice singlets (ZRS) that support high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. By inclusion of magnetic moments on plaquettes of oxygen orbitals in our model, we show that ZRS-like states mediate the SDW. Combined with the observation that oxygen annealing is required to induce superconductivity in both thin films and bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, this demonstrates that the ZRS population dictates whether the ground state favors density-wave order or superconductivity -- with hole doping suppressing the former and stabilizing the latter, as in the cuprates.</p>

            <p>Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and periodic confinement, moiré excitons provide a fertile territory for realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids, potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities, moiré excitons hybridize with photons to form moiré exciton-polaritons, a new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and novel topological features. In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental progress in the field of moiré excitons and polaritons. We begin by introducing the formation mechanisms of moiré patterns in two-dimensional semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moiré polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems, moiré excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation, optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the interaction between interlayer excitons and ferroelectric domains in hBN-encapsulated 3R-MoS$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterostructures, combining photoluminescence experiments with density functional theory and many-body Green's function calculations. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals a strong redshift of the interlayer exciton energy with increasing MoS$_2$ layer thickness, attributed to band renormalization and dielectric effects. We observe local variations in exciton energy that correlate with local ferroelectric domain polarization of the 3R-MoS$_2$ layer, showcasing distinct domain-dependent interlayer exciton transition energies. Gate voltage experiments demonstrate that the interlayer exciton energy can be tuned by electrically induced domain switching. These results highlight the potential for interlayer exciton control by local ferroelectric order and establish a foundation for future ferroelectric optoelectronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Mameda, Naoki Yamamoto</p>
            <p>Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</p>

            <p>Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have long been recognized as promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity by intercalation or charge doping, yet experimental progress has stalled with transition temperatures (Tc) limited to 11.5 K at ambient pressure and 15.1 K at 7.5 GPa in calcium-intercalated graphite over decades. Here, we report robust superconductivity in sodium-intercalated graphite with Tc of 22.3 K, as demonstrated by clear zero-resistance behavior. Our approach involves simply room-temperature grinding of graphite with sodium, followed by slight compression up to 7.1 GPa, circumventing complex synthesis procedures. Through synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with first-principles calculations, we identify the major superconducting phase as an orthorhombic stage-2 GIC structure with slightly over-stoichiometric composition (Na1+xC8). Electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that superconductivity primarily emerges from the interactions between out-of-plane carbon electrons and low-frequency Na/C this http URL enhancement in Tc establishes sodium as superior for achieving higher-Tc in GICs and illustrates promising pathway for further optimization through compositional and structural tuning.</p>

            <h2>Splitting of electronic spectrum in paramagnetic phase of itinerant ferromagnets and altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. A. Katanin</p>
            <p>We study self-energy effects, induced by strong magnetic fluctuations in paramagnetic phase of strongly-correlated itinerant magnets within the density functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT approach) and its non-local extension. As concrete examples, we consider $\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase and suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Superconducting diodes, similar to semiconductor diodes, possess unidirectional superconducting properties and are the fundamental units for constructing superconducting quantum computing, thus attracting widespread attention. At present, most of superconducting diodes require an external magnetic field or proximity effect to break time reversal symmetry (TRS). The cases of intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) under zero magnetic field are relatively scarce, and there are still some puzzles especially regarding the reasons for the TRS breaking. Here, we not only report field free SDE in NbSe2 induced by strain, but also large values of the difference of Ic+ and |Ic-| ({\Delta}Ic) of 286 {\mu}A and the superconducting diode efficiency ({\eta}) of 6.76 % are achieved. Interestingly, {\Delta}Ic varies with the magnetic field and exhibits two distinct evolutionary behaviors with B-odd or B-even symmetry in various devices. We attribute this to the selective activation of two independent, spatially-orthogonal mechanisms: a stress-induced real-space polarity and a field-induced reciprocal-space asymmetric energy bands. In general, we propose an extremely effectively method to produce field free SDE, even when the material itself does not possess field free SDE, and provide new perspectives to understand the SDE which build new avenues for superconducting quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We report magnetoelectric coupling in nanoparticle assemblies that persists to temperatures over 300 times lower than in previous studies. The ME response saturates at low temperature, revealing a quantum plateau of the coupling. A field dependence analysis shows a crossover from quadratic to linear behavior, captured by a phenomenological expansion $C(B,T) \simeq C_0(T) + a_1(T) B + a_2(T) B^2$. The magnitude of the extracted quadratic coefficient, $|a_2(T)|$, follows a power law $|a_2(T)| \sim T^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.15$, indicating proximity to a quantum critical regime. The observed saturation reflects a new intrinsic energy scale, distinct from finite-size or extrinsic effects. These results establish nanoparticle assemblies as a new platform for studying quantum magnetoelectric phenomena.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonghyun Hwang, Howard A. Stone</p>
            <p>The subject of viscoelastic flow phenomena is crucial to many areas of engineering and the physical sciences. Although much of our understanding of viscoelastic flow features stem from carefully designed experiments, preparation of model viscoelastic fluids remains an outstanding challenge; for example, fabricating a series of fluids with varied fluid shear moduli $G_0$, but with an identical relaxation time $\tau$, is nontrivial. In this work, we harness the non-ideality of nearly constant-viscosity elastic fluids (commonly known as `Boger fluids') made with polyisobutylene to develop an experimental methodology that produces a set of fluids with desired viscoelastic properties, specifically, $G_0$, $\tau$, and the first normal stress difference coefficient $\psi_1$. Through a simple linear algebraic manipulation between the rheological properties of interest ($G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$) and the fluid compositions in terms of polymer concentration $c$, molecular weight $M_w$, and solvent viscosity $\eta_s$, we developed a `design equation' that takes $G_0$, $\tau$, $\psi_1$ as inputs and calculates values for $c$, $M_w$, $\eta_s$ as outputs. Using this method, fabrication of sample viscoelastic fluids whose rheological properties are \textit{a priori} known can be achieved.</p>

            <p>Chiral-lattice degrees of freedom can offer novel chirality-selective functionalities for thermotronic applications. Chiral phonons, carrying both heat and angular momentum, can emerge through a breaking of chiral degeneracy in the phonon bands, either via an intrinsic chiral crystal structure or by angular momentum transfer from photons or spins. This chiral controllability of the lattice dynamics enables a design of chiral thermo-devices by integrating ferromagnets with chiral materials. Here, we present a nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch realized using a simple heterostructure composed of ferromagnetic [Co/Pt] multilayers and insulating chiral $\alpha$-SiO2, where an external magnetic field can control thermal transport properties. Our experimental results based on the magneto-optic thermometry reveal that the thermal conductivity of $\alpha$-SiO2 exhibits a clear dependence on both the magnetization direction of [Co/Pt] multilayers and the structural chirality of $\alpha$-SiO2, which is supported well by the first-principles-based molecular dynamic simulations. The magnetization-dependent thermal on/off ratio amounts to 1.07 at room temperature and increases to about 1.2 as temperature decreases to 50 K, due to a reduction of Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering rate in $\alpha$-SiO2. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration of the nanoscale chirality-selective thermal switch based on the ferromagnetic/chiral material heterostructure, highlighting its potential as a key technology for addressing heat dissipation challenges in nanoscale electronic devices.</p>

            <p>Solid-melt interfaces play a pivotal role in governing crystal growth and metal-mediated epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) and other semiconductor materials. Using atomistic simulations based on machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we uncover that multiple layers of Ga atoms at the GaN-Ga melt interface form structurally ordered and electronically charged configurations that are critical for the growth kinetics of GaN. These ordered layers modulate the free energy landscape (FEL) for N adsorption and substantially reduce the migration barriers for N at the interface compared to a clean GaN surface. Leveraging these interfacial energetics, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations reveal that GaN growth follows a diffusion-controlled, layer-by-layer mechanism, with the FEL for N adsorption emerging as the rate-limiting factor. By incorporating facet-specific FELs and the diffusivity/solubility of N in Ga melt, we develop a predictive, fitting-free transport model that estimates facet-dependent growth rates in the range of ~0.01 to 0.04 nm/s, in agreement with experimental growth rates observed in GaN nanoparticles synthesized by Ga-mediated molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). This multiscale framework offers a generalizable and quantitative approach to link atomic-scale ordering and interfacial energetics to macroscopic phenomena, providing actionable insights for the rational design of metal-mediated epitaxial processes.</p>

The electrical resistance exhibits a characteristic logarithmic temperature dependence in this phase, $\rho \sim \ln(1/T)$. Through $\beta$-function scaling analysis, we observed "vertical flow" indicating unconventional scaling behavior associated with localized bosonic states. Our results suggest the existence of bosons-Cooper pairs-persisting up to high temperatures around 220 K and that these bosons undergo weak localization. In the Bose glass phase, vortices are found to have a dual relationship with the localized Cooper pairs, enabling their motion and resulting in finite resistance despite the presence of bosonic order. We identified two quantum critical points: one between the Bose glass and superconducting phases and another between the Bose glass and Mott insulating phases, allowing us to extract the corresponding quantum sheet resistances. We revealed that the ground state of the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ changes depending on the localization strength. Thinning the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ corresponds to controlling the electronic correlation by relieving the distortion in RuO$_6$ octahedra. These findings offer significant insights into the interplay between electronic correlations and bosonic transport, with important implications for studying high-temperature superconductors based on perovskite structures.</p>

            <h2>High-Precision Temperature Estimation Based on Magnetic Nanoparticles Dominated by Brownian Relaxation under Combined AC and DC Magnetic Fields</h2>

            <p>Brownian relaxation is one of the primary mechanisms that allows magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to convert magnetic energy into thermal energy under an excitation magnetic field. Accurately characterizing the MNPs' magnetization dynamics dominated by Brownian relaxation is crucial for achieving high-precision temperature estimation. However, the lack of a readily applicable analytical expression remains a major obstacle to the advancement of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNPH). In this paper, the perturbation method was applied to derive analytical expressions from the Fokker-Planck equation, which characterized MNPs' magnetization behaviors under the AC and DC magnetic fields. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the accuracy of the analytical expressions and to explore the correlation between temperature and the magnetization response. Then, a temperature analysis model based on magnetization harmonics was constructed. The first and second harmonic ratios and first harmonic phase were used to calculate MNPs' temperature, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that within 310 K to 320 K, the estimation error of the temperature using the amplitude ratio of the first to second harmonics is below 0.0151 K, while the error using the first harmonic phase is below 0.0218 K. The derived analytical expressions are expected to enhance the accuracy of MNP-based temperature measurements and facilitate their broader applications in MNPH and MNP imaging.</p>

            <h2>Strong enhancement of d-wave superconductivity in an extended checkerboard Hubbard ladder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xichen Huang, Saisai He, Jize Zhao, Zhong-Bing Huang</p>
            <p>By employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we study an extended checkerboard Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder, which includes an intraplaquette nearest-neighbour attraction V. The simulated results show that V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical |Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4 symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'<0.2t, the system transits to the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle excitations from gapless to gapped type.</p>

We study spin-stripe order in the square lattice Hubbard model as a function of doping and temperature, by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equa- tion with the local vertex from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), both inside and outside the antiferromagnetic phase. We find broad regions of horizontal/vertical spin stripes at low tempera- tures for the model with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping. Their wavelength depends on hole doping in a nonlinear fashion, and is highly sensitive to the ratio of nearest and next-nearest neighbor hoppings.</p>

            <h2>High-energy electron-beam induced defect engineering of monolayer MoS2 for tunable optical properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anagha Gopinath, Faiha Mujeeb, Subhabrata Dhar, Jyoti Mohanty</p>
            <p>Structural defects in 2D-transition metal dichalcogenides are critical in modulating their optical and electrical behavior. Nevertheless, precise defect control within the monolayer regime poses a significant challenge. Herein, a high-energy (1MeV) electron beam irradiation strategy is harnessed to induce defects in monolayer MoS2. Controlled variation of electron-beam irradiation time tunes the defect density, as reflected by the evolution of defect-mediated photoluminescence characteristics. The optically active defect emission appearing at approx. 200-300meV below the A exciton at 85K exhibits a systematic increase in intensity with prolonged exposure and saturates at higher laser excitation power. Circular polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals strong suppression of valley polarization of the A exciton after irradiation. Complementary x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies enhanced Mo-O bonding signatures in MoS2 following irradiation. Kelvin probe force microscopy indicates the transition to p-type doping behaviour. A detailed temperature and power-dependent photoluminescence measurements further elucidate the optical behaviour of these defect states. Density functional theory calculations using these configurations establish that the transition between the conduction band and acceptor states within the bandgap accounts for the defect emission. This work presents a tunable route for defect engineering in monolayer TMDs, enabling controlled tailoring of their structural and optical properties for optoelectronic, electronic and valleytronic applications.</p>

            <p>Interfaces between materials or phases -- whether in condensed matter systems, biological membranes, or catalytic surfaces -- are rich with phenomena that are fundamentally distinct from those present in the bulk. In some cases, interfaces host quasiparticles, such as surface plasmons or Majorana fermions, which can significantly influence the material properties. Here, we investigate a unique 1D interface formed between two monolayer 2D semiconductors, MoSe2, and WSe2, and unambiguously observe a new type of excitonic quasiparticle that resides exclusively at the boundary. Our optical measurements reveal several remarkable properties of this interfacial exciton. First, it possesses an in-plane dipole moment with exceptionally large dipole lengths of 2nm. The emission spectrum reveals narrow discrete states, indicating strong quantum confinement of the center-of-mass motion across the interface. Power-dependent measurements show a sublinear saturation behavior, reflecting interactions between dipolar excitons in this low-dimensional system. Moreover, the exciton displays striking sensitivity to charge carriers due to its dipolar character. Our results introduce a new platform for exploring interacting 1D dipolar bosonic systems with unique quantum properties and open pathways for novel optoelectronic devices, including applications in nonlinear quantum photonics.</p>

            <p>The organic conductor $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ provides the prime example of a charge-order-driven metal-insulator transition. Restricted chemical substitution of S atoms by Se in the constituent molecules allows us to modify the electronic properties. This not only decreases the transition temperature but, in addition, alters the phase transition mechanism, resulting in the ground state deviating from the charge-ordered insulator state of the parent compound. Employing infrared optical spectroscopy, we investigate changes in the charge dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the absence of charge ordering in the Se-substituted materials and suggest that the phase transition is instead driven by the localization of the itinerant charge carriers due to strong electron-phonon interactions.</p>

            <p>The effect of the selenium concentration in the composition of the $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ semiconductor crystals on their etching with a bromine-methanol solution was studied. A thermodynamic model is proposed to describe the degree of etching of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ and $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals. A thermodynamic law is obtained for the first time to describe the change in the etching rate of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals with different selenium concentrations. Experimental dependencies are constructed for etching trajectories and etching rates with 5% bromine-methanol solutions of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystal samples with nominal $x\sim 0.1$ and selenium concentrations of $y=0$, $y=0.02$, $y=0.06$, and $y=0.1$. The average etching rates were 24${\mu }$m/min, 18${\mu }$m/min, 15${\mu }$m/min, and 13${\mu }$m/min. The threshold effect of a strong decrease in the etching rate upon transition from ternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ to quaternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals, associated with hardening of the crystal structure, is identify and theoretically explained. The obtained experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates and will be useful for choosing the optimal regimes of crystal treatment.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gulzar Ahmad, Sergey Saveliev, Steven P Fitzgerald, Marco G Mazza, Andrew J Archer</p>
            <p>Many biological, chemical, and physical systems are underpinned by stochastic transitions between equilibrium states in a potential energy. Here, we consider such transitions in a minimal model with two possible competing pathways, both starting from a local potential energy minimum and eventually finding the global minimum. There is competition between the distance to travel in state space and the height of the potential energy barriers to be surmounted, for the transition to occur. One pathway has a higher energy barrier to go over, but requires traversing a shorter distance, whereas the other pathway has a lower potential barrier but it is substantially further away in configuration space. The most likely pathway taken depends on the available time for the transition process; when only a relatively short time is available, the most likely path is the one over the higher barrier. We find that upon varying temperature the overall most likely pathway can switch from one to the other. We calculate the statistics of where the barrier crossing occurs and the distribution of times taken to reach the potential minimum. Interestingly, while the configuration space statistics is complex, the time of arrival statistics is rather simple, having an exponential probability density over most of the time range. Taken together, our results show that empirically observed rates in nonequilibrium systems should not be used to infer barrier heights.</p>

            <h2>Synchronization transitions and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model with Lévy noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Zhao, Jürgen Kurths, Norbert Marwan, Yong Xu</p>
            <p>Synchronization in various complex networks is significantly influenced by higher-order interactions combined with non-Gaussian stochastic perturbations, yet their mechanisms remain mainly unclear. In this paper, we systematically investigate the synchronization and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model subjected to non-Gaussian Lévy noise. Using the mean order parameter, mean first-passage time, and basin stability, we identify clear boundaries distingusihing synchronization and incoherent states under different stability indexes and scale parameters of Lévy noise. For fixed coupling parameters, synchronization weakens as the stability index decreases, and even completely disappears when the scale parameter exceeds a critical threshold. By varying coupling parameters, we find significant dynamical phenomena including bifurcations and hysteresis. Lévy noise smooths the synchronization transitions and requires stronger coupling compared to Gaussian white noise. Furthermore, we define spikes and systematically investigate their statistical and spectral characteristics. The maximum number of spikes is observed at small scale parameter. A generalized spectral analysis further reveals burst-like structure via an edit distance algorithm. Moreover, a power-law distribution is observed in the large inter-window intervals of spikes, showing great memory effects. These findings deepen the understanding of synchronization and extreme events in complex networks driven by non-Gaussian Lévy noise.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous $π$ flux trapping in granular rings of unconventional superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junyi Zhang, Yi Li</p>
            <p>We study Josephson couplings in unconventional superconductors from a symmetry-based perspective, extending the Sigrist-Rice formula to broader classes of pairing symmetries and in the presence of junction interface disorder effects. Applying this formalism to granular superconducting rings, we show that single-band chiral superconductors cannot spontaneously trap magnetic flux, which rules out chiral $p$-wave pairing as a candidate for $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor, given the observation of half quantum flux in recent Little-Parks experiments. Taking into account the full crystalline symmetry and time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state of $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, we propose that the effective pairing is a triplet helical equal-spin state, enforced by spin-orbit couplings arising from local inversion symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate that granular rings of such helical superconductors can support spontaneous flux trapping, even in the presence of strong junction interface orientation disorder. Our proposal reconciles apparent inconsistencies among different experimental observations and highlights the crucial role of local inversion symmetry breaking in understanding the pairing symmetry in $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd.</p>

            <p>Mixtures of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (Dex) represent a widely used class of aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), with applications ranging from the purification of various biomolecules such as nucleic acids to the synthesis of protocells. A key feature underlying these applications is the selective accumulation of biomolecules within Dex-rich droplets in an aqueous PEG phase, but the physical origin of this partitioning remains unclear. Depletion interactions were long assumed to be the primary driving force; however, our systematic experiments using DNA of different lengths indicate that depletion alone cannot fully explain the observed behavior. We identify an additional and previously underappreciated contribution from electrostatic interactions: Dex carries a slightly more negative charge than PEG, which drives preferential cation accumulation in the Dex-rich phase. These counterions facilitate the selective partitioning of DNA inside the Dex-rich droplets. This mechanism explains the dependency of DNA uptake in Dex-rich droplets on polymer length and salt concentration. Our findings establish Donnan-type ion partitioning as a central principle of nucleic acid localization in Dex-rich droplets, offering a unified explanation for this long-standing phenomenon. They lay the foundation for designing ATPS-based systems and help elucidate the physicochemical principles of biomolecular partition upon phase separation in cells.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Zhan, Huaiyu Zhang, Yu Wang, Baojie Feng, Peng Cheng, Lan Chen</p>
            <p>Magnetic monopoles, hypothetical particles behaving as isolated magnetic charges, have long been predicted by theories beyond the standard model but remain elusive in experimental detection. In this study, we demonstrate a novel method to induce and detect magnetic monopoles on the surface of three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By applying a radially distributed electric field via the STM tip to induce an image magnetic monopole using the topological magnetoelectric (TME) effect, we observe electric field-dependent intrinsic splitting peaks of image potential states (IPS) on the surface of a 3D high-order TI Bi(111). These IPS splitting phenomena originate from the Zeeman effect of the orbital magnetic moments interacting with the magnetic field generated by the magnetic monopoles. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical modeling, successfully demonstrate the detection of magnetic monopole. This work not only deepens our understanding of topological field theory and axion insulators but also opens new avenues for detecting and manipulating magnetic monopoles. The findings suggest that similar studies can be extended to other topological insulator systems, offering potential applications in quantum computing and novel electronic devices.</p>

            <h2>The influence of solute induced memory on interface migration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chad W. Sinclair, Jörg Rottler</p>
            <p>Interface migration governs microstructural evolution during phase transformations and grain growth thereby dictating those material properties that depend on microstructure. Recent work continues to highlight the rich range of behaviors exhibited by migrating interfaces and the complex connection between these behaviors and the underlying atomistic processes that determine coarse-grained interfacial mobility. For interfaces moving at low homologous temperatures and small driving forces, we show that significant non-Markovian effects can arise that invalidate commonly used analysis methods. Specifically, we demonstrate that solute can act as a source of such non-Markovian motion. In turn, we introduce a time-local (TCL) propagator approach to account for memory-dominated short and intermediate time interface dynamics. This approach extrapolates to the long time diffusive limit, enabling robust mobility estimates from simulation windows far shorter than those required to observe linear scaling directly. Comparison with solute-free boundaries validates the method and quantifies solute drag in the Cahn-Hillert sense, providing a route to extract drag coefficients and effective mobilities across a range of solute concentrations. Our results demonstrate that analysis including memory is essential for connecting atomistic simulations to continuum models and offer a practical framework for studying interface kinetics in systems with slow internal processes.</p>

            <p>The supermoiré lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moiré patterns, dramatically reshapes the electronic band structure by introducing new minibands and modifying band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic interactions within moiré flat bands lead to the emergence of various correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoiré lattice on the flat band systems with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the existence of the supermoiré lattice in the mirror-symmetry-broken twisted trilayer graphene, elucidating its role in generating mini-flat bands and mini-Dirac bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate interaction-induced symmetry-broken phases in the supermoiré mini-flat bands alongside the cascade of superconductor-insulator transitions enabled by the supermoiré lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in the mirror-symmetry-broken TTG and underscores the significance of the supermoiré lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties in twisted multilayer systems, sheds light on the correlated quantum phases such as superconductivity in the original moiré flat bands, and highlights the potential of using the supermoiré lattice to design and simulate novel quantum phases.</p>

            <p>A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic ordering. In rhombohedral (RH) stacked graphene, the angular momentum breaking TRS can result from the orbital degree of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in Berry curvature between the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG), achieved without the introduction of a moiré superlattice. At moderate displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This interplay between valley polarization, orbital magnetism, and electric and magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of RHG. Our findings present crystalline RHG as a minimal, tunable platform for studying symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering insight into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric response.</p>

            <p>The realization of robust Majorana zero modes (MZMs), a cornerstone for fault-tolerant quantum computing, is hindered by the challenge of creating a platform that simultaneously offers a large topological gap, high tunability, and resilience to disorder. A system unifying these properties has remained elusive. Here, we propose and validate a novel platform that harnesses the Meissner effect in a topological insulator (TI) nanowire partially covered by a superconducting (SC) layer. Under an external magnetic field, Meissner screening currents in the SC induce a spatially varying Doppler shift on the TI surface. This effect generates a highly anisotropic effective g-factor, which selectively drives a topological phase transition localized on the nanowire's bottom surface. This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the topological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced superconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the interface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the topological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our platform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's topologically protected surface states. Through a combination of supercurrent simulations, self-consistent Schrödinger-Poisson calculations, and large-scale tight-binding computations, we validate the platform's robustness. Our work establishes a practical pathway toward Meissner-mediated topological superconductivity for realizing robust MZMs in SC/TI hybrid systems.</p>

            <p>The majority of analysis of interacting systems is done for weak and well-balanced interactions, when in fact topology and rare event factors often result in strong and sign-biased interactions when considering real systems. We analyse the impact of strong mutualistic interactions in a uniformly weighted Erdős-Rényi network under generalised Lotka-Volterra dynamics. In difference to the typical case we show the interaction topology and system dynamics combine to produce power law abundance distributions in a critical region of the phase diagram, identifiable as a Griffiths phase. We find asymptotic expressions for the fixed point solution in this region, and establish the boundary of this region as when topology alone determines the abundance distribution. We show that the Griffiths phase persists for strong mutualistic interactions more generally, and survives when combined with weak all-to-all competition.</p>

We derive a generic formula expressed by Bloch wave functions and apply it to a minimal model for representative altermagnets, RuO$_{2}$ and MnF$_{2}$. Our results show that the intrinsic spin accumulation can be nonzero in magnetic insulators in sharp contrast to the magnetic spin Hall conductivity.</p>

            <p>Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) crystals are a new category of hybrid glass formers. However, the glass-forming compositions of MIOC crystals are limited due to lack of both a general design principle for such compositions and a deep understanding of the structure and formation mechanism for MIOC glasses. This work reports a general approach for synthesizing glass-forming MIOC crystals. In detail, the principle of this approach is based on the creation of hydrogen-bonded structural network by substituting acid anions for imidazole or benzimidazole ligands in the tetrahedral units of zeolitic imidazolate framework crystals. By tuning the metal centers, anions, and organic ligands of MIOCs, supramolecular unit structures can be designed to construct supramolecular networks and thereby enable property modulation. Furthermore, mixed-ligand synthesis yielded a mixed-crystal system in which the glass-transition temperature (Tg) can be linearly tuned from 282 K to 360 K through gradual substitution of benzimidazole for imidazole. Interestingly, upon vitrification, MIOCs were observed to undergo reorganization of hydrogen-bonded networks, with retention of tetrahedral units, short-range disorder, and the freezing of multiple conformations. This work offers a new strategy to systematically expand the glass-forming compositional range of MIOCs and to develop functional MIOC glasses.</p>

            <p>Using time dependent simulations, we analyze the trajectories of electrons released from a quantum dot in a waveguide made of a spin-orbit-coupled material (InSb). An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full quantum mechanical simulations</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakub Jurczyk, Leo Brockhuis, Amalio Fernández-Pacheco, Ivo Utke</p>
            <p>Recent advances in nanotechnology have created the need to manufacture three-dimensional nanostructures with controlled material composition. Focused Electron Beam Induced Deposition (FEBID) is a nanoprinting technique offering highest spatial resolution combined with the ability to directly 3D-print almost any shape. It relies on local electron-induced dissociation of metal-ligand organometallic molecules adsorbed onto a substrate. So far FEBID continuum modelling involved the surface kinetics of precursor molecules during electron irradiation and succeeded in the prediction of nanoprint shape and growth rate and forms nowadays the basis of software for 3D nano-printing of nanostructures. Here, we expand the model to the surface kinetics of detached ligands. Involving their dissociation and desorption behavior allows to predict trends in the metallic composition of the nanoprinted material and to define desirable nanoprint process windows as function of electron exposure time and flux. We present the theoretical foundations of the model, validate it experimentally for chromium and silver precursors, compare calculated values with literature data for various precursors, and discuss its potential to design new experiments. This contribution enhances our understanding of FEBID dynamics and provides a versatile framework for predictive FEBID material nano-printing.</p>

            <p>The ability to fabricate anisotropic superconducting layers a la carte is desired in technologies such as fluxon screening or removal in field-resilient devices, flux lensing in ultra-sensitive sensors, or in templates for imprinting magnetic structures in hybrid magnetic/superconducting multilayers. In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in microelectronic superconducting technology.</p>

            <h2>Geometric flow of planar domain-wall loops</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pablo Domenichini, German Salazar, Alejandro B. Kolton</p>
            <p>We investigate the geometric evolution of elastic domain-wall loops in two dimensions. Assuming an instantaneous, isotropic, and homogeneous arc-velocity response of the domain wall to external pressure and local signed curvature, we derive closed dynamical equations linking the enclosed area and loop perimeter for both linear and nonlinear arc-velocity response functions. This reduced description enables predictions for the dynamics of both spontaneous and externally driven domains-subjected to constant or alternating fields-within the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau scalar $\phi ^4$ model. In the linear response regime, where a non-crossing principle holds in the absence of external driving, we obtain exact results. In particular, we demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the total spontaneous magnetization becomes quantized for arbitrary initial conditions involving multiple, possibly nested, loops, with discrete jumps corresponding to individual loop collapse events. Under external driving, the avoidance principle breaks down due to sparse interactions between interfaces-either within a single loop or between multiple loops-leading to coalescence or splitting events that change the number of loops. A quantized geometrical observable involving the total area and perimeter is identified in this case as well, exhibiting discrete jumps both at interface interaction events and at individual loop collapses. We further use approximate area-perimeter relations to estimate the spontaneous collapse lifetimes of compact magnetic domains, as well as their dynamics under alternating-field-assisted collapse in disordered ultrathin magnetic films. Our predictions are compared with experimental observations in such systems.</p>

            <p>While the autonomous assembly of hard nanoparticles with different shapes has been studied extensively both in experiment and simulations, little is known about systems where particle shape can be dynamically altered. DNA origami nanostructures offer an alternative route to synthesize nanoparticles that can change their shape on demand. Motivated by recent experiments, here we study the structure and dynamics of suspensions of hard squares in response to an elongation into a rectangle. Performing extensive hard-particle Monte Carlo simulations at constant volume and employing two protocols, we numerically analyze the collective diffusion and ordering during quenching and the subsequent relaxation to the new equilibrium state. We find that the cascading protocol, which mimics experimentally realized DNA origami, can become dynamically arrested due to the increase in effective packing fraction.</p>

            <p>SrTiO3 is a textbook quantum paraelectric, with ferroelectricity purportedly suppressed by quantum fluctuations of ionic positions down to the lowest temperatures. The precise real space structure of SrTiO3 at low temperature, however, has remained undefined despite decades of study. Here we directly image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum parelectric SrTiO3, using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy down to 20 K. High resolution imaging reveals a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale domains of finite polarization. The short-range polar domains first grow and self-organize into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers. However, the process reverses when entering the quantum paraelectric regime below 40 K and the periodically ordered polar nanodomains fragment into small clusters.</p>

            <h2>The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Javier Aguilar, Miguel A. Muñoz, Sandro Azaele</p>
            <p>Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution, resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size -- shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex systems.</p>

            <h2>A minimal model of self-organized clusters with phase transitions in ecological communities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shing Yan Li, Mehran Kardar, Zhijie Feng, Washington Taylor</p>
            <p>In complex ecological communities, species may self-organize into clusters or clumps where highly similar species can coexist. The emergence of such species clusters can be captured by the interplay between neutral and niche theories. Based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model of competition, we propose a minimal model for ecological communities in which the steady states contain self-organized clusters. In this model, species compete only with their neighbors in niche space through a common interaction strength. Unlike many previous theories, this model does not rely on random heterogeneity in interactions. By varying only the interaction strength, we find an exponentially large set of cluster patterns with different sizes and combinations. There are sharp phase transitions into the formation of clusters. There are also multiple phase transitions between different sets of possible cluster patterns, many of which accumulate near a small number of critical points. We analyze such a phase structure using both numerical and analytical methods. In addition, the special case with only nearest neighbor interactions is exactly solvable using the method of transfer matrices from statistical mechanics. We analyze the critical behavior of these systems and make comparisons with existing lattice models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Natalie E. Hooven, Arthur Y. Lin, Rose K. Cersonsky</p>
            <p>Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) have surged in popularity due to their promise of expanding the spatiotemporal scales possible for simulating molecules with high fidelity. The accuracy of any MLIP is dependent on the data used for its training; thus, for large molecules, like polymers, where accurate training data is prohibitively difficult to obtain, it becomes necessary to pursue non-traditional methods to construct MLIPs, many of which are based on constructing MLIPs using smaller, analogous chemical systems. However, we have yet to understand the limits to which smaller molecules can be used as a proxy for extrapolating macromolecular energetics. Here, we provide a ``control study'' for such experiments, exploring the ability of MLIP approaches to extrapolate between n=1-8 n-polyalkanes at identical conditions. Through Principal Covariates Classification, we quantitatively demonstrate how convergence in chemical environments between training and testing datasets coincides with an MLIP's transferability. Additionally, we show how careful attention to the construction of an MLIP's neighbor list can promote greater transferability when considering various levels of the energetic hierarchy. Our results establish a roadmap for how one can create transferable MLIPs for macromolecular systems without the prohibitive cost of constructing system-specific training data.</p>

            <h2>Two-dimensional THz spectroscopy in electronic systems: a many-body diagrammatic approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Fiore, Niccolò Sellati, Mattia Udina, Lara Benfatto</p>
            <p>The term two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) usually refers to experimental setups where a coherently generated electric field in a sample is recorded over many runs as a function of two time variables: the delay $\tau$ between two consequent excitation pulses and the time $t$ over which the signal is emitted. While its implementation in the femtosecond time domain for studying vibrational molecular states has been developed for over two decades, its experimental application in the THz domain to interacting electronic systems remains in its infancy. This work provides a general theoretical framework for describing and interpreting 2DCS using a many-body language based on a perturbative diagrammatic expansion, as widely applied in linear spectroscopy. Focusing on centrosymmetric systems, we show that interpreting the 2D maps can be recast into two complementary problems. The first is the evaluation of a third-order response function to the gauge field. In the velocity gauge, this leads to semi-analytical expressions that both reduce computational complexity and assist in assigning spectral features to microscopic processes, as shown using a toy model of electrons undergoing a charge-density wave transition. The second is a careful treatment of multi-wave propagation effects, which, in bulk systems, can obscure the intrinsic nonlinear response, demonstrated here for soft superconducting Josephson plasmons. Our results provide a solid foundation for extending 2DCS to complex interacting systems and offer a flexible method to realistically model nonlinear responses across arbitrary spectral widths.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maggie Liu, Arnold J. T. M. Mathijssen</p>
            <p>The collective motion of microorganisms and microrobots can be used for particle delivery, especially when guided by external magnetic fields, phototaxis, or chemotaxis. This cargo transport is enhanced significantly by hydrodynamic entrainment, where the surrounding fluid and any dissolved molecules or suspended cargo particles are dragged along with a collectively moving swarm. However, it remains unclear how this directed entrainment is affected by stochastic run-tumble motion, and how such motility patterns couple to particle dispersion. Here, we combine theory and simulations to compute the entrainment velocity and diffusivity for different degrees of swimmer directedness. Surprisingly, we find that the transport efficiency Péclet number, the ratio of advective to diffusive transport, is optimal for intermediate directedness values, so perfectly guided active suspensions perform worse than those with stochastic reorientations. These results could have implications for microrobotic drug delivery and nutrient transport in microbial environments.</p>

            <p>Al-Mg-Si alloys are utilized in large scale electrical conduction applications thanks to their low density, high strength, and low electrical resistivity. The alloying elements, Mg and Si, are introduced to improve the mechanical strength; however, the formed defects also suppress electrical conductivity, adversely affecting the material performance. Here, we investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and the corresponding microstructure, on the electrical resistivity of overaged alloys having 0.5-9.5 at. % solute. The crystal structure, composition, and microstructure are characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The electrical resistivity of the microstructural components, i.e., the Al solid solution matrix and the Si and Mg2Si precipitates, are directly measured using a microscale four-point probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope. We find that the Al solid solution matrix is up to 15 % more resistive than pure Al, depending on the heat treatment rather than the composition, and that regions including Si or Mg2Si precipitates are equally resistive. Additionally, the bulk alloy resistivity, measured conventionally on a macroscopic length scale, increases linearly up to 60 % with increasing total solute concentration up to ~ 10 at. %. This study relates the electrical resistivity of Al-Mg-Si alloys, measured at microscopic and macroscopic length scales, with their microstructure and composition.</p>

            <p>We investigate the ground state properties of spinless fermions on a two leg ladder, by allowing the nearest-neighbour hopping dimerization in one leg and uniform hopping in the other. In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition as a function of interaction. Moreover, we show that for both the non-interacting and interacting cases, topological nature of the system survives even by altering the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg, resulting in two topological phases of opposite character. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.</p>

            <p>Emergent collective excitations constitute a hallmark of interacting quantum many-body systems, yet in solid-state platforms their study has been largely limited by the constraints of linear-response probes and by finite momentum resolution. We propose to overcome these limitations by combining the spatial resolution of ultracold atomic systems with the nonlinear probing capabilities of two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DS). As a concrete illustration, we analyze momentum-resolved 2DS of the quantum sine-Gordon model describing the low energy dynamics of two weakly coupled one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. This approach reveals distinctive many-body signatures, most notably asymmetric cross-peaks reflecting the interplay between isolated ($B_2$ breather) and continuum ($B_1$ pair) modes. The protocol further enables direct characterization of anharmonicity and disorder, establishing momentum-resolved 2DS as both a powerful diagnostic for quantum simulators and a versatile probe of correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Nolte, Jörn Bonse, Nadezhda M. Bulgakova</p>
            <p>Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</p>

            <p>High power lasers are used for a variety of manufacturing processes on time and length scales that cover many orders of magnitude and on different materials. The variety of processes achievable through laser-material interaction results from numerous coupled, nonlinear physical phenomena. Simulation models can be used to gain process understanding, explain experimentally observed phenomena, and optimize or design processes. However, the inherent complexity and diversity of the phenomena make modeling a challenging task. Within this chapter, a universal model is presented that accurately simulates a broad spectrum of processes, including welding, additive manufacturing, cutting, ablation, drilling, and surface structuring, encompassing both continuous wave and ultrashort pulsed lasers and their interaction with various materials. Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that captures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite Volume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where detailed experimental data are available. Macroscopic examples with continuous wave lasers include keyhole drilling and collapse under stationary illumination as well as melt pool dynamics and pore formation in copper welding. At the microscopic level, copper ablation with femtosecond pulses is simulated. Finally, a set of real-world applications is shown, where the model helps to explain and optimize industrial phenomena and defects. Examples include deep penetration welding of steel with dynamic beam shaping, multilayer additive manufacturing via powder bed fusion, and ultrashort pulsed drilling of micro vias in dielectric materials.</p>

            <p>Mechanistic microstructure-informed constitutive models for the mechanical response of polycrystals are a cornerstone of computational materials science. However, as these models become increasingly more complex - often involving coupled differential equations describing the effect of specific deformation modes - their associated computational costs can become prohibitive, particularly in optimization or uncertainty quantification tasks that require numerous model evaluations. To address this challenge, surrogate constitutive models that balance accuracy and computational efficiency are highly desirable. Data-driven surrogate models, that learn the constitutive relation directly from data, have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we develop two local surrogate models for the viscoplastic response of a steel: a piecewise response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates are designed to adapt to complex material behavior, which may vary with material parameters or operating conditions. The surrogate constitutive models are applied to creep simulations of HT-9 steel, an alloy of considerable interest to the nuclear energy sector due to its high tolerance to radiation damage, using training data generated from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) simulations. We define a set of test metrics to numerically assess the accuracy of our surrogate models for predicting viscoplastic material behavior, and show that the mixture of experts model outperforms the piecewise response surface method in terms of accuracy.</p>

            <p>We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.</p>

            <p>Measuring universal data in the strongly correlated regime of quantum critical points remains a fundamental objective for quantum simulators. In foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular, the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions: ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data to be extracted from realistic quenches.</p>

In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.</p>

            <h2>BCS superconductivity in the presence of wave dark matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yechan Kim, Hye-Sung Lee, Jiheon Lee, Jaeok Yi</p>
            <p>In the established era of dark matter, condensed matter Hamiltonians-including those of superconductors-may require extension to account for the surrounding Galactic environment. We show that if dark matter is wave-like and couples weakly to electrons, superconducting parameters such as the gap and critical temperature become dynamical quantities that oscillate in time. This modifies the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer framework and produces distinctive temporal signatures whose sensitivity increases with longer measurement durations. Our results illustrate how condensed matter systems, traditionally treated as isolated from their cosmological environment, may acquire new dynamical degrees of freedom from their cosmic embedding. This, in turn, offers a novel window into the dark sector.</p>

            <p>High-throughput materials discovery and studies of complex functional materials increasingly rely on multi-modal characterization performed at synchrotron light sources. However, measurements are typically done with no use of data until after an experiment, neglecting opportunities for data-driven insights to guide measurements. We developed a modular, open-source framework that incorporates artificial intelligence within the Bluesky control and data streaming infrastructure at NSLS-II, enabling real-time orchestration of multi-beamline, multi-modal experiments. AI agents perform on-the-fly reduction, clustering, Gaussian process modelling, and Bayesian optimization driven data acquisition, while users monitor agent behavior and visualize results live. Combinatorial libraries of the ternary Al-Ni-Pt system were spatially mapped by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the PDF and BMM beamlines, respectively. Dynamic switching between AI-driven and conventional grid mapping strategies was achieved, demonstrating the flexible workflows possible through this framework. A digital twin constructed from a simulated Al-Li-Fe oxide dataset shows that AI-driven mapping strategies outperform conventional mapping as well as random sampling by prioritizing measurements that better resolve both phase boundaries and localized minority phases. This framework supports plug-and-play capabilities, and establishes a foundation for routine multi-modal, AI-assisted large-scale user-facility operations.</p>

            <p>We present a simple 'shift-and-add' based improvement in the angular resolution of single electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis. In particular, this method has the potential to enhance the scope of small compact direct electron detectors (DEDs).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saleh Bunaiyan, Corentin Delacour, Shuvro Chowdhury, Kyle Lee, Kerem Y. Camsari</p>
            <p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.</p>

            <h2>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atma Anand</p>
            <p>Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</p>

            <p>Entanglement is central to quantum science and technology. Atomic defects in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exciting prospects for quantum sensing, with spatial resolution reaching 1 nm demonstrated using scanning probe techniques. However, entangling qubits in vdW materials remains elusive. Here we report room-temperature quantum entanglement between an optically addressable electron spin and a strongly coupled $^{13}$C nuclear spin in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We extend the electron spin coherence to 38 $\mu$s with dynamical decoupling, and create maximally entangled Bell states with a fidelity up to 0.89. We further use the nuclear spin as a long-lived quantum memory to enhance AC magnetic field sensing via correlation spectroscopy. These results establish entangled spin qubits in hBN as a robust platform for advanced quantum technologies based on 2D materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyi Meng, Benjamin Piazza, Csaba Both, Baruch Barzel, Albert-László Barabási</p>
            <p>The brain's connectome and the vascular system are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout, and ultimately their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organisation. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of length and volume minimisation. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimisation problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimisation onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory, predicting that with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimisation. Specifically, surface minimisation predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organisation of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which not only are prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi.</p>

            <p>The search for primordial B-modes in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) requires highly sensitive and scalable detector systems. The magnetic microbolometer (MMB) is an emerging detector concept that exploits the magnetic properties of paramagnetic materials at sub-kelvin temperatures, offering bolometers with a high dynamic range and low intrinsic noise. In recent years, the microwave SQUID multiplexer ($\mu$MUX) has become a key technology to efficiently read large low temperature detector arrays, enabling the readout of hundreds to thousands of detectors over a single transmission line with low noise and minimal power dissipation while reducing the cryogenic setup complexity. In this work, we report the design, fabrication and characterization of a $\mu$MUX optimized for MMB detectors and share our latest experimental results from a bolometer prototype. These findings provide valuable insight of the $\mu$MUX in advancing next-generation CMB instrumentation and also demonstrate its suitability for novel detector technologies such as the MMB.</p>

            <p>Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands'' form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory, we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoshiko Ogata, David Pérez-García, Alberto Ruiz-de-Alarcón</p>
            <p>Haag duality is a strong notion of locality for two-dimensional lattice quantum spin systems, requiring that the commutant of the algebra of observables supported in a cone-like region coincides with the algebra of observables in its complement. Originally introduced within algebraic quantum field theory, Haag duality has recently become pivotal in the operator-algebraic analysis of quantum many-body systems. In particular, it plays a key role in the description of anyonic excitations, which are widely believed to classify two-dimensional non-chiral gapped quantum phases of matter. Prior to this work, Haag duality had only been rigorously established for Kitaev's quantum double models with abelian input groups. In this paper, we establish that two-dimensional tensor network states based on biconnected $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras satisfy Haag duality. These states include as particular cases Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and we expect them to encompass representatives of all non-chiral phases. Our proof relies on deriving an operator-algebraic sufficient condition for Haag duality in finite systems, which we verify using tensor-network methods. As part of our analysis, we extend the tensor-network bulk-boundary correspondence, construct explicit commuting parent Hamiltonians for these models, and prove that in the biconnected case they satisfy the local topological quantum order condition.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohsen Gheisarieha, Ramtin M. Yazdi, Arash Arabi Ardehali</p>
            <p>We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, while larger $N$ is analogous to multi-channel or higher-spin impurity scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</p>

            <p>Topological boundary states exhibit distinctive properties, including unidirectional propagation and noise robustness, which hold significant potential for advancing the performance of quantum science and technology. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of non-Abelian quantum interference and entanglement generation, protected by dual symmetries (time-independent inversion and time-dependent interchain), in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Specifically, in a multi-chain system, we first achieve tunable topological transfer of a single particle, where the destination chain is selected by the braiding sequence. We then extend this to two particles, observing a non-Abelian Hong-Ou-Mandel interference that generates spatially entangled NOON states whose properties are dictated by the braiding order. Our work establishes an alternative pathway for exploring non-Abelian topology applied to quantum science and technology, enabled by the unique protection of time-dependent symmetry.</p>

            <p>In this article, we study experimentally the dispersion of colloids in a two-dimensional, time independent, Rayleigh-Bénard flow in the presence of salt gradients. Due to the additional scalar, the colloids do not follow exactly the Eulerian flow-field, but have a (small) extra-velocity $\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{dp}} = D_{\mathrm{dp}} \nabla \log C_s$, where $D_\mathrm{dp}$ is the phoretic constant and $C_s$ the salt concentration. Such a configuration is motivated by the theoretical work by Volk \textit{et al.} (JFM, 2022), which predicted enhanced transport or blockage in a stationary cellular flow depending on the value of a blockage coefficient. By means of High Dynamical Range Light Induced Fluorescence, we study the evolution of the colloids concentration field at large Péclet number. We find a good agreement with the theoretical work although a number of hypotheses are not satisfied, as the experiment is non homogeneous in space and intrinsically transient. In particular we observe enhanced transport when salt and colloids are injected at both ends of the Rayleigh-Bénard chamber, and blockage when colloids and salt are injected together and phoretic effects are strong enough.</p>

            <p>Micro/nanoporous membranes have been used extensively in biological and medical applications associated with filtration, particle sorting, cell separation, and real-time sensing. Expanding its applications to microfluidics offers several advantages, such as precise control over fluid flow rates, regulated reaction times, and efficient product extraction. This study demonstrates a simple, cost-effective, rapid, single-step method for the synthesis of nanoporous membranes within a microfluidic device. The membrane is prepared by filling up the microchamber with cellulose acetate dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide, and 1-hexanol, followed by the continuous flow of water as an antisolvent. Mixing CA-DMF with antisolvent water leads to an in-situ synthesis of cellulose acetate nanoparticles (CANPs) at the Water-DMF interface. The continuous flow of water ensures the coagulation of CANPs, forming nanoporous membranes. The thickness, porosity, and wettability of the membrane are dependent on the flow rate of water and the concentration of CA dissolved in DMF. Apart from its wide application in cell and biomolecule separation, this membrane can be used to detect biomarkers or pathogens in clinical samples. Additionally, these nanoporous membranes can be used to detect and filter environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and emulsified oil from water. In summary, the synthesis of CANP nanoporous membranes within microfluidic channels with adjustable porosity enhances the potential uses of micro/nanomembranes in both healthcare and environmental contexts.</p>

We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shupeng Xu, Dun Wang, Ritesh Agarwal</p>
            <p>We develop a general theory for twisted bilayer photonic crystals that takes into account both far-field response and near-field coupling. The theory is based on the framework of a generalized Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. A universal form for interlayer coupling is derived, which relates the hopping strength to the Fourier transforms of the Wannier functions in the single layer photonic crystal. For low energy states at the K point in hexagonal lattices, the interlayer coupling reduces to that in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for graphene. As an example, we study a twisted bilayer photonic crystal slab with air holes arranged in a honeycomb lattice in each layer. The first order solution of our model predicts a four-fold band splitting in the far-field spectrum compared to the single-layer case, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, our theory reveals that for low energy states at K points, scattering towards the {\Gamma} point via the moiré potential is suppressed. Based on our theory, we propose a wide-angle, high-Q tunable flat band cavity by combining the bilayer at a large twist angle with a Brillouinzone-folding perturbation within each layer. The cavity behaves like a collection of quasi-bound states in the continuum with a divergent density of states, with potential applications in nonlinear optics, lasing and quantum optics.</p>

            <p>Ecological interactions can dramatically alter evolutionary outcomes in complex communities. Yet, the classic theoretical results of population genetics (e.g., Kimura's fixation formula) largely ignore ecological effects. Here, we address this shortcoming by using dynamical mean-field theory to integrate ecology into classical population genetics models. We show that ecological interactions between parents and mutants result in frequency-dependent selection and can be characterized by a single emergent parameter that measures the strength of ecological feedbacks. We derive an explicit analytic expression for the fixation probability that generalizes Kimura's famous result and analyze it in various ecological and evolutionary limits. We find that ecological interactions suppress fixation probabilities for moderately beneficial mutants when compared to Kimura's predictions, with the strength of suppression increasing with larger effective population sizes, greater selective differences between parent and mutant, and for ecosystems with a large number of "open niches" (i.e., ecosystems well below the packing bound). Frequency-dependent selection also gives rise to prolonged parent-mutant coexistence in complex communities, a phenomenon absent in classical population genetics. Our study establishes a framework for integrating ecological interactions into population genetics models and helps illuminate how ecology can affect evolutionary outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Decoupling hydrodynamization from thermalization via nonlinear Boltzmann equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingjian Lu, Shuzhe Shi</p>
            <p>The early thermalization puzzle arises from the unexpectedly early applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy-ion collisions. While hydrodynamics has traditionally been associated with the onset of local thermal equilibrium, its derivations -- whether microscopic or macroscopic -- rely instead on linearization around equilibrium. However, the linearization timescale -- the time at which a system's evolution begins to follow a linearized equation -- has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we employ the spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation -- the lowest-order truncation of the spectral Bogoliubov--Born--Green--Kirkwood--Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy -- to analyze the timescales of linearization and thermalization under three distinct truncation schemes. The first two truncations allow for analytic treatment via recursive spectral equations, while the third requires numerical methods for generic initial conditions. The analysis is performed for a homogeneous, massless system with a constant differential cross section. For this simplified setup, we find a robust separation: the linearization time is consistently about half the thermalization time ($\tau_{\mathrm{lin}}/\tau_{\mathrm{therm}} \approx 1/2$). This separation of timescales suggests an explanation for the early applicability of hydrodynamics and points toward a possible quantitative resolution of the early thermalization puzzle.</p>

            <p>Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials. First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.</p>

Here we propose to generate magnon squeezed states in a hybrid cavity-magnon-qubit system by engineering an effective Rabi-type magnon-qubit interaction. This is achieved by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode and driving the qubit with two microwave fields, of which the driving frequencies and amplitudes are properly selected. By operating the system around the critical point associated with the ground-state superradiant phase transition in the normal phase, a magnon parametric amplification-like interaction is induced, leading to a dynamical magnon squeezing. We further analyze the effects of the dissipation, dephasing, and thermal noise on the magnon squeezing. Our results indicate that a moderate degree of squeezing can be produced using currently available parameters in the experiments.</p>

            <p>The quantum Zeno effect (QZE) reveals that frequent measurements can suppress quantum evolution, but the detailed dynamics of the system under finite-duration measurements in experiments remain insufficiently explored. Here, we employ an optical dipole trap as a projective measurement to study the motion of a single cold atom in free space. By monitoring atomic loss, we directly observe the QZE in single-atom motion in free space and find that the effect of dipole measurements on the atom comprises a short-time collapse followed by subsequent periodic unitary evolution, thereby providing an intuitive physical picture of measurement backaction across different timescales. We further investigate the effects of measurement frequency, strength, and spatial position, demonstrating that measurements not only suppress the spreading of quantum states but also enable deterministic preparation of distinct motional states. Furthermore, by dynamically controlling the measurement position, we achieve measurement-induced directional transport of a single atom without imparting additional momentum. Our results provide a direct experimental demonstration of the QZE in real space and establish a versatile framework for measurement-based control of atomic motion, paving the way for motional-state engineering in cold-atom platforms.</p>

Indirect electrical pumping of a dual-cavity perovskite laser was recently obtained, utilizing a well-established technological concept of embedding a high-luminosity light-emitting diode (LED) with a high-gain medium into an integrated device. Direct charge-carrier injection into a perovskite LED excited by auxiliary short-, optical-pulses resulted into amplified spontaneous emission. Other efforts for rational engineering of architectures that allow for high charge-carrier density are still to demonstrate lasing. Here, we develop a novel strategy for achieving direct electrical pumping of a perovskite laser. We integrate a solution-grown CsPbBr3 microplate with chemically inert single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes and embed them into an optical microcavity. By cooling the microdevice down to 8 K at a constant current, a perovskite p-i-n diode is formed that facilitates a balanced carrier injection at high current densities. The perovskite microcavity diode operates in the strong coupling regime, exhibiting polariton lasing under a direct current of 65 uA.</p>

            <h2>An operator-Weyl-symbol approach to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Wang, Wen-ge Wang</p>
            <p>In this letter, by an approach that employs Weyl symbols for operators, a semiclassical theory is developed for the offdiagonal function in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which is for offdiagonal elements $\langle{E_i}\left|O\right|{E_j}\rangle$ of an observable $O$ on the energy basis. It is shown analytically that the matrix of $O$ has a banded structure, possessing a bandwidth $w_b$ that scales linearly with $\hbar$, a phase-space gradient of the classical Hamiltonian, $\langle\left|{\boldsymbol{\nabla }H_{\rm cl}}\right|\rangle$, and an $O$-dependent property. This predicts that the thermalization timescale of a quantum system may be inversely proportional to the phase-space gradient of the Hamiltonian, aligning with intuitions in classical thermalization. This approach also elucidates the origin of a $\rho_{\rm dos}^{-1/2}$-scaling of the offdiagonal function. The analytical predictions are checked numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</p>

            <p>Hereby, we study the generation of pairs of polarization-entangled photons at telecom C-band by biexciton-exciton cascade from non-resonantly excited epitaxial InAs/InP quantum dots (QDs). It is realized without external tuning of the fine structure splitting (FSS), which does not exceed 10 $\mu$eV in as-grown nanostructures, due to their high in-plane symmetry. Excitonic complexes are identified by means of excitation power-dependent and polarization-resolved magneto)microphotoluminescence. Their origin from different carrier configurations confined in the same QD is confirmed by time correlations of emitted photons. Experimental results are supported by 8-band kp calculations, followed by the configuration interaction method to include excitonic effects. This comparison reveals the structure of higher energy states, allowing for the reconstruction of the QD structural parameters. To verify and quantify the entanglement, we perform quantum state tomography and reconstruct the two-photon density matrix. Its diagonalization allows a detailed analysis of the entangled state and reveals an unfavourable interplay between phase accumulation and decoherence, pointing to a clear route for boosting entanglement by using a XX resonant, pulsed excitation scheme and shortening the radiative lifetimes.</p>

We show how such trajectory can be identified from the probability distribution of quantum trajectories, i.e. measurement readouts, and how it successfully captures the monitored dynamics beyond the average state. We prove the method to be exact in the case of Gaussian theories and then extend it to the interacting Sine-Gordon model. Although no longer exact in this framework, the method captures the dynamics through a self-consistent time-dependent harmonic approximation and reveals an entanglement phase transition in the steady state from an area-law to a logarithmic-law scaling.</p>

            <p>Among the thriving quantum computation and quantum simulation platforms based on arrays of Rydberg atoms, those using circular Rydberg atoms are particularly promising. These atoms uniquely combine the strong dipole-dipole interactions typical of Rydberg states with long lifetimes. However, low-angular-momentum ($\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because circular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual detection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform, combining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium with an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\ell$ Rydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical qubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation induced by a Förster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical qubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is highly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the circular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error correction. More strikingly, it gives access to time correlations in long-term quantum simulations, uniquely accessible to circular Rydberg atoms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shihang Zhang, Chunhui Zhang, Guanyong Wang, Tao Xin, Guangchong Hu, Yu He, Peihao Huang</p>
            <p>Significant advances in silicon spin qubits highlight the potential of silicon quantum dots for scalable quantum computing, given their compatibility with industrial fabrication and long coherence times. In particular, phosphorus (P)-doped spin qubits possess excellent coherence and have demonstrated high-fidelity two-qubit gates exceeding 99.9%. However, scaling P-donor systems is challenging due to crosstalk caused by the uniformity of individual P donors and the low tolerance for imprecise atomic placement. Stochastic placement can lead to multiple donors located within a small region (diameter <3 nm), forming a so-called donor cluster. Notably, in cluster-based systems, high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum gates and all-to-all connectivity have recently been demonstrated experimentally on nuclear spin qubits. In this work, we propose a scalable cluster-array architecture for nuclear spin qubits and a corresponding control protocol. We analyze crosstalk-induced errors, a major error source, during primitive operations under various parameters, showing that they can be suppressed through device design and control optimization. We evaluate the fidelities of intra- and inter-cluster multi-qubit gates between nuclear spins, confirming the feasibility of our architecture and establishing design requirements and parameter targets. The local all-to-all connectivity within clusters provides unique flexibility for quantum error correction. Our scalable scheme provides a path toward large-scale spin-based quantum processors.</p>

            <p>Quantum error detection is essential in realizing large-scale universal quantum computation, especially for quantum error correction (QEC). However, key elements for FTQC have yet to be realized in silicon qubits. Here, we demonstrate quantum error detection on a donor-based silicon quantum processor comprising four-nuclear spin qubits and one electron spin as an auxiliary qubit. The entanglement capability of this system is validated through the establishment of two-qubit Bell state entanglement between the nuclear spins and the generation of a four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, achieving a GHZ state fidelity of 88.5(2.3)%. Furthermore, by executing a four-qubit error detection circuit with the stabilizers, we successfully detect arbitrary single-qubit errors. The encoded Bell state entanglement information is recovered by performing the Pauli-frame update (PFU) via postprocessing. Based on the detected errors, we identify strongly biased noise in our system. Our results mark a significant advance toward FTQC in silicon spin qubits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergio Andraus, Nicole Hufnagel, Jacek Małecki</p>
            <p>We consider a system of stochastic interacting particles with general diffusion coefficient and drift functions and we study the types of collisions that arise in them. In particular, interactions between particles are inversely proportional to their separation, and the coupling function of interaction is also considered in great generality. Our main result indicates that under very mild conditions, all collisions are simple almost surely, namely, only one pair of particles collides at any time, while more complicated collisions such as three-body or disjoint two-body collisions occur with zero probability. In order to obtain our results we make use of symmetric polynomials on the square of particle separations; the degree of these polynomials indicates the type of collision, and by a locality argument we show that polynomials indicating a non-simple collision almost surely do not cancel. We make use of our main result to study the Hausdorff dimension of times at which collisions occur, and we show that this dimension is given by the ratio between the interaction coupling and diffusion functions. Our results cover many of the most well-known particle systems, such as the Dyson model and Wishart processes and their extensions to non-constant diffusion coefficients and background drifts.</p>

In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.</p>

            <p>We present a topology grounded, multiscale simulation platform for morphogenesis and biological active matter. Morphogenesis and biological active matter represent keystone problems in biology with additional, far-reaching implications across the biomedical sciences. Addressing these problems will require flexible, cross-scale models of tissue shape, development, and dysfunction that can be tuned to understand, model, and predict relevant individual cases. Current approaches to simulating anatomical or cellular subsystems tend to rely on static, assumed shapes. Meanwhile, the potential for topology to provide natural dimensionality reduction and organization of shape and dynamical outcomes is not fully exploited. TopoSPAM combines ease of use with powerful simulation algorithms and methodological advances, including active nematic gels, topological-defect-driven shape dynamics, and an active 3D vertex model of tissues. It is capable of determining emergent flows and shapes across scales.</p>

Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers, offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.</p>

            <p>Magnetically levitated spinning rotors are key elements in important technologies such as navigation by gyroscopes, energy storage by flywheels, ultra-high vacuum generation by turbomolecular pumps, and pressure sensing for process control. However, mechanical rotors are typically macroscopic and limited to room temperature and low rotation frequencies. In particular, sensing pressure at low temperatures remains a technological challenge, while emerging quantum technologies demand a precise evaluation of pressure conditions at low temperatures to cope with quantum-spoiling decoherence. To close this gap, we demonstrate wide range pressure sensing by a spinning rotor based on a micromagnet levitated by the Meissner effect at 4.2 Kelvin. We achieve rotational speeds of up to 138 million rotations per minute, resulting in very high effective quality factors, outperforming current platforms. Beside sensing applications, we envision the use of levitated rotors for probing fundamental science including quantum mechanics and gravity, enabled by ultralow torque noise.</p>

            <p>Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center Recognition potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</p>

Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Choon-Lin Ho</p>
            <p>A recent interesting development on the dynamics of black hole phase transitions, the Hawking-Page transition, has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing work-extraction in quantum batteries via correlated reservoirs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sejal Ahuja, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>Going beyond isolated system dynamics, we examine how local and spatially correlated reservoirs influence the work extraction in quantum batteries. By employing a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model coupled to baths via dephasing and amplitude-damping noise, we demonstrate that correlations in reservoirs can significantly enhance battery's performance compared to local noise. In the dephasing scenario, we prove that correlated reservoirs produce a finite amount of extractable work, or ergotropy, during the transient regime when a two-cell battery is initialized in a product state while local noise yields vanishing ergotropy at all times, despite nonvanishing stored energy in both cases. Numerical simulations confirm that this advantage persists across larger system sizes and for both entangled and product initial states. We also find that the dynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting coherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum batteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted from quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and local reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains independent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits a clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting distinct operational behaviors under different noise models. In addition, we reveal that when the battery dynamics is governed by an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions, it yields higher ergotropy compared to short-range interactions, emphasizing the advantages of reservoir engineering for efficient device design.</p>

Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have shown superior properties for the applications of magnetic information storage based on the efficient spin torque effect. However, for most of known vdW ferromagnets, the ferromagnetic transition temperatures lower than room temperature strongly impede their applications and the room-temperature vdW spintronic device with low energy consumption is still a long-sought goal. Here, we realize the highly efficient room-temperature nonvolatile magnetic switching by current in a single-material device based on vdW ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. Moreover, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 300 and 60000 times smaller than conventional spin-orbit-torque devices of magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures. These findings make an important progress on the applications of magnetic vdW materials in the fields of spintronics and magnetic information storage.</p>

            <p>Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</p>

            <p>The Hubbard model is a standard theoretical tool for studying materials with strong electron-electron interactions, such as the cuprate superconductors. Unfortunately, interaction-driven phenomena such as the transition into the strongly correlated Mott insulator phase are difficult to treat with established theoretical techniques. However, the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto model displays similar Mott physics. Here we show how the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model can be deformed continuously into the Hubbard model. The trick is to systematically re-introduce all the momentum mixing the original Hatsugai-Kohmoto model omits. This can be accomplished by grouping $n$-momenta into a cell and hybridizing them resulting in the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto (MMHK) model. We recover the Bethe ansatz ground state energy of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to within 1$\%$ from only ten mixed momenta. Overall the convergence scales as $1/n^2$ as opposed to the inverse linear behaviour of standard finite-cluster techniques. Our results for a square lattice reproduce all known features from state-of-the-art simulations also with only a few mixed momenta. Consequently, we believe the MMHK model offers an alternative tool for strongly correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liang Kong, Zhi-Hao Zhang, Jiaheng Zhao, Hao Zheng</p>
            <p>We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. We also establish the connections among various notions of "gauging" symmetries. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai-Zhi Bai, Bo Fu, Shun-Qing Shen</p>
            <p>We develop a Dirac fermion theory for topological phases in magnetic topological insulator films. The theory is based on exact solutions of the energies and the wave functions for an effective model of the three-dimensional topological insulator (TI) film. It is found that the TI film consists of a pair of massless or massive Dirac fermions for the surface states, and a series of massive Dirac fermions for the bulk states. The massive Dirac fermion always carries zero or integer quantum Hall conductance when the valence band is fully occupied while the massless Dirac fermion carries a one-half quantum Hall conductance when the chemical potential is located around the Dirac point for a finite range. The magnetic exchange interaction in the magnetic layers in the film can be used to manipulate either the masses or chirality of the Dirac fermions and gives rise to distinct topological phases, which cover the known topological insulating phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect, quantum spin Hall effect and axion effect, and also the novel topological metallic phases, such as half quantized Hall effect, half quantum mirror Hall effect, and metallic quantum anomalous Hall effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gerald Curran III, Zachary Rex, Casper X. Wilson, Luke J. Weaver, Ivan Biaggio</p>
            <p>We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order of 150 ps in rubrene.</p>

            <h2>A defect-chemistry-informed phase-field model of grain growth in oxide ceramics: application to Fe-doped SrTiO3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Wang, Roger A. De Souza, Xiang-Long Peng, Rotraut Merkle, Wolfgang Rheinheimer, Karsten Albe, Bai-Xiang Xu</p>
            <p>Dopants can significantly affect the properties of oxide ceramics through their impact on the property-determined microstructure characteristics such as grain boundary (GB) segregation, space charge layer formation in the GB vicinity, and the grain growth deviating from normal patterns. To support the rational design of oxide ceramics, we propose a defect-chemistry-informed phase-field grain growth model to simulate the microstructure evolution of oxide ceramics. It fully respects the defect-chemistry theory by accounting for the distinct segregation energies and available site densities of charged point defects (oxygen vacancies and acceptor dopants) in both the grain interior and boundaries, and it considers the competing kinetics of defect diffusion and GB movement. The proposed phase-field model is benchmarked against well-known bicrystal models, including the Mott-Schottky and Gouy-Chapman models. Various simulation results are presented to reveal the effect of different defect-chemistry parameters on the space charge layer formation and key microstructural aspects. In particular, simulation results confirm that the solute drag effect alone can lead to skewed grain size distribution that do not follow the log-normal distribution, without any contribution from grain misorientation and other anisotropy. Interestingly, simulations also demonstrate that grain boundary potentials can vary substantially: GBs of larger grains tend to have lower potentials than those of smaller grains. Such heterogeneous GB potential distribution may inspire a new material optimization strategy through microstructure design. This study provides a comprehensive framework for defect-chemistry-consistent investigations of microstructure evolution in polycrystalline oxide ceramics, offering fundamental insights into microscopic processes during critical manufacturing stages.</p>

            <h2>Flat-band Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov State from Quantum Geometric Discrepancy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zi-Ting Sun, Ruo-Peng Yu, Shuai A. Chen, Jin-Xin Hu, K. T. Law</p>
            <p>We propose a new scheme for realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) Cooper pairing states within flat bands, in contrast to the conventional paradigm such as the Zeeman effect. Central to our scheme is the concept of ``quantum geometric discrepancy'' (QGD) that measures differences in the quantum geometry of paired electrons and drives the flat-band FFLO instability. Remarkably, we find that this instability is directly related to a quantum geometric quantity known as ``anomalous quantum distance'', which formally captures QGD. To model both QGD and the anomalous quantum distance, we examine a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with tunable spin-dependent quantum metrics. Utilizing the band-projection method, we analyze the QGD-induced FFLO instability from pairing susceptibility. Furthermore, we perform mean-field numerical simulations to obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition, which aligns well with our analytical results. Our work demonstrates that QGD offers a general and distinctive mechanism for stabilizing the flat-band FFLO phase.</p>

            <p>We performed time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy on topological Dirac semimetal candidate 1T-ZrTe$_2$. Excited states band mapping uncovers the previously inaccessible linear dispersion of the Dirac cone above the Fermi level. We study the orbital texture of bands using linear dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions. These observations provide hints on the topological character of 1T-ZrTe$_2$. Time-, energy- and momentum-resolved nonequilibrium carrier dynamics reveal that intra- and inter-band scattering processes play a capital role in the relaxation mechanism, leading to multivalley electron-hole accumulation near the Fermi level. We also show that electrons' inverse lifetime has a linear dependence on their binding energy. Our time- and polarization-resolved XUV photoemission results shed light on the excited state electronic structure of 1T-ZrTe$_2$ and provide valuable insights into the relatively unexplored field of quantum-state-resolved ultrafast dynamics in 3D topological Dirac semimetals.</p>

            <h2>Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastian Paeckel</p>
            <p>The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta\omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta\omega = 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this fundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.</p>

The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda, Kouichi Okunishi, Kenji Harada, Tomotoshi Nishino</p>
            <p>Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative study on anomalous Nernst effect in Co thin films by laser irradiation</h2>

            <p>The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) generates electromotive forces transverse to temperature gradients and has attracted much attention for potential applications into novel thermoelectric power generators. ANE efficiency is generally characterized by uniform temperature gradients in a steady state prepared by heaters. However, although focusing laser beams on a magnetic film can form much larger temperature gradients, the laser irradiation method has not been sufficiently considered for quantifying the ANE coefficient due to the difficulty in estimating the localized in-homogeneous temperature gradients. In this study, we present a quantitative study of ANE in Ru(5 nm)/Co($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$) ($t_{\mathrm{Co}}$ = 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 40, and 60 nm) bilayers on sapphire (0001) substrates by combining a laser irradiation approach with finite element analysis of temperature gradients under laser excitation. We find that the estimated ANE coefficients are consistent with previously reported values and one independently characterized using a heater. Our results also reveal the advantages of the laser irradiation method over the conventional method using heaters. Intensity-modulated laser beams can create ac temperature gradients as large as approximately 10$^3$ K/mm at a frequency of tens of kilohertz in a micrometer-scale region.</p>

            <p>Spin fluctuations are an important issue for the design and operation of future spintronic devices. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) was recently applied to detect ultrafast magnetization fluctuations. FemNoC gives direct access to the spontaneous fluctuations of the magnetization in magnetically ordered materials. In FemNoC experiments, the magnetic fluctuations are imprinted on the polarization state of two independent femtosecond probe pulses upon transmission through a magnetic sample. Using a subharmonic demodulation scheme, the cross-correlation of the signals from both pulse trains is calculated. Here, we quantitatively link the FemNoC output signal to an optical polarization rotation, and then in turn to the magnitude of the inherent spin fluctuations. To this end, three different calibration protocols are presented and compared in accuracy. Ultimately, we quantitatively determine both the variance of optical polarization noise in rad$^2$, and that of the ultrafast magnetization fluctuations in (A/m)$^2$.</p>

            <p>The impact of Ge vacancies on the low-temperature lattice dynamics of single-crystalline GeTe was investigated through a comparative study of two off-stoichiometric samples: Ge$_{0.8}$Te (S$_1$) and Ge$_{0.88}$Te (S$_2$). X-ray diffraction confirms their highly oriented crystalline nature mainly along the $h0l$ plane, while temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals pronounced anharmonicity in S$_1$, indicated by stronger three-phonon scattering in the in-plane E-mode. A suppressed Raman feature at $~$ 239 $cm^{-1}$ in S$_2$ suggests fewer disordered GeTe$_{4-n}$Ge$_n$ tetrahedra, correlating with reduced Ge-Ge bonding signatures. Machine-Learned Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations show dominant Te contributions below 100 $cm^{-1}$, while Ge dominates above, particularly influencing the 120 $cm^{-1}$ mode affected by defects at the Ge-site. Complementary calculation of phonon linewidth via MLMD and Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) methods affirm the predominance of three-phonon scattering below 300 K. Specific heat measurements, modeled using Debye-Einstein formalism, show lower Debye temperatures ($\theta_D$) of 172.3 $\pm$ 1.5 K in Ge$_{0.8}$Te and 176.6 $\pm$ 1.7 K for Ge$_{0.88}$Te respectively, confirming defect-induced lattice softening. Electrical resistivity analysis further corroborates this, indicating reduced effective phonon frequencies in $S_1$. Thus, our results establish that higher Ge vacancies lead to softer, and hence more anharmonic lattice dynamics in GeTe, with its relevance in designing superior thermoelectric and phase-change memory applications.</p>

            <h2>Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home when Doubled and Scaled</h2>

            <p>The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kamran Behnia</p>
            <p>In a growing list of insulators, experiments find that magnetic field induces a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various insulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of peak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a scenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins by noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary scattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic field. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not cancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase and generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength, $\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$. The derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</p>

            <h2>Scaling laws of shrinkage induced fragmentation phenomena</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roland Szatmári, Akio Nakahara, So Kitsunezaki, Ferenc Kun</p>
            <p>We investigate the shrinkage induced breakup of thin layers of heterogeneous materials attached to a substrate, a ubiquitous natural phenomenon with a wide range of potential applications. Focusing on the evolution of the fragment ensemble, we demonstrate that the system has two distinct phases: damage phase, where the layer is cracked, however, a dominant piece persists retaining the structural integrity of the layer, and a fragmentation phase, where the layer disintegrates into numerous small pieces. Based on finite size scaling we show that the transition between the two phases occurs at a critical damage analogous to continuous phase transitions. At the critical point a fully connected crack network emerges whose structure is controlled by the strength of adhesion to the substrate. In the strong adhesion limit, damage arises from random microcrack nucleation, resembling bond percolation, while weak adhesion facilitates stress concentration and the growth of cracks to large extensions. The critical exponents of the damage to fragmentation transition agree to a reasonable accuracy with those of two-dimensional bond percolation. Our findings provide a novel insight into the mechanism of shrinkage-induced cracking revealing generic scaling laws of the phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industrial applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films or surface layers. However, real-world processing applications mostly are concerned with bulk materials, which prevents the use of x-ray surface based techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast x-ray dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon laser excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of thetemporal evolution of ultrafast distorted lattice depth profiles. We demonstrate the potential of UDD by studying a thin Si single crystal upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation. Our study reveals that below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions not only longitudinal, but also transversal to the propagation of the strain wave appear on picosecond time scales along the single crystal. The observation of this transversal deformation after laser excitation contradicts previous work that were not able to observed it, what could be related to the high sensitivity of dynamical diffraction with respect to the lattice distortions. The speed of propagation of this ultrafast transversal strain deformation is observed to be slower to the longitudinal sound speed for Si as described in the bibliography.</p>

            <p>Can strong repulsive interactions be shown to give rise to pairing in a controlled way? We find that for a single flavor polarized band, there is a small expansion parameter in the low density limit, once the Bloch wavefunction form factor is taken into account. A perturbative expansion is possible, even if the interaction is much stronger than the Fermi energy $\epsilon_F$. As a matter of principle, our work shows analytically how strong pairing can emerge from strong repulsion. We illustrate our method with two examples: a 2D Dirac model and a 1D tight binding model with two orbitals. In the latter case, using density matrix renormalization group, we show that the analytical theory indeed guided us to discover the parameter regime where p-wave pairing with order-1 strength is dominant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori</p>
            <p>It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has the desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors from several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation remain small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <p>We experimentally study the heterogeneity of strain in a granular medium subjected to oscillatory shear in a rotating drum. Two complementary methods are used. The first method relies on optical imaging and grain tracking, allowing us to compute some components of the strain tensor and their variance. The second method, Diffusive Acoustic Wave Spectroscopy (DAWS), provides the quadratic strain within the bulk. Our results show that strain is spatially heterogeneous, with fluctuations about ten times larger than the mean, primarily dominated by variability at the grain scale. We then analyze in detail the strain fluctuations occurring during the forward and backward branches of the shear stress cycles, along with the intra-cycle plastic strain resulting from of each cycle. Both methods reveal that each shear cycle consists of two consecutive diffusive-like branches, and that the resulting plastic strain fluctuations scales with the mean plastic shear strain. We propose that plastic strain fluctuations result from irreversible strain heterogeneity that increases with applied shear -- reflected in forward--backward strain anticorrelations -- but is constrained by load-controlled induced memory.</p>

This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies in this field include deep learning, graph neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and automated generative models (GANs, VAEs). These approaches enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (AutoGluon, TPOT, and this http URL), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Gisti, David J. Luitz, Maxime Debertolis</p>
            <p>We extend the concept of operator charge in the context of an abelian U (1) symmetry and apply this framework to symmetry-preserving matrix product operators (MPOs), enabling the description of operators projected onto specific sectors of the corresponding symmetry. Leveraging this representation, we study the effect of interactions on the scrambling of information in an integrable Heisenberg spin chain, by controlling the number of particles. Our focus lies on out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) which we project on sectors with a fixed number of particles. This allows us to link the non-interacting system to the fully-interacting one by allowing more and more particle to interact with each other, keeping the interaction parameter fixed. While at short times, the OTOCs are almost not affected by interactions, the spreading of the information front becomes gradually faster and the OTOC saturate at larger values as the number of particle increases. We also study the behavior of finite-size systems by considering the OTOCs at times beyond the point where the front hits the boundary of the system. We find that in every sector with more than one particle, the OTOCs behave as if the local operator was rotated by a random unitary matrix, indicating that the presence of boundaries contributes to the maximal scrambling of local operators.</p>

In the presence of an additional temporal noise in the growth rates, a third partially localised phase is predicted theoretically, using results from Derrida's Random Energy Model. Such temporal fluctuations mitigate concentration effects, but do not make them disappear. We discuss our results in the context of population growth and wealth inequalities.</p>

We then propose a new model incorporating paired-phase gradient interlayer interactions to realize the BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic dimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal phase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond the conventional phase transition theory.</p>

            <h2>Ideal quantum geometry of the surface states of rhombohedral graphite and its effects on the surface superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guodong Jiang, Tero Heikkilä, Päivi Törmä</p>
            <p>The interplay of quantum geometry and interactions determines the correlated state properties of flat bands. Here, we investigate the ideal quantum geometry (IQG), i.e., the property that the trace of quantum metric equals the Berry curvature, in the surface flat bands of rhombohedrally stacked graphene (RG) multilayers. We show that RG represents a class of semimetals with IQG, among which only RG has a nonvanishing IQG at the center of the surface bands. In the presence of long-range hoppings, a displacement field polarizes the electron density to one of the two surfaces, stabilizing the IQG and boosting transitions to correlated phases like superconductivity. Analyzing the superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state in a many-layer RG, we reveal a heavy-fermion picture where the "heavy electrons" carry a nonzero supercurrent. This unusual behavior arises from the IQG of the surface states, which suggests a large fraction of supercurrent running on the surface of RG.</p>

            <h2>Exact large-scale correlations in diffusive systems with general interactions: explicit characterisation without the Dean--Kawasaki equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aurélien Grabsch, Davide Venturelli, Olivier Bénichou</p>
            <p>Characterising the statistical properties of classical interacting particle systems is a long-standing question. For Brownian particles the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean--Kawasaki equation. This equation remains mostly formal and linearization (or higher-order expansions) is required to obtain explicit expressions for physical observables, with a range of validity not easily defined. Here, by combining macroscopic fluctuation theory with equilibrium statistical mechanics, we provide a systematic alternative to the Dean--Kawasaki framework to characterize large-scale correlations. This approach enables us to obtain explicit and exact results for dynamical observables such as tracer cumulants and bath-tracer correlations in one dimension, both in and out of equilibrium. In particular, we reveal a generic non-monotonic spatial structure in the response of the bath following a temperature quench. Our approach applies to a broad class of interaction potentials and extends naturally to higher dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory of correlations in hard rod gas</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anupam Kundu</p>
            <p>Recently, a theoretical framework known as {\it ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory} has been developed to study large-scale fluctuations and correlations in many-body systems exhibiting ballistic transport. In this paper, we review this theory in the context of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods. The initial configurations of the rods are sampled from a probability distribution characterised by slowly varying conserved density profiles across this http URL from a microscopic description, we first formulate the macroscopic fluctuation theory in terms of the phase-space density of quasiparticles. In the second part, we apply this framework to compute the two-point, two-time correlation functions of the conserved densities in the Euler scaling limit. We derive an explicit expression for the correlation function which not only reveals its inherent symmetries, but is also straightforward to evaluate numerically for a given initial state. Our results also recover known expressions for space-time correlations in equilibrium for the hard-rod gas.</p>

            <h2>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peiyi Chen, Qin Li, Gang Chen</p>
            <p>It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the cooling wall. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on an approximate quasi-continuum approach. This work examines this effect rigorously by studying evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Numerical results show that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, reaffirming the evaporative refrigeration effect. The present work further reveals that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. While the dominant mechanism is the asymmetry in the molecular distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules at the interface, additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion, similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. The impacts of key parameters, including liquid thickness, Knudsen number, and accommodation coefficient, are investigated. The numerical simulation shows that with a thicker vapor, a thinner liquid film, and a larger accommodation coefficient, leads to stronger evaporative refrigeration effect. This work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning, refrigeration, and membrane distillation.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study the free decay of a turbulent trapped Bose gas by analyzing the temporal evolution of density variations extracted from absorption images. We introduce a parameter $\delta$ as a simple and experimentally accessible observable that captures the amplitude of density variations. After the driving is turned off, this parameter exhibits a clear decay, which enabled us to identify a characteristic relaxation time. Interestingly, this timescale remains nearly constant across the range of excitation amplitudes explored, while the magnitude of $\delta$ varies with the injected energy. Numerical simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal a qualitatively similar behavior, both showing a decay of density variations over time.</p>

            <p>When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</p>

            <h2>An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> B. Siddani, Weiqun Zhang, Andrew Nonaka, John Bell, Ishan Srivastava</p>
            <p>The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.</p>

We present the dielectric function contributions from the infrared active modes as well as the Raman spectra and their polarization dependence.

Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier-based technique to optimize the duration of different evaporation stages constrained to have a fixed total duration; this enables the progressive creation of increasingly rapid experimental sequences that still generate high quality BECs.

            <p>Boron forms a wide variety of compounds with alkaline earth elements due to its unique bonding characteristics. Among these, binary compounds of Be and B display particularly rich structural diversity, attributed to the small atomic size of Be. Cubic BeB$_2$ is a particularly interesting phase, where Be donates electrons to stabilize a diamond-like boron network under high pressure. In this work, we employ \textit{ab initio} methods to conduct a detailed investigation of cubic BeB$_2$ and its functional properties. We show that this metastable phase is dynamically stable under ambient conditions, and its lattice match to existing substrate materials suggests possible epitaxial stabilization via thin-film growth routes. Through a comprehensive characterization of its electronic, transport, and superconductivity properties, we demonstrate that cubic BeB$_2$ exhibits high hole concentrations and high hole mobility, making it a potential candidate for efficient $p$-type transport. In addition, cubic BeB$_2$ is found to exhibit low-temperature superconductivity at degenerate doping levels, similar to several other doped covalent semiconductors such as diamond, Si, and SiC.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the anisotropic dispersion features of a two dimensional electron gas at the (110) oriented $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interfaces, as revealed by scanning gate microscopy of electronic flow from a quantum point contact. The dispersion relation of the (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ interface is characterized by a highly non-circular Fermi surface. Here, we develop an efficient tight-binding model for the electron gas at the interface. We show that the anisotropy of the Fermi surface causes both the direction of the electron flux from the quantum point contact and the periodicity of the self-interference conductance fringes to depend strongly on the orientation of the constriction relative to the crystal lattice. We show that the radially non-uniform distribution of the Fermi velocity on the Fermi surface results in skewing of electron trajectories when the quantum point contact gates are not aligned with the in-plane primitive vectors. We show that this effect results in the separation of electrons belonging to different orbitals for wide (110) $\mathrm{LaAlO}_3/\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ quantum wells.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satyen Dhamankar, Michael A. Webb</p>
            <p>Cononsolvency occurs when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for polymers over specific composition ranges, causing macroscopic phase separation or microscopic chain collapse. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between macroscopic and microscopic manifestations of cononsolvency remains unclear. A key challenge is identifying which interactions govern cononsolvency: coarse-grained analyses like standard Flory--Huggins models assume purely isotropic interactions, while atomistic simulations contain complex anisotropic interactions that cannot be precisely controlled or isolated. Here, we address the role of interaction anisotropy using the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, which yields $\chi$ as a thermodynamic average over both configurational and internal-state coarse-grained degrees of freedom. This enables controlled comparison between systems with isotropic versus orientation-dependent interactions that share identical effective $\chi$ parameters, either driving cononsolvency by strong solvent-cosolvent affinity or preferential polymer-cosolvent affinity. While pairs of systems exhibit equivalent macroscopic phase behavior, lattice Monte Carlo simulations reveal that those featuring orientation-dependent interactions generate distinct collapse signatures, particularly in reentrant coil-globule transitions or characteristics of the solvation structure. These results demonstrate how microscopic interactions influences cononsolvency behavior beyond what effective $\chi$ parameters alone predict.</p>

The magnetic order arises primarily from Fe atoms, whose strong ferromagnetic exchange induces moments on neighboring Ta sites. The large topological gap originates from a \emph{deep} $s$-$d$-type band inversion between spin-down Ta $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to $d$-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTa$X_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin-orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. Owing to its structural similarity to Fe$X$ superconductors and reduced net magnetization, FeTa$X_2$ further offers a promising platform for realizing chiral topological superconductivity. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.</p>

            <p>Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</p>

A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</p>

To address this, we introduce a multi-shifted biconjugate gradient algorithm that exploits the shared structure of Krylov subspaces across spectra with varying incident energies, effectively reducing the computational complexity to that of linear spectroscopies. Both mathematical proofs and numerical benchmarks confirm that this algorithm substantially accelerates spectral simulations, achieving constant complexity independent of the number of incident energies, while ensuring accuracy and stability.

            <p>Chains of Rydberg atoms have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum physics. This success originates from the precise control of lattice geometries provided by optical tweezers, which allows access to a wide range of synthetic quantum phases. Experiments on one-dimensional arrays have stimulated tremendous progress in understanding quantum phase transitions into crystalline phases. However, the finite width of tweezers introduces small variations in interatomic distances, leading to quenched disorder in the interactions. In this letter, we numerically study how such disorder alters the nature of two critical regimes observed in experiments. Firstly, following experimental protocols, we analyze Kibble-Zurek dynamics and find a crossover from the clean Ising transition to the infinite-randomness fixed point as system size and disorder strength increase. Secondly, we show that the floating phase (an incommensurate Luttinger liquid phase emerging at stronger interactions) is localized by the disorder, yet preserves short-range incommensurate correlations with the same leading wave vector. Our results clearly reveal an additional technical challenge in the scalability of Rydberg-based quantum simulators.</p>

The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role in discussion on their behaviors.

INQ is a specially designed software to efficiently solve the real-time TDDFT equations on graphics processing units (GPUs), which aim to overcome the computational limitation of time and size scales of non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this work we will present an implementation of non-collinear TDDFT for the INQ code to simulate spin dynamics in real time and discuss the implementation of non-collinear magnetic effects into the code. We will discuss the implementation of exchange-correlation magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the interaction between the electronic system and external magnetic fields. We will then consider several prototypical examples of spin dynamics in magnetic clusters and solids after light excitation.

            <p>The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission and scanning tunneling microscopy, while recent magnetotransport observations yield evidence for the existence of hole pockets of fractional area $p/8$, where $p$ is the doping density. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.</p>

Using nonlinear response theory, we derive their time-domain expressions linear in the pulse amplitude, revealing that not only the electric field but also its time derivative contributes to $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$. Furthermore, even when the time-derivative component is negligible, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can be in antiphase with the pulsed field and thus with $\Delta P$. These theoretical predictions are further supported by real-time simulations of a model for electronic ferroelectrics. Our results demonstrate that the commonly assumed relation $\Delta P \propto \Delta I_{\mathrm{SH}}$ can break down under certain conditions, reflecting the complex-valued and frequency-dependent nature of nonlinear dynamical susceptibilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siwei Zhang, Weijun Yuan, Niccolò Bigagli, Haneul Kwak, Tijs Karman, Ian Stevenson, Sebastian Will</p>
            <p>Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude, we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.</p>

            <h2>Gradient-based grand canonical optimization enabled by graph neural networks with fractional atomic existence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mads-Peter Verner Christiansen, Bjørk Hammer</p>
            <p>Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for materials science, enabling the study of larger systems and longer timescales. State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.</p>

            <h2>Multiple Topological Phases Controlled via Strain in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zesen Fu, Mengli Hu, Aolin Li, Haiming Duan, Junwei Liu, Fangping Ouyang</p>
            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) are an emergent class of magnetic materials that combine properties of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, exhibiting spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and zero net magnetic moment due to combined time-reversal and crystal symmetry. Here, we construct a Kondo-lattice model on a two-dimensional square Lieb lattice to investigate the topological properties of AMs. We identify a type-II quantum spin Hall state characterized by spin-polarized counterpropagating edge states. Breaking the $C_{4z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, which connects magnetic sublattices, induces a transition to a quantum anomalous Hall state. We further establish a strain-induced mechanism to control these topological phase transitions and present the corresponding phase diagram. Finally, we demonstrate the predicted transitions in monolayer CrO, a realistic altermagnetic candidate, using first-principles calculations. Our findings highlight the potential of 2D AMs as a versatile platform for topological spintronics, enabling strain-tunable helical and chiral edge states within a single system.</p>

            <h2>EAC-Net: Predicting real-space charge density via equivariant atomic contributions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuejian Qin, Taoyuze Lv, Zhicheng Zhong</p>
            <p>Charge density is central to density functional theory (DFT), as it fully defines the ground-state properties of a material system. Obtaining it with high accuracy is a computational bottleneck. Existing machine learning models are constrained by trade-offs among accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Here, we introduce the Equivariant Atomic Contribution Network (EAC-Net), which couples atoms and grids to integrate the strengths of grid-based and basis-function frameworks. EAC-Net achieves high accuracy (typically below 1% error), enhanced efficiency, and strong generalization across complex systems. Building on this framework, we develop EAC-mp, a universal charge density model covering the periodic table. The model demonstrates robust zero-shot performance across diverse systems, and generalizes beyond the training distribution, supporting downstream applications such as band structure calculations. By linking local chemical environments to charge densities, EAC-Net provides a scalable framework for accelerating electronic structure prediction and enabling high-throughput materials discovery.</p>

            <h2>Intertwined Electron Pairing in the Bilayer Two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard Model: a Unified Picture of Two Superconductivities in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi-cong Mo, Yao-yuan Zheng, Wéi Wú</p>
            <p>The mechanism of superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ bulk and film superconductors remains actively debated. Here, we investigate the bilayer two-orbital Kanamori-Hubbard model for $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ using cellular dynamical mean-field theory. We discover two intertwined $s_{\pm}-$ wave superconductivities with distinct physical origins. We show that when the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is under-doped, electron pairing associated to Hund's coupling $J_H$ prevails. As $d_{z^2}$ hole-doping $\delta_z$ increases, a second superconductivity, which is largely insensitive to $J_H$ but exhibiting a critical reliance on the $d_{z^2}$ - $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hybridization $V$, arises. These two primary pairing states exhibit comparable maximum transition temperatures $T_c$, and evolve from one to the other following a smooth $T_c$ versus $\delta_z$ relation. A stark particle-hole asymmetry is observed in the superconducting phase diagram, indicating the crucial role played by the $\gamma-$ band of $d_{z^2}$ orbital in pairing. Our results present a picture unifying the two possible pairing mechanisms in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ superconductors. We discuss the implications of our findings to recent experiments.</p>

            <h2>Molecular augmented dynamics: Generating experimentally consistent atomistic structures by design</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tigany Zarrouk, Miguel A. Caro</p>
            <p>A fundamental objective of materials modeling is identifying atomic structures that align with experimental observables. Conventional approaches for disordered materials involve sampling from thermodynamic ensembles and hoping for an experimental match. This process is inefficient and offers no guarantee of success. We present a method based on modified molecular dynamics, that we call molecular augmented dynamics (MAD), which identifies structures that simultaneously match multiple experimental observables and exhibit low energies as described by a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) trained from ab-initio data. We demonstrate its feasibility by finding representative structures of glassy carbon, nanoporous carbon, ta-C, a-C:D and a-CO$_x$ that match their respective experimental observables -- X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, pair distribution function and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data -- using the same initial structure and underlying MLP. The method is general, accepting any experimental observable whose simulated counterpart can be cast as a function of differentiable atomic descriptors. This method enables a computational "microscope" into experimental structures.</p>

            <h2>Transient localization from fractionalization: vanishingly small heat conductivity in gapless quantum magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Feng, Penghao Zhu, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.</p>

            <p>For equilibrium hard spheres the stochastic geometry of the insertion space, the room to accommodate another sphere, relates exactly to the equation of state. We begin to extend this idea to active matter, analyzing insertion space for repulsive active particles in one and two dimensions using both on- and off-lattice models. In 1D we derive closed-form expressions for the mean insertion cavity size, cavity number, and total insertion volume, all in excellent agreement with simulations. Strikingly, activity increases the total insertion volume and tends to keep the insertion space more connected. These results provide the first quantitative foundation for the stochastic geometry of active matter, and opens up a new route to building a thermodynamics of active systems.</p>

            <h2>Odd-parity longitudinal magnetoconductivity in time-reversal symmetry broken materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sunit Das, Akash Adhikary, Divya Sahani, Aveek Bid, Amit Agarwal</p>
            <p>Magnetotransport measurements are a sensitive probe of symmetry and electronic structure in quantum materials. While conventional metals exhibit longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity} (OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture. Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals.</p>

            <h2>Effective delocalization in the one-dimensional Anderson model with stealthy disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Vanoni, Boris L. Altshuler, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>We study analytically and numerically the Anderson model in one dimension with "stealthy" disorder, defined as having a power spectrum that vanishes in a continuous band of wave numbers. Motivated by recent studies on the optical transparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the localization length via the perturbation theory expansion of the self-energy. We find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength $W$, there exists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\chi$ for which the localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of "effective delocalization" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that spans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of stealthy systems. Unlike uncorrelated disorder, for which the localization length $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2}$ to leading order for small W, the leading order terms in the perturbation expansion of $\xi$ for stealthy disordered systems vanish identically for a progressively large number of terms as $\chi$ increases such that $\xi$ scales as $W^{-2n}$ with arbitrarily large $n$. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical simulations. Our results may serve as a first step in investigating the role of stealthy disorder in quantum systems, which is of both theoretical and experimental relevance.</p>

            <p>We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</p>

            <h2>Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dimitrios Charamis, Manas Kulkarni, Jorge Kurchan, Laura Foini</p>
            <p>The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</p>

            <p>Platinum-coated polystyrene Janus particles exhibit a combination of stochastic and deterministic motion in hydrogen peroxide solutions, making them promising candidates for applications in micro-scale cargo transport, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. The dynamics of Janus particles very near a boundary are dictated by conservative and non-conservative interactions that depend on particle, substrate, and solution properties. This study investigated the influence of orientational quenching by measuring the effect of changes in cap thickness and hydrogen peroxide concentration on particle velocity and maximum displacement. Janus particles with cap thicknesses of 3 nm, 7 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, and 35 nm were analyzed in 1 wt./vol.% and 3 wt./vol.% hydrogen peroxide solutions near the bottom and top boundaries of the fluid cell. Results indicated that particles with lower cap thicknesses exhibit higher velocities, with faster particles in 3 wt./vol.% peroxide as compared to 1 wt./vol.% peroxide. Furthermore, results suggest a combined influence of activity and gravitational effects influenced whether particles moved along the top boundary i.e. ceiling or bottom boundary i.e. flooring. Heavier cap particles in lower peroxide concentration solution show less ceiling than lighter cap particles in higher peroxide concentration. We also find a global reduction in velocity for when a single surface of the two is plasma cleaned surface. These findings highlight the important interplay between cap weight, hydrodynamic interactions, and propulsion force in determining the dynamics of Janus particles.</p>

            <p>Granular material has significant implications for industrial and geophysical processes. A long-lasting challenge, however, is seeking a unified rheology for its solid- and liquid-like behaviors under quasi-static, inertial, and even unsteady shear conditions. Here, we present a data-driven framework to discover the hidden governing equation of sheared granular materials. The framework, PINNSR-DA, addresses noisy discrete particle data via physics-informed neural networks with sparse regression (PINNSR) and ensures dimensional consistency via machine learning-based dimensional analysis (DA). Applying PINNSR-DA to our discrete element method simulations of oscillatory shear flow, a general differential equation is found to govern the effective friction across steady and transient states. The equation consists of three interpretable terms, accounting respectively for linear response, nonlinear response and energy dissipation of the granular system, and the coefficients depends primarily on a dimensionless relaxation time, which is shorter for stiffer particles and thicker flow layers. This work pioneers a pathway for discovering physically interpretable governing laws in granular systems and can be readily extended to more complex scenarios involving jamming, segregation, and fluid-particle interactions.</p>

Using a high-throughput flux method, we obtained (111)-oriented hexagonal Mn_3Ir single crystals. A small AHE signal was detected, which we attribute to the coexistence of A- and B-type antiferromagnetic domains that mutually cancel the net AHE response. Our results reveal key aspects of the intrinsic magnetic properties and AHE in bulk Mn_3Ir, providing a critical material platform for the development of advanced spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Tantardini</p>
            <p>Standard ways of locating and characterizing Weyl points--Berry-flux integrals on small spheres and local $k\cdot p$ fits--are topologically sound but depend on user choices (sphere center/radius, gauge smoothing, surface charting, and Pauli-frame transport) that complicate high-throughput workflows. We introduce a local, basis-free criterion that avoids these knobs by using the octonionic geometry of $\operatorname{Im}\mathbb{O}\cong\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we build a unit octonion field $u(\mathbf{k})$ and its octonionic connection $\mathcal{A}_i=\operatorname{Im}(\bar u\,\partial_{k_i}u)$. Contracting the three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$-invariant three-form produces a pseudoscalar density whose sign gives the node's chirality. A companion quantity--the octonionic associator--vanishes at leading order precisely when the local three directions close inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane; its smallness thus provides an intrinsic, pointwise self-consistency check that the two-band reduction is valid. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge seams. In the linear regime the density reduces to the oriented volume set by the velocity matrix, thereby agreeing with the Chern number on a small sphere and with the chirality obtained from a $k\cdot p$ linearization. We outline a practical stencil-based algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and demonstrate robustness to benign numerical choices, while providing an intrinsic warning signal near band entanglement or multi-fold touchings.</p>

            <p>Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that exceed 1000, we show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.</p>

We show that PC symmetry quantizes the spin-CS action to $\{0,2\pi\}$ with $4\pi$ periodicity, thereby yielding a well-defined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. This invariant is additive under direct sums of isolated band structures, reduces to a known $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index when a global Takagi factorization exists, and in general depends on the choice of spin structure. Finally, we demonstrate lattice models in which this newly introduced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant distinguishes topological phases that cannot be detected by the previously known topological indices.</p>

However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored.

Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</p>

            <p>Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.</p>

            <p>Accurate understanding and control of interfacial adhesion between Cu and Ta$_x$N diffusion barriers are essential for ensuring the mechanical reliability and integrity of Cu interconnect systems in semiconductor devices. Amorphous tantalum nitride (a-Ta$_x$N) barriers are particularly attractive due to their superior barrier performance, attributed to the absence of grain boundaries. However, a systematic atomistic investigation of how varying Ta stoichiometries influences adhesion strength at Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces remains lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of interface optimization strategies. In this study, we employ machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces. We simultaneously evaluate three distinct interface construction approaches--static relaxation, high-temperature annealing, and simulated Cu deposition--to comprehensively investigate their influence on adhesion strength across varying Ta compositions ($x=1, 2, 4$). Peak force and work of adhesion values from SMD simulations quantitatively characterize interface strength, while atomic stress and strain analyses elucidate detailed deformation behavior, highlighting the critical role of interfacial morphologies. Additionally, we explore the atomistic mechanisms underlying cohesive failure, revealing how targeted incorporation of Ta atoms into Cu layers enhances the cohesive strength of the interface. This study demonstrates how MLIP-driven simulations can elucidate atomic-scale relationships between interface morphology and adhesion behavior, providing insights that can guide future atomistic engineering strategies toward enhancing intrinsic barrier adhesion, potentially enabling liner-free interconnect technologies.</p>

            <h2>Dimer-driven multiple reentrant localization with composite potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Jie Chang, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.</p>

            <h2>Extending the optical absorption in a lumped element meander structure to far-infrared wavelengths</h2>

            <p>Superconducting radiation detectors typically exhibit detection and single photon sensitivity limited to the mid infrared wavelength range. Extending their detection capabilities into the far infrared range (>10 um) requires careful selection of substrate materials and detector geometries. The overall detection efficiency is linked to absorption and coupling efficiencies. In this study, the resonator geometry and absorption efficiency were estimated using electromagnetic simulations in CST Microwave Studio for a lumped-element meander structure. Simulations were performed for the 12 to 50 um wavelength range, corresponding to the Infrared Free Electron Laser (IR FEL) at RRCAT, Indore. Absorption in the meander inductor was influenced by the substrate material, thickness, and impedance matching between the detector and incident photon medium. The results indicate that SiO2 and diamond substrates are suitable for developing lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKID) in this range. Optimized meander geometries on diamond substrates demonstrated absorption efficiencies of up to 95% for narrow bandwidths and over 50% for wide bandwidths. A 30-pixel LEKID structure was fabricated using electron beam lithography on a 500 um SiO2 coated Si substrate, with a 20 nm thick Ti40V60 alloy resonator. Experimental absorption efficiency was determined through transmission and reflection measurements. Results show that in the 14 to 26 um IR-FEL range, the LEKID achieved up to 75% absorption efficiency. These studies demonstrate that the LEKID structure is ideal for detecting far infrared wavelengths above 10 um, with high absorption efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Non-diagonal open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains by separation of variables: Complete spectrum and matrix elements of some quasi-local operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Niccoli</p>
            <p>The integrable quantum models, associated to the transfer matrices of the 6-vertex reflection algebra for spin 1/2 representations, are studied in this paper. In the framework of Sklyanin's quantum separation of variables (SOV), we provide the complete characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the transfer matrix and the proof of the simplicity of the transfer matrix spectrum. Moreover, we use these integrable quantum models as further key examples for which to develop a method in the SOV framework to compute matrix elements of local operators. This method has been introduced first in [1] and then used also in [2], it is based on the resolution of the quantum inverse problem (i.e. the reconstruction of all local operators in terms of the quantum separate variables) plus the computation of the action of separate covectors on separate vectors. In particular, for these integrable quantum models, which in the homogeneous limit reproduce the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions, we have obtained the SOV-reconstructions for a class of quasi-local operators and determinant formulae for the covector-vector actions. As consequence of these findings we provide one determinant formulae for the matrix elements of this class of reconstructed quasi-local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates.</p>

            <h2>Certifying quantum enhancements in thermal machines beyond the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José A. Almanza-Marrero, Gonzalo Manzano</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. Introducing a comparison with classical machines using the same set of thermodynamic resources, we show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage under mild conditions. This advantage applies to both cases where the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators: the three-level amplifier, the three-qubit autonomous refrigerator, and a noise-induced-coherence machine.</p>

            <h2>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a violations of the Goldbach conjecture, with driven atoms in tailored potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oleksandr V. Marchukov, Andrea Trombettoni, Giuseppe Mussardo, Maxim Olshanii</p>
            <p>The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p^{\text{(I)}}$ and $p^{\text{(II)}}$. In this article we propose a quantum analogue device that solves the following problem: given a small prime $p^{\text{(I)}}$, identify a member $N$ of a $\mathcal{N}$-strong set even numbers for which $N-p^{\text{(I)}}$ is also a prime. A table of suitable large primes $p^{\text{(II)}}$ is assumed to be known a priori. The device realizes the Grover quantum search protocol and as such ensures a $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}$ quantum advantage. Our numerical example involves a set of 51 even numbers just above the highest even classical-numerically explored so far [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation {\bf 83}, 2033 (2013)]. For a given small prime number $p^{\text{(I)}}=223$, it took our quantum algorithm 5 steps to identify the number $N=4\times 10^{18}+14$ as featuring a Goldbach partition involving $223$ and another prime, namely $p^{\text{(II)}}=4\times 10^{18}-239$. Currently, our algorithm limits the number of evens to be tested simultaneously to $\mathcal{N} \sim \ln(N)$: larger samples will typically contain more than one even that can be partitioned with the help of a given $p^{\text{(I)}}$, thus leading to a departure from the Grover paradigm.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Katsekpor, Latévi M. Lawson, Prince K. Osei, Ibrahim Nonkané</p>
            <p>Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Keup, Lenka Zdeborová</p>
            <p>This work explores multi-modal inference in a high-dimensional simplified model, analytically quantifying the performance gain of multi-modal inference over that of analyzing modalities in isolation. We present the Bayes-optimal performance and recovery thresholds in a model where the objective is to recover the latent structures from two noisy data matrices with correlated spikes. The paper derives the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for this model and characterizes its performance in the high-dimensional limit via the associated state evolution. The analysis holds for a broad range of priors and noise channels, which can differ across modalities. The linearization of AMP is compared numerically to the widely used partial least squares (PLS) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods, which are both observed to suffer from a sub-optimal recovery threshold.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> István Gábor Márián, Andrea Trombettoni, István Nándori</p>
            <p>In this paper we discuss and revisit the finite temperature extension of the renormalization group (RG) treatment of $T=0$ field theories, focusing as a case study on the $\phi^4$ model. We first discuss the extension of RG equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way by resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies and fixing the physical temperature parameter $T$. We show that this approach, although useful for a variety of applications, may lead to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow. Since the identification of fixed points is key in the study of classical and quantum phase transitions, wepropose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimensionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the quantum and classical phase diagrams of the Ising model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guri K. Buza, Toshali Mitra, Alexander Soloviev</p>
            <p>We determine the behavior of an out-of-equilibrium superfluid, composed of a $U(1)$ Goldstone mode coupled to hydrodynamic modes in a M\" uller-Israel-Stewart theory, in expanding backgrounds relevant to heavy ion collision experiments and cosmology. For suitable initial conditions, the evolution of the hydrodynamic variables leads to a change in the potential of the Goldstone mode, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. After some time, the condensate becomes small, leading the system evolution to be well described via hydrodynamic attractors for a timescale that we determine in Bjorken and Gubser flows. We define this new timescale as the \textit{attractor time} and show its dependence on initial conditions. In the case of the Gubser flow, we provide for the first time a complete description of the nonlinear evolution of the system, including a novel nonlinear regime of constant anisotropy not found in the Bjorken evolution. Finally, we consider the superfluid in the dynamical FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker) background, where we observe a similar attractor behavior, dependent on the initial conditions, that at late times approaches a regime dominated by the condensate.</p>

In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.</p>

            <p>The Dicke-Ising model, one of the few paradigmatic models of matter-light interaction, exhibits a superradiant quantum phase transition above a critical coupling strength. However, in natural optical systems, its experimental validation is hindered by a "no-go theorem''.

We analyze the system's free energy landscape using field-theoretical methods and develop a digital-analog quantum algorithm that disentangles qubit and photon degrees of freedom through a parity-measurement protocol. This disentangling enables the emulation of a photonic Schrödinger cat state, which is a hallmark of the superradiant ground state in finite-size systems and can be unambiguously probed through the Wigner tomography of the resonator's field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaibhav Sharma, Kaden R. A. Hazzard</p>
            <p>Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is an important avenue to gain insights into both particle physics phenomena and constrained quantum many-body dynamics. There is a growing interest in probing analogs of high energy collision phenomena in lattice gauge theories that can be implemented on current quantum simulators. Motivated by this, we characterize the confined mesons that originate from a local high energy excitation in a particle-conserving 1D $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. We focus on a simple, experimentally accessible setting that does not require preparation of colliding wavepackets and isolates the effects of gauge field confinement strength and initial state energy on the nature of propagating excitations. We find that the dynamics is characterized by the propagation of a superposition of differently sized mesons. The linear confinement leads to meson size oscillations in time. The average meson size and oscillation frequency are controlled by the strength of the gauge field confinement. At a constant confinement field, the average meson length is controlled by the initial excitation's energy. Higher energies produce longer mesons and their effective mass depends strongly on their size: longer mesons propagate more slowly out of the central excitation. Mesons of different sizes get spatially filtered with time due to different speeds. We show that this phenomenology is a consequence of linear confinement and remains valid in both the strong and weak confinement limit. We present simple explanations of these phenomena supported by exact numerics.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that quantum Lyapunov control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.</p>

            <p>Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, we propose the concept of spatially-controlled planar guided crystallization, a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low-loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM-based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non-volatile optical phase-shifter exploiting a silicon nitride-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure optically uniform crystalline properties across devices is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non-volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated circuits.</p>

            <p>Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories, with c-functions derived from it serving as candidate measures of the effective number of degrees of freedom. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. In this work, we investigate entanglement c-functions in the context of holographic RG flows, with a particular focus on flows across dimensions induced by circle compactifications. We argue that in spacetime dimensions $d \geq 4$, standard constructions of c-functions, which rely on higher derivatives of the entanglement entropy of either a ball or a cylinder, generically lead to non-monotonic behavior. Working with known dual geometries, we argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicity in the infrared, although a fully monotonic ultraviolet extension remains elusive. Furthermore, motivated by entanglement entropy inequalities, we conjecture a bound on the cylinder entanglement c-function, which holds in all our examples.</p>

            <p>The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation.</p>

QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</p>

            <p>Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na, Cl, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond approximately 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an empirical model inspired by the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, for example surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</p>

In this paper, a fully quantum derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the material electric polarization and show that a four-wave mixing-like correlated SaS scattering appears in the first order of perturbation and completely characterizes the non-resonant SaS photon pair production. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.</p>

            <p>We present a rigorous method to reduce the three-dimensional (3D) description of a quantum dot in silicon to an effective two-dimensional (2D) envelope function theory for electron spin qubits. By systematically integrating out the strongly confined vertical dimension using a Born-Oppenheimer-inspired ansatz at the envelope-function level, we derive an effective in-plane potential that faithfully captures the essential electrostatics of the full 3D system. Considering the lowest two eigenstates of the out-of-plane direction, this reduction leads to the natural and explicit emergence of the valley degree of freedom within a 2D formalism, which is derived here from first principles. We validate the accuracy of the method through comparisons with full 3D simulations and demonstrate its superiority over naive 2D slicing, particularly in the presence of interface roughness. Crucially, the reduction in dimensionality leads to substantial computational savings, making our approach particularly well suited for simulating two-electron systems, e.g., for the extraction of parameters such as the exchange coupling. Beyond its practical utility, the rigorous 2D envelope function theory that is introduced in this study incorporates valley physics in a physically grounded manner, offering conceptual clarity on the role of valley states in qubit operation and measurement.</p>

Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction. However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose that this decodability transition is universal across various settings, including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.</p>

            <h2>High-harmonic spectroscopy of mobility edges in one-dimensional quasicrystals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> H. K. Avetissian, B. R. Avchyan, A. Brown, G. F. Mkrtchian</p>
            <p>Quasicrystals occupy a unique position between periodic and disordered systems, where localization phenomena such as Anderson transitions and mobility edges can emerge even in the absence of disorder. This distinctive behavior motivates the development of robust, all-optical diagnostic tools capable of probing the structural, topological, and dynamical properties of such systems. In this work, focusing on generalized Aubry-André-Harper models and on an incommensurate potential in the continuum limit, we demonstrate that high-harmonic generation phenomenon serves as a powerful probe of localization transitions and mobility edges in quasicrystals. We introduce a new parameter--dipole mobility--which captures the impact of intraband dipole transitions and enables classification of nonlinear optical regimes, where excitation and high-harmonic generation yield can differ by orders of magnitude. We show that the cutoff frequency of harmonics is strongly influenced by the position of the mobility edge, providing a robust and experimentally accessible signature of localization transitions in quasicrystals.</p>

            <h2>Enhancement of Weak Interactions in Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. V. Flambaum</p>
            <p>Weak interactions cause small parity-violating energy differences between left- and right-handed chiral systems. Although normally tiny, these effects may be significantly enhanced during collective phenomena such as phase transitions. We propose a theoretical model describing the enhancement of weak interactions in phase transitions. The enhancement factor is proportional to the critical number of atoms, $N_c$, in the nucleus of the new phase. After the nucleus reaches its critical size, it grows until it fills the entire system. Measurement of the ratio of produced left and right chiral structures may provide a way to measure this critical number $N_c$. Experiments where definite spin-chiral structures are formed during a phase transition in crossed electric and magnetic fields, indicate $N_c \sim 10^9 - 10^{10}$. An open question is whether a similar enhancement could operate during cosmological phase transitions - thereby boosting CP-violating effects sufficiently to contribute to the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry (baryogenesis).</p>

            <p>The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</p>

            <h2>From Phenomenology to a Nonlinear Model of Dynamic Snap-Through of an Elastica</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chiraprabha Bhattacharyya, Ramsharan Rangarajan</p>
            <p>Rotating the clamped ends of a buckled elastica induces a snap-through instability. Predicting the limit point and determining the equilibria at the start and end of the snap are routine computations in the quasi-static setting. The instability itself, however, is dynamic, and quite violently so. We propose an energy-preserving nonlinear single degree of freedom model for this dynamic phenomenon in the case of a symmetrically deforming elastica. The model hinges on a surprising observation relating elastica profiles during the free dynamic snap with a specific sequence of geometrically-constrained elastic energy minimizing configurations. We corroborate this phenomenological observation over a significant range of arch depths through experiments and finite element simulations. The resulting model does not rely on modal expansions, explicit slowness assumptions, or linearization of the arch's kinematics. Instead, the model is effective because its solutions approximate the action integral well. The model provides distinctive computational benefits and new insights into the snap-through phenomenon. Our study is motivated by an application harnessing snap-through instabilities in submerged ribbons for underwater propulsion. We briefly describe its novel working principle and discuss its relationship to the problem studied.</p>

            <h2>Dimer-driven multiple reentrant localization with composite potential</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Jie Chang, Dong Ruan, Gui-Lu Long</p>
            <p>Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.</p>

            <p>Probabilistic bits (p-bits) are stochastic hardware elements whose output probability can be tuned by an input bias, offering a route to energy-efficient architectures that exploit, rather than suppress, fluctuations. Here we report p-bit generation in an organic memristive device, establishing polymers as the first class of soft-matter systems to realize probabilistic hardware. The active element is a dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DTP)-backbone polymer with pendant triphenylamine (TPA) groups, whose stochastic resistance fluctuations are converted into binary outputs by a simple voltage-divider/comparator circuit. The resulting probability distributions follow logistic transfer functions, characteristic of stochastic binary neurons. Separately, ensembles of pulsed IV measurements were analyzed to construct binned current distributions, from which the discrete Shannon entropy was calculated. Peaks in this entropy coincide with bias conditions that maximize variability in the memristor voltage drop, directly linking device-level stochasticity to intrinsic material properties. Dielectric analysis shows that pendant TPA units provide dynamically active relaxation modes, while energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that the frontier orbitals of DTP, TPA and ITO align within the transport gap to produce a bifurcated percolation network. The correspondence between microscopic relaxation dynamics, electronic energetics and macroscopic probabilistic response highlights how organic semiconductors can serve as chemically tunable entropy sources, opening a polymer-based pathway toward thermodynamic computing.</p>

            <h2>Transfer tensor analysis of localization in the Anderson and Aubry-André-Harper models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michelle C. Anderson, Chern Chuang</p>
            <p>We use the transfer tensor method to analyze localization and transport in simple disordered systems, specifically the Anderson and Aubry-André-Harper models. Emphasis is placed on the memory effects that emerge when ensemble-averaging over disorder, even when individual trajectories are strictly Markovian. We find that memory effects are necessary to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called "outgoing-pseudoflux". This work establishes connections between theoretical research on dynamical maps and Markovianity and localization phenomena in physically realizable model systems.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Hall effect describes the generation of a transverse voltage by a longitudinal current even in the absence of an external magnetic field. While typically observed in ferromagnets, it has also been predicted to arise in altermagnets, materials characterized by rotational symmetries that enable broken time reversal symmetry despite compensated collinear magnetic ordering. These symmetries enforce band (anti)crossings that can generate significant contributions to the Berry curvature that drives the anomalous Hall effect. This Berry curvature is predicted to exhibit a characteristic multipolar order, resulting in a symmetry-enforced distribution at or near net compensation which is highly sensitive to perturbations that distort this balance. However, exploring the predicted multipolar Berry curvature of altermagnets and its reversible manipulation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate evidence for the multipolar nature of the altermagnetic Berry curvature in MnTe by tuning the anomalous Hall effect via uniaxial stress. Upon straining, the magnitude of the anomalous Hall conductivity changes and, at a critical strain of 0.14%, the sign is reversed. Symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that this tunability is a direct consequence of the altermagnetic multipolar Berry curvature. Our results provide insight into the role of crystal and magnetic symmetries in the realization of higher-order Berry curvature distributions and their unique tunability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. B. Shi, Y. X. Zhang, S. W. Liu, Z. Song</p>
            <p>The dynamical balance of the pairing term plays a crucial role in the emergence of topological superconductivity in the p-wave spinless Kitaev chain, particularly in the non-Hermitian regime. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes.</p>

            <p>The interaction between electron spin and molecular chirality plays a fundamental role in quantum phenomena, with significant implications for spintronics and quantum computing. The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where chiral materials preferentially transmit electrons of a particular spin, has sparked intense interest and debate regarding its underlying mechanism. Despite extensive research, the spatial distribution of spin polarization in chiral systems, the key evidence to reveal the spin scattering mechanism in CISS, has remained experimentally elusive particularly due to complications arising from spin-orbit coupling in metal electrodes typically used in such studies. Here we show, through reflective magnetic circular dichroism measurements on chiral tellurium nanowires with graphene electrodes, that current-induced spin polarization exhibits identical signs in both the nanowire and electrodes, distinct from the presumed spin filter scenario. The observed spin polarization scales linearly with current amplitude, aligns parallel to the current direction, reverses with chirality or current flow, and demonstrates spin relaxation lengths of several micrometers into graphene. Our findings provide the first direct visualization of spatial spin distribution in chiral devices. This work establishes a new paradigm for investigating spin-dependent phenomena in chiral materials and opens avenues for developing chirality-based spintronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Pathways from a chiral superconductor to a composite Fermi liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunchao Zhang, Leyna Shackleton, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Recent experiments have reported chiral time-reversal broken superconductivity in $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene for $n = 4,5, 6$. Introducing a moiré potential by alignement with a hexagonal boron nitride substrate suppresses the superconductivity but leads instead to various fractional quantum anomalous Hall phenomena. Motivated by these observations, we consider the fate of the phase transition between (a chiral) Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) metal and a Composite Fermi Liquid (CFL) metal in the presence of attractive interactions. These are parent states, respectively, for the superconductor and the fractional quantum Hall states. For weak attractive interactions, the LFL is usually unstable to superconductivity while the CFL is stable. This raises the possibility of a direct continuous phase transition between the chiral superconductor and the CFL. However, we show that generically the LFL close to the transition to the CFL is stable against superconductivity. Thus the evolution between the CFL and chiral superconductor goes through an intermediate stable LFL phase for weak attractive interactions. With stronger interactions, the evolution can instead go through a non-Abelian paired quantum Hall state.</p>

            <h2>Strain-Induced Antiferromagnetic-to-Altermagnetic Phase Transition and Topology in $(\mathrm{CrO}_2)_1/(\mathrm{TaO}_2)_2$ Superlattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wanfei Shan, Qun Yang, Prineha Narang</p>
            <p>Topological aspects in altermagnets have come into focus recently, and tuning the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state into an altermagnetic phase remains an active frontier. We realize both within a rutile superlattice here in this paper. With first principles calculation, we show that a uniaxial strain of only 0.5$\%$ along the c axis converts the $(\mathrm{CrO}_2)_1/(\mathrm{TaO}_2)_2$ rutile superlattice from a trivial antiferromagnet into an altermagnet with topology accompanied by a weak SOC. The strain opens a spin-dependent band splitting of $\sim 1.1 eV$ and, despite the weak SOC together with in-plane magnetic moment orientation, generates an intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of order $10^3 S/cm$, comparable magnitude to that in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals. Tiny SOC here with in-plane \(\text{Néel}\) orientation gaps out the Weyl nodal rings, giving rise to 16 Weyl points in the superlattice. Thus, we point out a simple route toward strain and field tunable, low-dissipation altermagnetic electronics.</p>

            <p>The antiferromagnets with the time-reversal symmetry broken magnetic structures possess a finite spin splitting in the momentum space, and may contribute to a realization of a finite tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect even with magnets with zero net spin polarization. In this paper, we study the TMR effect with the noncollinear antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ whose inverse $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic order breaks the time-reversal symmetry. In particular, we employ the representative barrier material $\mathrm{MgO}$ as the tunnel insulator, and calculate the TMR effect in the $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}(01\bar{1}0)/\mathrm{MgO}(110)/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which has an optimal geometry for the spin-orbit torque switching of the magnetic configurations. We show that a finite TMR ratio reaching $\gtrsim 1000\%$ appears in the $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}/\mathrm{MgO}/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ MTJs, which is due to the spin splitting properties of $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ in the momentum space combined with the screening effect of $\mathrm{MgO}$.</p>

            <p>The quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), a hallmark of topological insulators, enables dissipationless, spin-polarized edge transport and has been predicted in various two-dimensional materials. However, challenges such as limited scalability, low-temperature operation, and the lack of robust electronic transport have hindered practical implementations. Here, we demonstrate the QSHE in an InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum well structure operating at elevated temperatures. This platform meets key criteria for device integration, including scalability, reproducibility, and tunability via electric field. When the Fermi level is positioned within the energy gap, we observe quantized resistance values independent of device length and in both local and nonlocal measurement configurations, confirming the QSHE. Helical edge transport remains stable up to T = 60 K, with further potential for higher-temperature operation. Our findings establish the InAs/GaInSb system as a promising candidate for integration into next-generation devices harnessing topological functionalities, advancing the development of topological electronics.</p>

            <p>Field induced assembly of reconfigurable structures with complex hierarchical configurations has recently become an area of intense research with the promise for exciting applications in programmable self-assembly and nano/microstructure fabrication. While a wide variety of structures, from crystals to glasses, to chains and oligomers have been produced by activating colloidal particles with electric and magnetic fields, a combined approach utilizing the capabilities of multiple field types offers a richer parameter space, enabling precise structural control and a higher degree of reconfigurability. Here we demonstrate the assembly of complex hierarchical colloidal superstructures using an electric field (AC) and magnetic field (DC) combination. In our chosen frequency regime, dipolar (magnetic and electric) and electrohydrodynamic interactions are comparable, leading to a rich phase space with a wide number of configurations which are tunable by relatively small changes of the field parameters. This is in contrast to the existing small number of studies on multi-field induced assembly that work in size and frequency regimes where the dominant mechanism is dipolar interaction induced assembly. We show that depending upon the direction and frequency of the applied fields, there can be three possibilities in structure formation: a) a cooperation among the fields b) a competition among the fields and c) hierarchical reorganization in which micrometer-sized particles form chains that are part of larger clusters or 'domains' spanning tens of micrometers. This versatile, easy to set up and fully reconfigurable approach of multi-field induced structure formation opens up new opportunities for bottom-up fabrication of smart materials, switchable photonic crystals, and modular microswimmers for targeted drug delivery and environmental remediation.</p>

            <p>In conventional transmon qubits, decoherence is dominated by a large number of parasitic two-level systems (TLS) residing at the edges of its large area coplanar shunt capacitor and junction leads. Avoiding these defects by improvements in design, fabrication and materials proved to be a significant challenge that so far led to limited progress. The merged-element transmon qubit (''mergemon''), a recently proposed paradigm shift in transmon design, attempts to address these issues by engineering the Josephson junction to act as its own shunt capacitor. With its energy mostly confined within the junctions, efforts required to improve qubit coherence can be concentrated on the junction barrier, a potentially easier to control interface compared to exposed circuit areas. Incorporating an additional aluminium deposition and oxidation into the in-situ bandaged Niemeyer-Dolan technique, we were able to fabricate flux-tunable mergemon qubits achieving mean $T_{1}$ relaxation times of up to $130\mu s$ ($Q \approx 3.3 \times 10^{6}$). TLS spectroscopy under applied strain and electric fields, together with systematic design variations, revealed that even for mergemon qubits - despite their significantly reduced footprint and increased junction barrier volume - careful design considerations are still essential to avoid coherence limitations due to surface loss.</p>

We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</p>

We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</p>

            <h2>Sharp Interface Dynamics in a Minimal Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Gomez, Yoichiro Mori, Sarah Strikwerda</p>
            <p>Interest in non-reciprocally coupled systems recently led to the introduction of a minimal non-reciprocally coupled Cahn-Hilliard (CH) model by Brauns and Marchetti in 2024 arXiv:2306.08868, which we refer to as the Brauns-Marchetti (BM) model. This model can be seen as a conservative counterpart to the spatially extended FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Lacking a gradient structure, the BM model was observed to exhibit interesting dynamics including traveling periodic wave-trains and other coherent structures, as well as spatiotemporal chaos in certain parameter regimes. In this paper, we derive an effective equation for the interface dynamics of solutions to the BM model in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in the sharp-interface limit. The resulting system of equations is a generalization of the classical Mullins-Sekerka (MS) equations, which we refer to as the modified MS equations. We show that the modified MS equation shares some properties with its classical counterpart, but importantly, it is not in general a length minimizing flow. To illustrate the utility of this asymptotic reduction in the sharp interface limit, we perform a detailed analysis of stationary and periodic wave-trains, systematically deriving expressions for wave-train speeds and stability thresholds. The methods used here should be applicable to other non-reciprocally coupled CH models and therefore provide another avenue for their more detailed analysis.</p>

            <h2>Statistical Advantage of Softmax Attention: Insights from Single-Location Regression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Duranthon, P. Marion, C. Boyer, B. Loureiro, L. Zdeborová</p>
            <p>Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation. Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear) remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with optimization by gradient-based algorithms.</p>

            <p>The oxidation of pure W and the sublimation of W oxide have been investigated to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant. Pure W has been oxidised at temperatures between 400 and 1050C and for durations ranging between 1 and 70 h. The formation of voids and cracks has been observed at temperatures above 600C, leading to the formation of dust or oxide spalling, which could be problematic in maintenance and waste-handling scenarios of a fusion power plant. Preferential oxidation taking place at the edge of the specimen was characterised, and its impact is discussed in relation to component design. Characterisation using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: the inner layer is 30-50 nm thick WO2 oxide, the middle layer is a 10-20 um of WO_2.72 and the outer layer is formed of WO2.9/WO3 phases - whose thickness varies according to the total thickness of the oxide scale. The observed microstructure is discussed in relation to the parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its potential impact on tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.</p>

            <h2>A Source of Deterministic Entanglement for Matter-Wave Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Li, RuGway Wu, Jörg Schmiedmayer</p>
            <p>We describe a deterministic and experimentally feasible protocol for generating entangled pairs of ultracold neutral atoms through controlled dissociation of diatomic Feshbach molecules. The dissociation process naturally produces nonlocal quantum correlations in spin, position-momentum, and path degrees of freedom, enabling the deterministic preparation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of massive particles and multiqubit states through hyperentangled encoding. Having each atom of the pair prepared in a matter waveguide, the scheme can be scaled to hundreds of parallel entanglement sources in an array connected to a matter wave optical network of beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometers, tunnel junctions and local detectors. The protocol builds on established techniques, including programmable optical potentials, high-fidelity single-particle control, single-molecule initialization, controlled molecular dissociation, and quantum gas microscopy with near-perfect detection, making it directly implementable with current technology. The proposed architecture naturally integrates with atomtronics circuits and chip-based matter-wave optics, offering a deterministic entanglement source for quantum nonlocality tests, precision metrology, and scalable neutral-atom quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kentaro Hino, Damyan S. Frantzov, Yuki Kurashige, Lewis M. Antill</p>
            <p>Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Multi-Qubit Gates by Dynamical Decoupling Implemented with IBMQ and 15NV Center in Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Tsunaki, Michael Dotan, Kseniia Volkova, Boris Naydenov</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a general protocol for realizing fast high-fidelity multi-qubit gates, through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. This way, we are able to control the states of the target qubits by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow error-prone direct control. The DD-gate protocol is developed and experimentally implemented within two distinct frameworks: a hardware-agnostic model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked within a general-purpose digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Likewise, we are able to thoroughly characterize the quantum mechanical dynamics behind the multi-qubit gates within IBMQ, without many of the experimental constraints faced by other quantum systems. While at the same time, we establish the protocol for the $^{15}$NV system, considering its specific properties. The DD-gates with $^{15}$NVs can represent a significant reduction in gate times and improved technological scalability, compared to current methods of target qubit control using dynamical decoupling. In addition, we propose a simple application of the method for high-efficiency polarization generation of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin. All experimental findings are supported by comprehensive open-source simulations in the two distinct frameworks. This work provides a robust hardware-agnostic strategy for quantum control, which can be implemented with arbitrary systems that fit the central-target qubits description. Thus, marking an essential step in technological scalability of future quantum devices.</p>

            <p>We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of an interval for the massless Dirac field in an inhomogeneous background on a segment where the same boundary condition at both its endpoints is imposed, and in its ground state. We focus on a class of metrics that are Weyl equivalent to the flat metric through a Weyl factor that depends only on the spatial coordinate. The explicit form of the entanglement Hamiltonian is written as the sum of a local and a bilocal term. The weight function of the local term allows us to study a contour function for the entanglement entropies. For the model obtained from the continuum limit of the rainbow chain, the analytic expressions are compared with exact numerical results from the lattice, showing an excellent agreement.</p>

Our construction generalizes the AdS/BCFT model by anchoring the end-of-the-world brane on defects at the asymptotic AdS boundary and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions for the metric on the brane. We compute the defect entropy and defect free energy and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-function is always non-negative. We further study holographic defect-localized RG flows triggered by a localized scalar field on the brane and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds. We also verify that our model reproduces the expected forms of correlation functions in DCFTs.</p>

            <p>We provide a systematic construction for local quantum circuits hosting free fermions in disguise, both with staircase and brickwork architectures. Similar to the original Hamiltonian model introduced by Fendley, these circuits are defined by the fact that the Floquet operator corresponding to a single time step can not be diagonalized by means of any Jordan-Wigner transformation, but still displays a free-fermionic spectrum. Our construction makes use of suitable non-local transfer matrices commuting with the Floquet operator, allowing us to establish the free fermionic spectrum. We also study the dynamics of these circuits after they are initialized in arbitrary product states, proving that the evolution of certain local observables can be simulated efficiently on classical computers. Our work proves recent conjectures in the literature and raises new questions on the classical simulability of free fermions in disguise.</p>

            <p>Over the past decades, magnetic frustration has been under intense debate due to its unusual properties. For instance, frustration in the kagome lattice suppresses long range spin correlations and it is expected to be a candidate for a spin liquid system. Therefore, with the advent of experiments with ultra-cold atoms, the interest for frustrated geometries has increased. Given this, in the present work we investigate the repulsive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We examine its thermodynamic properties, as well as the magnetic and transport response of the system at finite temperatures and different values of the repulsive interaction. From these results, we discuss the possible occurrence of adiabatic cooling, a quite important feature in ultra-cold systems, and the presence of a metal-to-insulator transition at a finite interaction strength. Our findings may guide future experiments in ultra-cold fermionic atoms on the kagome lattice.</p>

            <p>We study the mean-field broken symmetry phases of charge neutral multilayer rhombohedral graphene within tight-binding approximations including self-consistent extended Hubbard interactions. We used on-site and inter-site Hubbard interactions obtained from a newly developed first-principles calculation method. Our calculations for systems up to eight layers give rise to electron-hole asymmetries, band flatness, band gaps, and layer anti-ferromagnetic ground states in keeping with available experiments. By including the intersite Hubbard interactions up to the next-nearest neighboring sites, the band gaps are shown to open when the number of layers is larger than three, while the trilayer system maintains its metallic nature with two low energy density of state peaks near the Fermi energy whose separation increases with the range of inter-site Hubbard parameters. Within our framework, the calculated band gaps reflect mean-field ground states with extended Hubbard interactions, in closer agreement with experimental estimates. The tight-binding formulation further enables efficient treatment of large rhombohedral chiral systems, including twisted multilayer graphene.</p>

In this work mixed spin-(1/2,1/2,1) Heisenberg spin trimmer with two different but isotropic Lande $g$-factors and two different exchange constants is considered. The study undertakes the task of finding the optimal parameters to create entangled states and control them by external magnetic field. The primary objective of this work is to examine the tripartite entanglement of a system and the dependence of the tripartite entanglement on various system parameters. Particularly, the effects of non-conserving magnetization are in the focus of our research. The source of non-commutativity between the magnetic moment operator and the Hamiltonian is non-uniformity of $g$-factors. To quantify the tripartite entanglement, an entanglement measure refered to as "tripartite negativity" has been used in this work.</p>

However, the driving force behind these non-equilibrium dynamics is not well-understood. Here, we introduce a topological framework that predicts protected edge flows despite strong thermal motion. Notably, these edge flows produce shear stress that creates global rotation of clusters but not of voids. We verify this theory experimentally using micron-sized super-paramagnetic colloids to demonstrate these emergent physical predictions and show how they drive system re-organization differentially at long timescales. Our results elucidate fundamental principles that shape and control non-equilibrium colloidal aggregates.</p>

            <p>Many systems, classical or quantum, closed or open, exhibit universal statistical properties. Exciton-polariton condensates, being intrinsically driven-dissipative, offer a promising platform for observing non-equilibrium universal features. By conducting extensive numerical simulations of an incoherently pumped and interacting condensate coupled to an exciton reservoir we show that the effective nonlinearity of the condensate phase dynamics can be finely adjusted across a broad range, by varying the exciton-polariton interaction strength, allowing one to probe three main universal regimes with parameters accessible in current experiments: the weakly nonlinear Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime, where the phase fluctuations dominate, but the phase profile does not become rough, the strongly non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang regime, where the condensate phase fluctuations grow in a superdiffusive manner leading to roughening of the phase, and a vortex-dominated phase emerging at stronger interactions, where both density and phase dynamics play significant roles. Our results provide a unified picture of the phase diagram of 2d exciton-polariton condensates under incoherent pumping, and shed light on recent experimental and numerical observations.</p>

            <p>We propose a theoretical model describing a Josephson junction featuring a magnetically textured barrier within two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both $p_x + p_y$ and $p_x + ip_y$ type pairing symmetries. Our study reveals the influence of the magnetic barrier strength and its spatial periodicity on the system's topological properties, in terms of local density of states and Josephson current calculations. Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures.</p>

Furthermore, by matching relevant subspaces, we map the Potts model onto a simpler effective 1D $q$-state Potts model, where $J_2$ acts as the nearest-neighbor interaction and $J_1$ as an effective magnetic field, nontrivially generalizing a 56-year-old theorem previously limited to the simplest case ($q=2$, the Ising model). Our exact results provide insights to phenomena such as atomic or electronic order stacking in layered materials and the emergence of dome-shaped phases in complex phase diagrams.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Błażej Jaworowski, Darrick E. Chang</p>
            <p>Atom arrays with sub-wavelength lattice constant can exhibit fascinating optical properties. For example, the combination of $V$-type level structure and magnetic fields can yield topological band structures, making the neutral atomic excitations behave like charged particles in a magnetic field. Up to now, much of our understanding of these systems (and arrays in general) focuses on the single-excitation regime. Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level to show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states. In particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the harmful divergences near the light cone can be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of magnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling those of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then gives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not only in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only six sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that they can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light contain identifying fingerprints of these states. We believe that these results are a step towards new paradigms of engineering and understanding strongly-correlated many-body states in atom-light interfaces.</p>

            <p>Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.</p>

It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Hall conductivity and orbital diffusion length of Vanadium thin films by Hanle magnetoresistance</h2>

            <p>In spintronics, the spin Hall effect has been widely used to generate and detect spin currents in materials with strong spin-orbit coupling such as Pt and Ta. Recently, its orbital counterpart has drawn attention as a new tool to generate and detect orbital currents and thus investigate orbital transport parameters. In this study, we investigate vanadium (V), a $3d$ transition metal with weak spin-orbit coupling but with a theoretically large orbital Hall conductivity. We measure a large Hanle magnetoresistance in V thin films with a magnitude comparable to that of heavy metals and at least one order of magnitude higher than the spin Hall magnetoresistance observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/V bilayer, pointing to the orbital Hall origin of the effect. A fit of the magnetic-field dependence and thickness dependence of the Hanle magnetoresistance to the standard diffusion model allows us to quantify the orbital diffusion length (~2 nm) and the orbital Hall conductivity (~78 ($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$) of V. The obtained orbital Hall conductivity is two orders of magnitude smaller than theoretical calculations of the intrinsic value, suggesting there is an important role of disorder.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the convergence properties of a collection of iterative electron ptychography methods, under low electron doses ($<$ 10$^3$ $e^-/A^2$) and gives particular attention to the impact of the user-defined update strengths. We demonstrate that carefully chosen values for this parameter, ideally smaller than those conventionally met in the literature, are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice achievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are relatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we demonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error increases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the algorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography, especially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective convergence and correctness of the result.</p>

            <p>Monolayer (1L) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a unique opportunity to control the valley degree of freedom of optically excited charge carriers due to the spin-valley locking effect. Despite extensive studies of the valley-contrasting physics, stimulated by perspective valleytronic applications, a unified picture of competing intervalley coupling processes in 1L-TMDs is lacking. Here, we apply broadband helicity-resolved transient absorption to explore exciton valley polarization dynamics in 1L-WSe${}_2$. By combining experimental results with microscopic simulations, we dissect individual intervalley coupling mechanisms and reveal the crucial role of phonon-assisted scattering in the fast decay of the A exciton circular dichroism and the formation of the dichroism of opposite polarity for the B exciton. We further provide a consistent description of the valley depolarization driven by the combined action of Coulomb scattering processes and indicate the presence of efficient single spin-flip mechanisms. Our study brings us closer to a complete understanding of exciton dynamics in TMDs.</p>

            <p>Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered phase with $0<T<T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schrödinger-invariance and we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from the Schrödinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$ which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.</p>

            <p>We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic study of bound relations between different electronic properties of magnetic crystals: electron density, effective mass, orbital magnetization, localization length, Chern invariant, and electric susceptibility. All relations are satisfied for a group of low-lying bands, while some remain valid for upper bands. New results include a lower bound on the electric susceptibility of Chern insulators, and an upper bound on the sum-rule part of the orbital magnetization. In addition, bounds involving the Chern invariant are generalized from two dimensions (Chern number) to three (Chern vector). Bound relations are established for metals as well as insulators, and are illustrated for model systems. The manner in which they approach saturation in a model Chern insulator with tunable flat bands is analyzed in terms of the optical absorption spectrum.</p>

            <p>Nonreciprocal interactions are widely observed in nonequilibrium systems, from biological or sociological dynamics to open quantum systems. Despite the ubiquity of nonreciprocity, its impact on phase transitions is not fully understood. In this work, we derive criteria to perturbatively assess whether nonreciprocity changes the universality class of pairs of asymmetrically coupled systems undergoing a phase transition. These simple criteria are stated in terms of the unperturbed critical exponents, in the spirit of the Harris criterion for disordered systems, and agree with numerical simulations. Beyond nonreciprocity, our approach provides guidelines for assessing how dynamical phase transitions are affected by perturbations.</p>

            <p>Methods of elucidating the mechanisms of fast-ion conduction in solid-state materials are pivotal for advancements in energy technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and supercapacitors. In this study, we examine the ionic conduction pathways in single crystal SrCl$_2$, which is a fast-ion conductor above 900~K, using four-dimensional Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (4D-QENS). We explore both coherent and incoherent neutron scattering at temperatures above the transition temperature into the superionic phase to explore the correlated motion of hopping anions. Refinements of the incoherent QENS yield residence times and jump probabilities between lattice sites in good agreement with previous studies, confirming that ionic hopping along nearest-neighbor directions is the most probable conduction pathway. However, the coherent QENS reveals evidence of de Gennes narrowing, indicating the importance of ionic correlations in the conduction mechanism. This highlights the need for improvements both in the theory of ionic transport in fluorite compounds and the modeling of coherent 4D-QENS in single crystals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Wong</p>
            <p>Quantum teleportation can be used to define a notion of parallel transport which characterizes the entanglement structure of a quantum state \cite{Czech:2018kvg}. This suggests one can formulate a gauge theory of entanglement. In \cite{Wong:2022mnv}, it was explained that measurement based quantum computation in one dimension can be understood in term of such a gauge theory (MBQC). In this work, we give an alternative formulation of this "entanglement gauge theory" as an extended topological field theory. This formulation gives a alternative perspective on the relation between the circuit model and MBQC. In addition, it provides an interpretation of MBQC in terms of the extended Hilbert space construction in gauge theories, in which the entanglement edge modes play the role of the logical qubit.</p>

            <p>Simulating noninteracting fermion systems is a common task in computational many-body physics. In absence of translational symmetries, modeling free fermions on $N$ modes usually requires poly$(N)$ computational resources. While often moderate, these costs can be prohibitive in practice when large systems are considered. We present several free-fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with substantially reduced computational costs. The memory costs are exponentially improved, poly log$(N)$. The runtime improvement, compared to the best known classical algorithms, is either exponential or significantly polynomial, depending on the geometry of the problem. The simulation of free-fermion dynamics belongs to the BQP-hard complexity class. This implies (under standard assumptions) that our algorithm yields an exponential speedup for any classical algorithm at least for some geometries. The key technique in our algorithm is the block-encoding of objects such as correlation matrices and Green's functions into a unitary. We demonstrate how such unitaries can be efficiently realized as quantum circuits, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians. The special cases of disordered and inhomogeneous lattices, as well as large non-lattice graphs, are presented in detail. Finally, we show that our simulation algorithm generalizes to other promising targets, including free boson systems.</p>

Coarse-graining allows access to constraints from significantly larger subsystems than previously possible, yielding substantially tighter bounds compared to earlier methods.</p>

            <p>We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Bringing two semi-infinite heat baths at different temperatures into thermal contact along a surface, the NESS arises at asymptotically late times as a stationary state that has modewise thermal properties and features a heat flow between the reservoirs. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the transition rate with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not couple to the heat flow, causing the detector to only register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</p>

            <h2>Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naruo Ohga, Takuya Hatomura</p>
            <p>Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems, and it effectively incorporates nonlocal information. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.</p>

            <p>We investigate the emergence of quantum complexity and chaos in doped Clifford circuits acting on qudits of odd prime dimension $d$. Using doped Clifford Weingarten calculus and a replica tensor network formalism, we derive exact results and perform large-scale simulations in regimes challenging for tensor network and Pauli-based methods. We begin by analyzing generalized stabilizer entropies, computable magic monotones in many-qudit systems, and identify a dynamical phase transition in the doping rate, marking the breakdown of classical simulability and the onset of Haar-random behavior. The critical behavior is governed by the qudit dimension and the magic content of the non-Clifford gate. Using the qudit $T$-gate as a benchmark, we show that higher-dimensional qudits converge faster to Haar-typical stabilizer entropies. For qutrits ($d=3$), analytical predictions match numerics on brickwork circuits, showing that locality plays a limited role in magic spreading. We also examine anticoncentration and entanglement growth, showing that $O(\log N)$ non-Clifford gates suffice for approximating Haar expectation values to precision $\varepsilon$, and relate antiflatness measures to stabilizer entropies in qutrit systems. Finally, we analyze out-of-time-order correlators and show that a finite density of non-Clifford gates is needed to induce chaos, with a sharp transition fixed by the local dimension, twice that of the magic transition. Altogether, these results establish a unified framework for diagnosing complexity in doped Clifford circuits and deepen our understanding of resource theories in multiqudit systems.</p>

            <h2>Average-computation benchmarking for local expectation values in digital quantum devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Baccari, Pavel Kos, Georgios Styliaris</p>
            <p>As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a limited number of different circuit realizations.</p>

            <p>Crystalline structure prediction is an essential prerequisite for designing materials with targeted properties. Yet, it is still an open challenge in materials design and drug discovery. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting three-dimensional non-polymeric crystal structures remains elusive. In this work, we focus on the molecular assembly problem, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Such a simplified formulation provides a useful approximation to the actual problem. However, while recent state-of-the-art methods have increasingly adopted sophisticated techniques, the underlying learning objective remains ill-posed. We propose a better formulation that introduces a loss function capturing key geometric molecular properties while ensuring permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. Remarkably, we demonstrate that within this framework, a simple regression model already outperforms prior approaches, including flow matching techniques, on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated non-polymeric subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations of the classical and quantum crossover are consistent with each other, reflecting quantum-classical correspondence despite the noncommutativity of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement, quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems.</p>

Importantly, this single-photon-seeded regime is modeled as an initial weak excitation of the condensate mode. We quantify the memory performance by a classical polarization-alignment metric and find that the seed polarization can remain well preserved on a nanosecond timescale under realistic parameters.</p>

In particular, intrinsic noise components that are independent of the relaxation time reveal universal band-geometric properties of Bloch electrons. Here, we identify a distinct intrinsic contribution to current noise at second order in the electric field, which is governed by the quantum metric. This effect arises from field-induced modifications to Bloch wavefunctions and band energies, and it dominates in PT-symmetric antiferromagnets where Berry curvature based contributions are forbidden by symmetry. Applying our theory to CuMnAs, we demonstrate that thermal noise provides a direct signature of quantum metric in PT-symmetric antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>A spin supersolid is characterized by the simultaneous breaking of lattice translation and continuous spin rotation symmetries. In this work, we study a spin-1 model with $U(2)\cong SU(2)\times U(1)/Z_2$ symmetry on the triangular lattice, and the phase diagram is figured out using a variational $\mathbb CP^2$ approach. We identify a novel $SU(2)$-supersolid phase which contains a 3-sublattice solid order and a spin-superfluid order. Unlike usual supersolid phases having noncollinear magnetic order and only one Goldstone mode, the $SU(2)$-supersolid phase has collinear Neel order and two Goldstone modes. Another important feature of this supersolid is that the magnon excitation spectrum has symmetry protected double degeneracy in the whole Brillouin zone. As by-products, several other ordered phases are obtained, including the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic states breaking the $SU(2)$ symmetry, as well as genuine phases that completely breaks the $U(2)$ symmetry. Furthermore, the instabilities of $SU(3)$-flavor linear spin-wave theory are consistent with the phase boundaries between different ordered phases. %dispersions confirm the stability of the classically ordered phases and provides insights into their excitation spectra.</p>

We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of a six-qubit device vary by up to $\pm 100$ MHz while performing a variety of experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept constant to within 15 $\mathrm{\mu}$V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than $\pm 7$ MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise spectral density shows roughly a $1/f$ trend above $10^{-4}$ Hz and, strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.</p>

            <h2>Luttinger surface and exchange splitting induced by ferromagnetic fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Motoharu Kitatani, Yusuke Nomura, Shiro Sakai, Ryotaro Arita</p>
            <p>Ferromagnetism in the single-orbital Hubbard model, which contains only local Coulomb repulsion and no explicit ferromagnetic exchange interactions, has been extensively studied. However, how the associated fluctuations influence the electronic properties near the transition remains a fundamental issue. Here, by applying the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) to single-orbital systems with a partially flat band dispersion, we demonstrate that finite-correlation-length ferromagnetic fluctuations generate an emergent Luttinger surface and drive a Fermi surface expansion reminiscent of exchange splitting, even without magnetic order. We further derive an analytical expression that reproduces these effects, clarifying the microscopic origin for fluctuation-driven exchange splitting in correlated electron systems.</p>

            <h2>Spin band geometry drives intrinsic thermal spin magnetization and current</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sankar Sarkar, Harsh Varshney, Sayan Sarkar, Amit Agarwal</p>
            <p>Generating spin magnetization and spin currents without magnetic or electric fields is a key frontier in spin caloritronics. Spin responses driven by thermal gradients offer a promising route, though the band geometric origin of intrinsic mechanisms, especially in non-magnetic materials, remains poorly understood. Here we develop a unified quantum theory of thermal spin magnetization and spin currents in itinerant electrons, rooted in spin band geometry with both Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea contributions. We identify two key geometric quantities: the spin-velocity metric tensor, which governs thermal spin magnetization, and the spin geometric tensor, combining spin Berry curvature and spin quantum metric, which generates thermal spin currents. These intrinsic contributions persist and can even dominate in non-magnetic insulators. Numerical calculations for chiral metal RhGe and antiferromagnet CuMnAs demonstrate sizable thermal spin responses near band crossings. Our results establish the band geometric origin of thermal spin transport and provide guiding principles for discovering and engineering next-generation spin caloritronic materials.</p>

            <p>The study of topological properties in magnetic materials has long been one of the forefront research areas in condensed matter physics. CrSb, as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism, has attracted significant attention due to its unique magnetic properties. This system provides a novel platform for exploring the intrinsic relationship between altermagnetic order and exotic topological states. In this study, we combine systematic electrical transport experiments with first-principles calculations to investigate the possible realization mechanisms of topological semimetal states in CrSb and their manifestations in quantum transport phenomena. Our high field magneto-transport measurements reveal that the magnetoresistance of CrSb exhibits no sign of saturation up to 35 T, following a distinct power-law dependence with an exponent of 1.48. The nonlinear Hall resistivity further indicates a multiband charge transport mechanism. Under high magnetic fields, we observe pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations and discernible Zeeman-effect-induced band splitting at 1.6 K. Systematic Fermi surface and band calculations combined with Berry phase analysis confirm the nontrivial topological character of this material (with a Berry phase approaching {\pi}). These findings not only provide crucial experimental evidence for understanding the electronic structure of CrSb, but also establish an important foundation for investigating topological quantum states in altermagnets.</p>

            <p>The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shi Yin, Zujian Dai, Xinyang Pan, Lixin He</p>
            <p>Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Attis V. M. Marino, M. A. Caracanhas, V. S. Bagnato, B. Chakrabarti</p>
            <p>We present numerically exact non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas in quasi-periodic lattice that plays an intermediate role between the long-ranged order and truly disordered systems exhibiting unusual correlated phases. Precision control over lattice depth, interaction strength and filling factor enables the exploration of various correlated phases in a finite periodic lattice. We investigate the system dynamics when the secondary incommensurate lattice is abruptly switched on. To solve the many-body Schroedinger equation, we employ the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). The many-body dynamics are analyzed through distinct measures of the Glauber correlation functions and dynamical fragmentation. Our study reveals four distinct scenarios of localization process in the non-equilibrium dynamics. Weakly interacting non-fragmented superfluid of incommensurate filling in the primary lattice exhibits collapse-revival dynamics of localization. In contrast, a fragmented superfluid with commensurate filling exhibits dynamical Mott localization. A strongly correlated, fully fragmented Mott state shows a subtle competition with localization introduced by the secondary lattice that merely melts the Mott correlations. Interestingly, in the fermionized Mott regime, where the density in each well is fragmented, the intra-dimer correlations exhibit unexpected robustness. These findings provide new insights into many-body correlation dynamics and novel localization mechanisms in quasi-periodic lattices, paving the way for engineering exotic quantum behaviors in ultracold atomic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hareram Swain, Arijit Mandal, S. Satpathy, B.R.K. Nanda</p>
            <p>Scattering of electrons from chiral spin textures such as the skyrmions is an emerging research area due to its richness in topological quantum transport, which is significant for spintronic devices. We study the dynamical process of scattering of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian wavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular dependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the spin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial outcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities irrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts associated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound state at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics, the numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary spin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin transport.</p>

            <p>The spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), one of the hallmarks of unconventional superconductivity, has been observed in the superconducting state of Sr2RuO4 by muon spin rotation in several independent studies. However, the chiral edge current expected in such a superconductor has not yet been established experimentally. In addition, the angle dependence of the phase of the superconducting order parameter (OP) in Sr2RuO4, which would enable determination of the full symmetry properties of the OP, has been determined only for a couple of angles. Both issues can be addressed by preparing high-quality Josephson junctions between Sr2RuO4 and a conventional s-wave superconductor with varying orientations relative to the crystal axes. Here we report the successful fabrication of ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/ Sr2RuO4 on thin single crystals of Sr2RuO4 obtained by mechanical exfoliation. These junctions exhibit high-quality quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field. Moreover, the junction resistance was found to be extremely sensitive to the current flowing in the Sr2RuO4 crystal, a feature that was used in this work to show that the chiral edge current. The approach to the chiral edge current detection, which was not used previously, was verified by a control experiment.</p>

            <p>Spin qubits need to operate within a very precise voltage space around charge state transitions to achieve high-fidelity gates. However, the stability diagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to acquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state increases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability diagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor. Currently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach shows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in the number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an autotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by harnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET), the measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8. This led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of a SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the Python code execution.</p>

            <h2>Quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors revealed by optical conductivity measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hwiwoo Park, Sung-Sik Lee, G. D. Gu, Jungseek Hwang</p>
            <p>The ubiquitous temperature ($T$)-linear behaviour of the transport scattering rate in the normal state of strongly correlated electron systems is called strange metallicity \cite{zaanen:2004,phillips:2022,hartnoll:2022,chowdhury:2022,yuan:2022}. Although strange metallicity is crucial to understanding superconductivity in correlated electron systems, its origin remains elusive to date \cite{hussey:2023}. Here, we present the doping-, temperature-, and frequency ($\omega$)-dependent transport properties of overdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ in a wide doping range of 0.183 to 0.231. We observe that the optical scattering rate and effective mass exhibit an $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour at a critical doping of $p_{c} \simeq$ 0.231. Away from the critical doping, the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour is destroyed below a doping-dependent crossover temperature $T_\Delta(p) \sim |p-p_{c}|^{0.24}$. Furthermore, the optical coherence mode (OCM) observed within the superconducting dome rapidly broadens and eventually disappears as the critical doping is approached. The emergence of the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour of the transport scattering rate and broadening of the OCM near the critical doping strongly suggests that strange metallic behaviour is caused by quantum critical fluctuations. Our results provide compelling spectroscopic evidence for quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors.</p>

            <p>We investigated hole (Cd)- and electron (Sn)-doped CeCoIn$_5$ (CeCo(In$_{1-x}T_x$)$_5$ ($T$ = Cd or Sn)) using infrared spectroscopy. Doping-dependent hybridization gap distribution functions were obtained from the optical conductivity spectra based on the periodic Anderson model formalism. The hybridization gap distribution exhibits two components: in-plane and out-of-plane hybridization gaps. The doping-dependent evolution of the two gaps indicated that the out-of-plane gap was more sensitive to doping. Furthermore, the magnetic optical resistivity exhibited a doping-dependent evolution of the $f$-electron amplitude. The two dopant types exhibited different physical properties depending on the level of doping. The Sn dopant increases the $f$-electron amplitude, whereas the Cd dopant does not affect the $f$-electron amplitude. Doping-dependent effective mass is peaked at pure (or undoped) CeCoIn$_5$. Our spectroscopic results may help understand the doping-dependent electronic evolution of one of the canonical heavy fermion systems, CeCoIn$_5$.</p>

In the weak coupling regime, we only observe fundamental magnetoelastic wave signal at $f_{1}$. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime, in addition to the fundamental magnetoelastic wave, we observe subharmonic and harmonic signals at $3/2f_{1}$, $2f_{1}$, and $3f_{1}$, which are well reproduced by our analytical model. Our results establish phonons as a means to generate and control nonlinear magnons in the strong coupling regime, providing a new route for magnonic signal processing.</p>

            <p>Magnonic waveguide based on domain wall (DW) is considered as a crucial breakthrough toward the realization of magnonic nanocircuits. However, the effective control of spin waves propagating in DWs remains to be explored. Here, we construct a magnonic crystal (MC) by using a chain of the domain wall skyrmions (DWSKs) to manipulate the spin-wave propagation in DWs. We show that the DWSK chain can be created by leveraging voltage-controlled Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The DWSK-based MC opens magnonic bandgaps, which can be dynamically adjusted through magnetic fields modulating the DWSK size. Furthermore, the manipulation of spin waves by the DWSK-based MC maintains robust in curved DW, demonstrating its adaptability to complex device architectures. Our work provides an effective method to control the spin-wave propagation in DWs and paves the way for designing energy-efficient magnonic nanocircuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Lu, Yuanfan Yang, Zhongqing Guo, Jianpeng Liu</p>
            <p>Moiré superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states, including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moiré systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to moiré superlattice consisted of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Our all-band Hartree-Fock calculations, which include all plane-wave components up to the high-energy cutoff of the continuum model, reveal a phase diagram at moiré filling $\nu=1$ that qualitatively aligns with experimental measurements. Incorporating RPA correlation energy further yields quantitative agreement with the evolution of transport properties across electric fields. The $GW$ quasiparticle bands exhibit significantly reduced gaps and bandwidths compared to Hartree-Fock results, while quasiparticle weights close to unity indicate that the ground state is well-described by a Slater determinant, justifying the qualitative effectiveness of mean-field approaches for integer fillings in this system. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moiré systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jakkapat Seeyangnok, Udomsilp Pinsook</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive first-principles study of hydrogenated M2X (M = Mo, V, Zr; X = C, N) MXene monolayers, focusing on their structural stability, electronic properties, and superconducting behavior. Structural optimizations combined with phonon spectra reveal that partial hydrogenation (1H and 2H) is dynamically stable across most compositions, while full hydrogenation (4H) generally induces lattice instabilities. A notable exception is Zr2CH4, which retains dynamical stability even under maximum hydrogen coverage. Electronic structure analysis shows that all hydrogenated MXenes remain metallic, with the Fermi level dominated by transition-metal d orbitals. In Zr2CH4, a Dirac-like band crossing at the Fermi level is observed, which is gapped by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), yielding a finite gap of 0.095 eV. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations demonstrate that Mo-based MXenes exhibit strong EPC, with coupling constants lambda = 0.95 (Mo2CH), 1.23 (Mo2NH), and 1.55 (Mo2NH2), corresponding to superconducting critical temperatures Tc about 15 to 22 K within the Allen-Dynes framework (mu* = 0.10). By contrast, V- and Zr-based MXenes display weak EPC and negligible Tc, with Zr2CH4 being a special case hosting Dirac-like states rather than superconductivity. Our findings highlight hydrogen functionalization as an effective strategy to stabilize MXene monolayers and to tune their low-energy physics, revealing Mo-based nitride MXenes as promising phonon-mediated superconductors, while Zr2CH4 emerges as a candidate for Dirac physics.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen and lithium functionalization of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a promising route to enhance electronic properties and induce superconductivity. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to explore the phase stability and superconducting behavior of hydrogenated and lithiated Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) monolayers. Among Ga2SH, Ga2SLi, GaInSH, and GaInSLi, only the 2H-GaInSLi structure is dynamically, thermally, and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon dispersion, ab initio molecular dynamics, and elastic constants. This monolayer adopts a hexagonal lattice, exhibits metallic behavior, and has a negative formation energy, suggesting experimental feasibility. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals phonon-mediated superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.8 K. Notably, three distinct superconducting gaps emerge, linked to specific atomic orbitals and phonon modes. Electron doping of 0.2 e per cell increases Tc to nearly 6.2 K while maintaining the three-gap character. These results highlight the effectiveness of selective functionalization in engineering superconductivity and identify GaInSLi as a promising platform for next-generation multi-gap 2D superconducting devices.</p>

In this review, we explore each facet of the altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements.

The swelling properties and microstructure of the resulting copolymer microgels with N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM, LCST ca. 32°C) and N-isopropylmethacrylamide (NIPMAM, LCST ca. 44°C) are then characterized via turbidimetry, DLS, and AFM. At low comonomer contents, all microgel particles exhibit moderate growth in size. Beyond a system-specific threshold, we observe a significant jump in size, and smoother swelling behavior. For NIPAM-HIPAM, the size increase is linked to a strong rise in swelling capacity, and the formation of a thick corona. The effect of the hydrophilic comonomers on the VPTT correlates linearly with their true composition, allowing us to extrapolate the VPTT of hypothetical pure HMAM and HIPAM microgels. This leads to 99°C for HMAM, and 68°C for HIPAM for the respective VPTT. These numbers can be seen as useful indicators of the effect of these monomers on the VPTT in the copolymerized microgels. The observed changes in VPTT, swelling, size, and morphology suggest that high-VPTT microgels possess unique internal molecular composition gradients, likely due to hydrophobic interactions during synthesis. Our results have potential implications for developing temperature-sensitive microgel-based membranes that can self-adapt their permeability at higher operating temperatures in energy applications.</p>

            <h2>Type-II Band Alignment in the $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/Rutile GeO$_2$ Heterojunction toward Solar-Blind Photodetection: A first-principles study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Q. Fang</p>
            <p>Semiconductor heterostructures capable of separating photogenerated electrons and holes have a wide range of optoelectronic applications, including photodetectors, solar cells, and photocatalysts. ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and rutile GeO$_2$ are both ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors, with bandgaps of 4.85 eV and 4.68 eV, respectively. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to investigate the band alignment of the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ heterojunction and explore the effect of interfacial oxygen vacancy. Calculations using the PBE0 hybrid functional based on an interface model show that a type-II band alignment emerges at the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ interface, which facilitates the separation of photogenerated carriers. The valence band maximum of ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ lies 0.38 eV below that of rutile GeO$_2$, and its conduction band minimum lies 0.36 eV below. The presence of interfacial oxygen vacancy in the stable configuration leads to a reduction in the band offset. Our results suggest that the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ heterojunction holds significant promise for application in strictly solar-blind photodetectors.</p>

The simulation accurately predicts the experimental absorption spectrum of the structure within only a few meV, an almost ten-fold improvement over simulations using a square-band profile with nominal alloy compositions, and a significant step forward in accurate and predictive simulations of the optical properties epitaxial heterostructures for emission, modulation and detection in mid-infrared.</p>

            <p>The characterization of nanostructued materials under reactive environments is challenging due to the complexity of the structural motifs involved and their chemical transformations. Global optimization approaches allow predicting stable structures for targeted materials but addressing the configurational and compositional search spaces is both computationally demanding and inefficient, especially when first principles calculations are required. In this work, we implement and evaluate a computationally efficient grand canonical global optimization algorithm able to identify stable structures and chemical states of targeted systems under given reaction conditions (e.g. reactant pressure and temperature). The algorithm leverages an on-the-fly trained machine-learning interatomic potential based on sparse Gaussian Process Regression and the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to reduce the number of first principles energy evaluations carried out during global optimization searches. The \textit{ab initio} thermodynamics framework is incorporated to approximate the Gibbs energy of evaluated candidates, performing environment-aware optimizations over multiple stoichiometries. We demonstrate the computational performance of this approach and its ability to reproduce some literature examples.</p>

            <p>Few-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ has been studied under pressure using Raman spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell up to 60 GPa (at room temperature). A combination of AFM and Raman was used to estimate the thickness of the specimens. While few-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ shows identical structural evolution with the one of the bulk powder-like form of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ ( $\alpha$ $\rightarrow$ $\beta^{'}$ $\rightarrow$ IV ), an abrupt $\beta^{'}$ $\rightarrow$ IV phase transition (at 45 GPa) was observed, in contrast with the case of the bulk specimen where the two phases coexist over a wide pressure range. This is attributed to the difference in specimens morphology, $i.e.$ single crystal and powder in the case of few-layer and bulk $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$, respectively. This study documents the significance of specimens morphology on the observed pressure-induced phase transitions. The methodology developed in this study for performing high-pressure Raman measurements can be applied to other nanodimensional layered materials.</p>

            <p>Active particle systems are a class of non-equilibrium systems composed of self-propelled Brownian particles; through interactions between particles within the system, a variety of intriguing collective behaviors can emerge. Based on Brownian dynamics simulations, this study investigates the formation and transition mechanisms of ordered structures in active particle systems regulated by light fields. The study reveals that, under light field regulation, active particles undergo large-scale phase separation behavior, forming specific ordered structures and enabling the dynamic transition between multiple ordered structures. This study systematically explores the effects of light fields on this dynamic phase transition and the corresponding regulatory mechanisms. The research findings provide important references for the precise regulation of collective structures in active systems and the fabrication of micro-nano intelligent devices.</p>

            <p>Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of symmetry constraint in Floquet topological superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming-Jian Gao, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>Topological superconductor is regarded as an ideal candidate for topological quantum computing due to its ability to simulate the enigmatic Majorana fermions that satisfy non-Abelian statistics. Previous studies revealed that symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders of Majorana modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of Majorana modes. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this symmetry-imposed constraint on topological phases. By applying periodic driving on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order Majorana modes are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological superconductors with coexisting first-order Majorana boundary modes and second-order Majorana corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single gap are generated at ease by the periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an avenue for the creation of exotic topological superconductors without altering symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host topological superconductor.</p>

Our results emphasize the essential role of higher-order magnetic multipoles and the intrinsic structure-spin correlations in these systems, thereby advancing current efforts to control spin splitting in real materials and motivating future experimental studies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuxuan Guo, Sheng Yang, Xue-Jia Yu</p>
            <p>Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems.</p>

            <p>Neuromorphic computing circuits can be realized using memristors based on low-dimensional materials enabling enhanced metal diffusion for resistive switching. Here, we investigate memristive properties of vertically aligned MoS$_2$ (VA-MoS$_2$) films with three different metal electrodes: Ag, Cu, and Au. Despite having the same active material, all three metals show distinct switching behavior, which are crucial for neuromorphic computing applications: Ag enables volatile switching, Cu demonstrates stable non-volatile switching with retention over 2500 s, and Au shows no memristive response. Cu devices show abrupt resistance changes, and significant increase of copper content upon biasing, indicative of stable non-volatile switching based on filament formation and rupture. About 85% of Ag and Cu devices exhibit reliable memristor behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into the memristive switching mechanism in VA-MoS$_2$ and present a promising avenue for facile fabrication of neuromorphic circuits by employing a set of different metals on a single active material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rahul Nayak, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Satyavani Vemparala</p>
            <p>Soft glassy materials often consist of deformable objects. Here, we use a two-dimensional assembly of semi-flexible ring polymers as a model system to investigate how polydispersity in particle stiffness or size influences the onset of glassy dynamics. In simulations at fixed polydispersity 30%, we find that stiffness dispersity drives most rings into elongated conformations at high densities, leading to orientationally ordered structures that cause dynamical slowing down. In contrast, size dispersity generates a bimodal population: small rings remain circular and act as rigid inclusions, while large rings elongate, producing frustration that delays arrest. Real-space maps of bond relaxation reveal strikingly different pathways of dynamical heterogeneity, with long-lived domains persisting under stiffness dispersity but rapidly percolating relaxation under size dispersity. Moreover, local correlations between ring shape, orientational order, and mobility show that stiffness dispersity produces dynamics that are strongly structure-sensitive, whereas size dispersity activates motion from both circular and elongated populations. By linking microscopic deformability to emergent glassy dynamics, this study identifies how the nature of polydispersity controls the relaxation pathways of soft glasses.</p>

            <p>Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder - an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales. We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.</p>

            <p>Lead halide perovskites have catalyzed the rise of main-group metal halide materials as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors, and photocatalysts. Among these, effi-cient light-emission arises from self-trapped excitons, wherein excited states induce transient lattice distortions that localize excitons. However, the complex interplay of factors, such as lattice distortions, lattice softness, and electron-phonon cou-pling dynamics, obscures the direct structure-property relationships complicating the targeted material design. In this study, we advance the understanding of self-trapped exciton (STE)-based emission in hybrid antimony and bismuth halides, em-phasizing the interplay of structural and electronic factors that enhance white-light emission. We systematically vary com-position, anion dimensionality, connectivity, and the organic cation and find that the presence of Bi/Sb and Cl in edge-sharing anion motifs promotes white-light emission and optimal electron-phonon coupling. Chlorides outperform bromides, and organic cations, such as CMA and BZA, only subtly influence optical behavior by altering lattice dynamics and rigidity, resulting in tunable emission characteristics without compromising STEs. This work deepens the understanding of the emis-sion mechanisms in hybrid halide perovskites and establishes guiding principles for tailoring optoelectronic properties, paving the way for advanced materials with enhanced white-light emission for next-generation optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative description of the surface tension minimum in a two-component surfactant system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Edgar M. Blokhuis</p>
            <p>The Gibbs adsorption equation is the thermodynamic cornerstone for the description and understanding of the surface tension in a surfactant solution. It relates the decrease in surface tension to an increased surfactant adsorption. In the early 1940's, it therefore puzzled researchers to sometimes observe a minimum in the surface tension for certain surfactant solutions, which seemed to indicate surfactant desorption (even depletion) according to the Gibbs adsorption equation. It is now understood that the minimum is related to contamination of the surfactant (notably by dodecanol) and its occurrence has since then been studied extensively in experiments. Still, the precise role of the (tiny amount of) contaminant present is not well understood and a quantitative description and understanding of the minimum in the experimental surface tension is lacking. It is the aim of the present article to provide such a quantitative description. Our theoretical analysis is based on a Statistical Thermodynamic treatment of the Langmuir model for a surfactant mixture combined with the mass action model adapted to describe the formation of mixed micelles. A new Statistical Thermodynamic expression for the surface tension is derived and used to compare with a number of surface tension experiments for both ionic and non-ionic surfactant systems.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, a class of unconventional antiferromagnets where antiparallel spins are connected by combined rotational and translational symmetries, have recently emerged as promising candidates for spintronic applications, as they can efficiently generate spin currents while maintaining vanishing net magnetization. Here, we investigate charge transport and spin currents in $\alpha$-MnTe, a prototypical altermagnet, using symmetry analysis within the multipole framework and fully relativistic first-principles calculations using the Kubo formalism. Our results show that different magnetic configurations with Néel vectors $\hat{N}\parallel y$ and $\hat{N}\parallel x$ in MnTe induce distinct order parameters. This distinction gives rise to spin-momentum locking with different parities and magnetic spin Hall effects (magnetic SHEs) with different anisotropies. Strikingly, our calculations show that the combination of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and altermagnetic spin splitting yields a large magnetic spin Hall angle of up to 16 \% rivaling or exceeding that of heavy metals such as Pt. On the other hand, the anisotropy of the magnetic SHE provides a practical means to identify the type of order parameter. This establishes, through the powerful framework of multipoles, a general approach for studying transport phenomena that extends to a broader class of altermagnets beyond MnTe.</p>

            <p>Recent studies of the self-assembly of Langmuir monolayers have revealed novel forms of lateral molecular ordering. Such studies typically involve the use of grazing-incidence synchrotron radiation scattering, and the lateral order manifests itself as distinct diffraction patterns. The more intricate the molecular organization, the more complicated the corresponding diffraction pattern is. To the point where standard analysis, i.e., identifying peak positions and solving the crystal structure, is insufficient to describe the system. In such cases, a physics-based simulation of the diffraction is required. In this article, we present a versatile theoretical framework for simulating complex structural molecular ordering in Langmuir monolayers. We begin by applying the formalism to a simple case of solid-state monolayers and extend the analysis to describe the structural organization in the collapsed state. The applicability of the method is validated through comparison with experimental data collected at the bending magnet synchrotron beamline.</p>

            <p>A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.</p>

            <p>Kagome materials with charge density waves (CDWs) are fascinating quantum systems, offering an ideal platform to explore intertwined orders and to uncover novel mechanisms behind CDW formation. Chemical models have been developed and applied to predict CDW in $AM_6X_6$-type kagome materials, such as the rattling chain model based on ScV6Sn6 and the magnetic energy-saving model based on FeGe. In this study, we successfully synthesized Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 single crystals using the vapor transport method. As predicted by the rattling chain model, these crystals are expected to exhibit kagome CDW behavior. Magnetization measurements indicate that Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 is an easy-axis antiferromagnet with T_N = 488 K and transport measurements reveal metallic behavior primarily driven by electron-type carriers. However, no clear signatures of a CDW were observed in Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate a markedly distinct electronic structure compared to related compounds: instead of a carrier-doping-induced rigid shift, the density of states shifted away from the Fermi level. Consistent with our structural investigations, the absence of a CDW and the unusual band structure can be attributed to the bonding characteristic within Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. The strong covalent bonds of Ti-Ge1b, along with the solid Ge1b-Ge1b dimers, prevent the Ti-Ge1b-Ge1b-Ti chain from rattling. The presence of Fe-Fe antibonding state at the Fermi level enhances the spin polarization and depletes the electronic density around the Fermi level. Our results suggest that both the ionic radius and the bonding characteristics of the filler atom are crucial for the formation of CDWs in kagome materials. These factors can serve as supplementary terms to the rattling chain model, providing new insights for the discovery of novel kagome CDW materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taoufik Sakhraoui, František Karlický</p>
            <p>Using the density functional tight binding method (DFTB) and the GFN1-xTB (Geometries, Frequencies, and Noncovalent interactions Tight Binding) Hamiltonian, we have investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of vacancy defects, hydrogen and oxygen passivated defects, and Fe adsorption in two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (gt-C$_3$N$_4$) 2D material. The ring shape is the most preferred vacancy evolution path, with significant stability of the semicircle fourfold C-N-C-N vacancy. We found that bare gt-C$_3$N$_4$ which is non-magnetic becomes magnetic by 2-, and 5-defects creation, hydrogen/oxygen passivation of the defects, and upon Fe adsorption. Interestingly, Fe atoms interact with the gt-C$_3$N$_4$ sheet and result in a ground ferromagnetic (FM) state. In addition, we investigate the effects of passivating the vacancies by hydrogen in gt-C$_3$N$_4$ on its structural, electrical, and magnetic properties. We found that substituting the 1, 2, and 3 vacancies with hydrogen and passivating the 6-defect with oxygen turns on magnetism in the system. Due to structural distortion, the passivated defects do not have a well-ordered magnetic orientation. However, passivating the remaining defected structures maintains the nonmagnetic state. It is also shown that passivation leads to a semiconductor with a band gap value higher than that of the bare material. We also calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal (TM) atoms, including V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni-adsorbed gt-C$_3$N$_4$ monolayer. All TM atoms show slight lattice distortion, and the adsorbed system almost maintains the original structure type. Moreover, a FM alignment was observed with a total magnetic moments of 2.89 $\mu_B$, 2 $\mu_B$, and 1 $\mu_B$ for V, Fe, and Co atoms, respectively. The Cr, Mn, and Ni atoms induce no magnetism to the non magnetic gt-C$_3$N$_4$ system.</p>

            <p>The quantum Hall effect hosts quantum phase transitions in which the localization length, that is the size of disorder-induced bulk localized states, is governed by universal scaling from percolation theory. However, this universal character is not systematically observed in experiments, including very recent ones in extremely clean devices. Here we explore this non-universality by systematically measuring the localization length in broken-symmetry quantum Hall states of graphene. Depending on the nature and gap size of these states, we observe differences of up to a tenfold in the minimum localization length, accompanied by clear deviations from universal scaling. Our results, as well as the previously observed non-universality, are fully captured by a simple picture based on the co-existence of localized states from two successive sub-Landau levels.</p>

            <h2>Massive Discovery of Low-Dimensional Materials from Universal Computational Strategy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Bagheri, Ethan Berger, Hannu-Pekka Komsa, Pekka Koskinen</p>
            <p>Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials. Here, we combined universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs) and an advanced, interatomic force constant (FC) -based dimensionality classification method to make a massive discovery of novel low-dimensional materials. We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized. By calculating the binding energies for the discovered 2D materials, we also identified 960 sheets that could be easily or potentially exfoliated from their parent bulk structures.</p>

            <h2>A follow-up on the sulphur atom popping model for MoS$_2$ memristor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchali Mitra, Santanu Mahapatra</p>
            <p>The mechanism of resistive switching in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor-based memristors is intriguing, and our conventional knowledge of bulk-oxide based memristors does not apply to these devices. Experimental data indicate that the genesis of resistive switching may be intrinsic to the 2D semiconducting active layer, as well as resulting from the movement of electrode atoms. Employing reactive-force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we introduced the "sulphur atom popping model" [npj 2D Mater. Appl. 5, 33 (2021)] to elucidate the intrinsic nature of non-volatile resistive switching in 2D molybdenum disulfide-based memristors. In this paper we provide additional perspective to this model using density functional theory. We also discuss the limitations of universal machine learning interatomic potentials in reproducing ReaxFF simulation results.</p>

            <h2>Solution of the Anderson chain with two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Igor N. Karnaukhov</p>
            <p>A modified Anderson lattice is proposed, whose the Hamiltonian accounts for the two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons instead of one-particle hybridization which takes into account in the original Anderson model. The 1D version of this model can be solved using the Bethe ansazt. It has been shown that hybridization between itinerant and frozen localized electrons results in an effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons. The magnitude and sign of this interaction depend on the position of the level relative to the Fermi energy (the energy of this level corresponds to the two-particle state of localized electrons at a site). It is shown that when the energy of an localized electron in the two-particle state lies above the Fermi energy, the effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons is attractive. A repulsive interaction between itinerant electrons occurs when this energy lies below the Fermi energy. Thus, two-part hybridization between localized and itinerant electrons can lead to effective attraction between itinerant electrons, which is unique in itself and may underlie the nature of high-temperature superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We consider an electron interacting locally with two-level systems (TLSs) as an archetypal model for charge transport in the presence of inelastic scatterers. To assess the importance of quantum effects in the optical and d.c. conductivity we solve the model numerically without approximations using the finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), and compare the results with Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). In the slow fluctuation limit, the coupling to the TLSs causes transient localization of the carriers analogous to the one recently found in the electron-boson scattering problem, featuring enhanced resistivities and displaced Drude peaks. Fast inelastic scatterers suppress localization, restoring a more conventional regime where transport and optical properties are governed by independent scattering events.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) magnets host a wide range of exotic magnetic textures, whose low-energy excitations and finite-temperature properties are typically described by effective spin models based on Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians. A key challenge in this framework is the reliable determination, from ab initio calculations, of exchange parameters and their anisotropic components, crucial for stabilising long-range order. Among the different strategies proposed for this task, the energy-mapping method -- based on total-energy calculations within Density Functional Theory (DFT) -- is the most widely adopted, but it typically requires laborious, multi-step procedures. To overcome this limitation, we introduce AMaRaNTA (Automating Magnetic paRAmeters iN a Tensorial Approach), a computational package that systematically automates the energy-mapping method, specifically through its ``four-state'' formulation, to extract exchange and anisotropy parameters in 2D magnets. In its current implementation, AMaRaNTA returns the nearest-neighbour exchange tensor, complemented by scalar parameters for second- and third-nearest-neighbour exchange interactions as well as single-ion anisotropy. Together, these provide a minimal yet sufficient set of parameters to capture magnetic frustration and anisotropies, essential for stabilising several observed magnetic states in 2D materials. Applied to a representative subset of the Materials Cloud 2D Structure database, AMaRaNTA demonstrates robust, automated and reproducible screening of magnetic interactions, with clear potential for high-throughput simulations.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the impact of correlated hopping on thermoelectric transport through a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads. Using the accurate numerical renormalization group method, we analyze the transport characteristics, focusing on the interplay between electronic correlations, spin-dependent transport processes, and thermoelectric response. We calculate the electrical conductance and thermopower as functions of the dot energy level, lead polarization, and the amplitude of correlated hopping. Moreover, we analyze the effect of competing correlations on the Kondo resonance and discuss the asymmetry of conductance peaks under the influence of the exchange field. We demonstrate that the presence of correlated hopping is responsible for asymmetric spin-dependent transport characteristics. Our results provide valuable insight into how correlated hopping affects spin-dependent transport and thermoelectric efficiency in quantum dot systems with ferromagnetic contacts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ihor Sukhenko, Volodymyr Karbivskyy</p>
            <p>We develop a DFT screening procedure for copper-substituted lead apatites of the composition Pb$_9$Cu(XO$_4$)$_6$Y that enforces three design rules: thermodynamic stability, Cu site preference, and symmetry robustness of the near-Fermi electronic structure. A convex-hull analysis over P/V/As as X, O/F/Cl/Br as Y, identifies vanadates as the only members on or beneath the hull. Across the family, Cu substitution at Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($4f$) preserves flat bands at E$_F$, whereas Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($6h$) either gaps or severely distorts them. Small symmetry-lowering relaxations ($P3 \rightarrow P1$) are also capable of opening the band gap, motivating symmetry robustness as a filter. Applying these criteria singles out Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ (and, possibly, Cl$_2$) as leading candidates. This work motivates experimental study of the selected compounds, as well as a dedicated study of strong correlations.</p>

            <p>When neural networks are trained to classify a dataset, one finds a set of weights from which the network produces a label for each data point. We study the algorithmic complexity of finding a collision in a single-layer neural net, where a collision is defined as two distinct sets of weights that assign the same labels to all data. For binary perceptrons with oscillating activation functions, we establish the emergence of an overlap gap property in the space of collisions. This is a topological property believed to be a barrier to the performance of efficient algorithms. The hardness is supported by numerical experiments using approximate message passing algorithms, for which the algorithms stop working well below the value predicted by our analysis. Neural networks provide a new category of candidate collision resistant functions, which for some parameter setting depart from constructions based on lattices. Beyond relevance to cryptography, our work uncovers new forms of computational hardness emerging in large neural networks which may be of independent interest.</p>

            <p>Reaching a consensus on the superconducting order parameter of unconventional superconductors remains a central challenge in the field of magnetically-mediated superconductivity. Though UTe$_{2}$ is largely accepted as a rare example of an odd-parity superconductor, its precise order parameter remains highly debated, even at ambient conditions. A key underlying issue is the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties at zero applied pressure and magnetic field. Here, we investigate the origin of the observed variation by means of single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Our results reveal highly ordered crystalline lattices, in agreement with the expected $Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. Tiny amounts of interstitial defects, however, are observed on the Te2 layers that host Te chains along the b axis. We argue that these defects give rise to slightly enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are enough to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$. Our findings highlight the need to focus future order parameter determination efforts on single crystals of UTe$_{2}$ with minimal amounts of structural disorder.</p>

            <p>Methods of elucidating the mechanisms of fast-ion conduction in solid-state materials are pivotal for advancements in energy technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and supercapacitors. In this study, we examine the ionic conduction pathways in single crystal SrCl$_2$, which is a fast-ion conductor above 900~K, using four-dimensional Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (4D-QENS). We explore both coherent and incoherent neutron scattering at temperatures above the transition temperature into the superionic phase to explore the correlated motion of hopping anions. Refinements of the incoherent QENS yield residence times and jump probabilities between lattice sites in good agreement with previous studies, confirming that ionic hopping along nearest-neighbor directions is the most probable conduction pathway. However, the coherent QENS reveals evidence of de Gennes narrowing, indicating the importance of ionic correlations in the conduction mechanism. This highlights the need for improvements both in the theory of ionic transport in fluorite compounds and the modeling of coherent 4D-QENS in single crystals.</p>

            <p>We report on an experimental investigation of the interplay between friction, adhesion, contact geometry, and finite strains for smooth frictional contacts between rigid spherical glass probes and flat silicone substrates. Using both bulk and layer substrates under various loading conditions (normal force, radius of the probe), we show that shear-induced anisotropic shrinkage of the adhesive contact area under steady-state sliding is an effect of finite-elasticity conditions and is drastically affected by the level of geometric confinement. The resulting non-linear coupling between the normal and lateral directions is also investigated measuring the changes in the indentation depth (conv. normal load) during the stiction of the adhesive contacts under imposed normal load (conv. indentation depth) conditions, with strong effects of contact confinement. From a comparison with adhesiveless linear contact mechanics calculations, we show that the experimental observations can only be accounted for by the occurrence of finite strains/displacements conditions. Accordingly, measurements of the in-plane surface displacements at the surface of the rubber substrates confirm that strain levels well in the neo-Hookean range are experienced during steady-state frictional sliding.</p>

            <p>As a consequence of their spin-orbit entangled ground state, many $5d^{5}$ iridate materials display a peculiar double peak structure in optical transport quantities, such as absorption and conductivity. Their common interpretation is based on the presence of Hubbard subbands in the half-filled $j_{\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$ manifold. Herein, we challenge this picture, proposing a scenario based on the presence of spin-polaron (SP) quasiparticles, and assigning a dominant SP character to the first peak. We illustrate it by taking the materials Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ as paradigmatic examples, which we investigate within the dynamical mean-field theory and the self-consistent Born approximation. Both theories reproduce nontrivial features revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical transport measurements, supporting our interpretation. In the case of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, we show how the SP scenario survives in the low-doped regime. Similar optical transport fingerprints are expected to be found in the wider class of $5d^5$ iridates and more generally in strongly correlated antiferromagnetic regimes, such as those found in cuprates.</p>

            <p>Geometric frustration can significantly increase the complexity and richness of many-body physics and, for instance, suppress antiferromagnetic order in quantum magnets. Here, we employ ultracold bosonic $^{39}$K atoms in a triangular optical lattice to study geometric frustration by stabilizing the gas at the frustrated upper band edge using negative absolute temperatures. We find that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength for the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase transition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics of the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from MI to the ($\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than a few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \frs case, no long-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a significantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence. This work opens the door to quantum simulations of frustrated systems that are often intractable by classical simulations.</p>

            <p>The so-called multilayer wave functions were introduced in the study of the fractional Quantum Hall effect by Halperin and others. They are defined with the help of a symmetric matrix $K$ in $M^k(\mathbb{N})$, which encodes the couplings between the $k$ layers where particles live. We study the multilayer quantum states in the case where each layer is a Riemann surface of genus $g$. These states form a vector bundle over the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface, or the space of Aharonov-Bohm fluxes in physics terminology. Burban-Klevtsov have determined the rank and first Chern class of this bundle when $g=1$, and Klevtsov-Zvonkine computed the Chern character of this bundle in the single layer case for any genus. We generalize the latter approach to the multilayer case and compute the Chern character of the multilayer bundle for any genus, and any possible number of non-localized quasi-holes, under the assumption that the bilinear form associated to $K-I$ is non negative. The key tools are the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula, Berezin integration and Wick's formula for exterior algebras. We show that when all quasi-holes are localized, the Chern character is compatible with the bundle being projectively flat. Furthermore, for those configurations, the conductance becomes independent of the genus and is equal to the sum of the coefficients of the inverse matrix $K^{-1}$, proving two conjectures by Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. We also find the relation linking $K$, the genus of the surface, the magnetic field and the number of non-localized quasi holes in each layer, which was studied under the name of ''shift formula''. Finally, we study conditions on the matrix $K$ under which states having only localized quasi-holes maximize the total particle number, as well as the asymptotics for large magnetic fields in this scenario.</p>

Under these conditions the EDG equations are known to have global solutions. We establish a law of large numbers for the empirical measures, showing that the solutions of the EDG equation describe the limiting distribution of cluster sizes in the particle system. Furthermore, we analyse the dynamics of tagged particles and prove convergence to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process governed by a nonlinear master equation, derived via a law of large numbers for size-biased empirical processes.</p>

Such systems are exposed to both internal, localized, failures and external disturbances or perturbations. Owing to their interconnected structure, complex systems might be severely degraded, to the point of disintegration or systemic dysfunction. Examples include cascading failures, triggered by an initially localized overload in power systems, and the critical slowing downs of ecosystems which can be driven towards extinction. In recent years, this general phenomenon has been investigated by framing localized and systemic failures in terms of perturbations that can alter the function of a system. We capitalize on this mathematical framework to review theoretical and computational approaches to characterize robustness and resilience of complex networks. We discuss recent approaches to mitigate the impact of perturbations in terms of designing robustness, identifying early-warning signals and adapting responses. In terms of applications, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art dismantling techniques, highlighting their optimal range of applicability for practical problems, and provide a repository with ready-to-use scripts, a much-needed tool set.</p>

            <p>Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Harshit Sharma, Sashmita Rout, Avadhut V. Purohit, Udaysinh T. Bhosale</p>
            <p>We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.</p>

            <p>The recent progress in nanosheet transistors has established two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors as viable candidates for future ultra-scaled electronic devices. Next to reducing contact resistance, identifying good gate dielectrics is a fundamental challenge, as the dielectric/channel interface dramatically impacts virtually all performance parameters. While several promising gate dielectrics have recently been reported, the evaluation of their quality and suitability is often fragmentary and focused on selected important performance metrics of the gate stack, such as the capacitive gate control, leakage currents, reliability, and ease of fabrication and integration. However, identifying a suitable gate stack is a complex problem that has not yet been approached systematically. In this perspective, we aim to formulate general criteria for good gate dielectrics.</p>

            <h2>Ising dynamics on multilayer networks with heterogeneous layers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Suman S. Kulkarni, Christopher W. Lynn, Mason A. Porter, Dani S. Bassett</p>
            <p>Multilayer networks provide a framework to study complex systems with multiple types of interactions, multiple dynamical processes, and/or multiple subsystems. When studying a dynamical process on a multilayer network, it is important to consider how both layer structure and heterogeneity across layers impacts the overall dynamics. As a concrete example, we study Ising dynamics on multilayer networks and investigate how network structure affects its qualitative features. We focus primarily on multiplex networks, which are multilayer networks in which interlayer edges occur only between manifestations of the same entity on different layers, although we also consider one empirical example with a more general multilayer structure. We use numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation to examine the steady-state behavior of the Ising dynamics as a function of temperature (which is a key model parameter) for a variety of two-layer multilayer networks from both models and empirical data. We examine both the steady-state behavior and a metastable state in which the two layers are anti-aligned, and we explore the effects of interlayer coupling strength and structural heterogeneity. In synthetic multilayer networks with core--periphery structure, we show that interlayer edges that involve peripheral nodes can exert more influence than interlayer edges that involve only core nodes. Finally, we consider empirical multilayer networks from biological and social systems. Our work illustrates how heterogeneity across the layers of a multilayer network influences dynamics on the whole network.</p>

            <h2>Pressure shifts in large-amplitude pulsatile shear flow: A microfluidic method to probe the normal stress response of complex fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Rodrigues, F. J. Galindo-Rosales, L. Campo-Deaño</p>
            <p>A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in pulsatile shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight, deformable microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift from pressure-controlled large-amplitude pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.</p>

            <h2>Fidelity zeros and Lee-Yang theory of quantum phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tian-Yi Gu, Gaoyong Sun</p>
            <p>Lee-Yang theory is central to the analysis of thermal phase transitions. However, the underlying mechanism of the theory and the nature of Lee-Yang zeros in quantum many-body systems remains elusive. Here, we develop a unified framework for understanding quantum phase transitions from fidelity zeros induced by symmetry breaking. These zeros, arising from transitions between symmetry sectors, obey the Lee-Yang theorem and give rise to fidelity edges near critical points. Quantum criticality is further characterized through the finite-size scaling of fidelity zeros. As concrete examples, we analytically and numerically investigate fidelity zeros in one- and two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising models under a complex magnetic field. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of Lee-Yang theory and open avenues for exploring unexplored landscapes of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Extended Low-Rank Approximation Accelerates Learning of Elastic Response in Heterogeneous Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Prabhat Karmakar, Sayan Gupta, Ilaksh Adlakha</p>
            <p>Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results across representative material systems, including two phase composites and single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary, xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.</p>

            <h2>Particle-hole asymmetric phases in doped twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Run Hou, Shouvik Sur, Lucas K. Wagner, Andriy H. Nevidomskyy</p>
            <p>Despite much theoretical work, developing a comprehensive ab initio model for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has proven challenging due to the inherent trade-off between accurately describing the band structure and incorporating the interactions within the Hamiltonian, particularly given the topological obstruction -- so-called fragile topology -- to the description of the model in terms of localized symmetric Wannier functions within the flat band manifold. Here, we circumvent this obstruction by using an extended 8-orbital model, for which localized Wannier orbitals have been formulated by Carr et al. [1]. We constructed an extended multi-orbital Hubbard model, and performed Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations to explore its phase diagram across commensurate fillings from -3 to 3. We found several nearly-degenerate insulating states at charge neutrality, all of which exhibit orbital orders. Crucially, TBG near magic angle is known to be particle-hole asymmetric, which is naturally captured by the single-particle band structure of our model and is reflected in the distinction between the symmetry broken states obtained at electron and hole dopings away from the charge neutral point. At filling -1 and +2, quantum anomalous hall states are obtained, while for the rest of the integer fillings away from charge neutrality, we found the system to realize metallic states with various orbital, valley and spin orderings. We also observed that most of the Hartree--Fock ground states exhibit a generalized valley Hund's-like rule, resulting in valley polarization. Importantly, we show that the incorporation of the intra-valley and inter-valley exchange interactions is crucial to properly stabilize the ordered symmetry-broken states. In agreement with experiments, we find significant particle-hole asymmetry, which underscores the importance of using particle-hole asymmetric models.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Fractional Chern Insulators and Competing States in Flat Moiré Bands</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hui Liu, Zhao Liu, Emil J. Bergholtz</p>
            <p>Breakthrough experiments have recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moiré materials. However, all states observed are Abelian, the possible existence of more exotic non-Abelian FCIs remains controversial both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we investigate the competition between charge density wave (CDW) order, gapless composite fermion liquid (CFL), and non-Abelian Moore-Read states at half-filling of a moiré band. Although groundstate (quasi-)degeneracies and spectral flow are not sufficient for distinguishing between charge order and Moore-Read states, we find evidence using entanglement spectroscopy that both these states of matter can be realized with Coulomb interactions. By further analyzing the graviton excitations of Moore-Read states, we unveil that the ground states exhibit a mixed behavior of Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, despite the weak breaking of particle-hole symmetry. In a double twisted bilayer graphene model, transitions between these phases can be driven by the coupling strength between the layers: at weak coupling there is a CFL phase and at strong coupling a CDW order emerges. Remarkably, however, there is compelling evidence for a non-Abelian Moore-Read FCI phase at intermediate coupling.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics of pulsating active liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tirthankar Banerjee, Thibault Desaleux, Jonas Ranft, Étienne Fodor</p>
            <p>Inspired by dense contractile tissues, where cells are subject to periodic deformation, we formulate and study a generic hydrodynamic theory of pulsating active liquids. Combining mechanical and phenomenological arguments, we postulate that the mechanochemical feedback between the local phase, which describes how cells deform due to autonomous driving, and the local density can be described in terms of a free energy. We demonstrate that such a feedback is compatible with the coarse-graining of a broad class of microscopic models. Our hydrodynamics captures the three main states emerging in its particle-based counterparts: a globally cycling state, a homogeneous arrested state with constant phase, and a state with propagating radial waves. Remarkably, we show that the competition between these states can be rationalized intuitively in terms of an effective landscape, and argue that waves can be regarded as secondary instabilities. Linear stability analysis of the arrested and cycling states, including the role of fluctuations, leads to predictions for the phase boundaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that our minimal, yet non-trivial model provides a relevant platform to study the rich phenomenology of pulsating liquids.</p>

            <h2>Entropic Clustering of Stickers Induces Aging in Biocondensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hugo Le Roy, Paolo De Los Rios</p>
            <p>Biomolecular condensates are cellular phase-separated droplets that usually exhibit a viscoelastic mechanical response. A behavior rationalized by modeling the complex molecules that make up a condensate as stickers and spacers, which assemble into a network-like structure. Condensates usually exhibit a solidification over a long period of time (days), a phenomenon described as this http URL emergence of such a long timescale of evolution from microscopic processes, as well as the associated microscopic reorganization leading to aging, remains mostly an open question. In this article, we explore the connection between the mechanical properties of the condensates and their microscopic structure. We propose a minimal model for the dynamic of stickers and spacers, and show that entropy maximization of spacers leads to an attractive force between stickers. Our system displays a surprisingly slow relaxation toward equilibrium, reminiscent of glassy systems and consistent with the liquid-to-solid transition observed. To explain this behavior, we study the clustering dynamic of stickers and successfully explain the origin of glassy relaxation.</p>

            <h2>Interaction dependence of the Hall response for the Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Catalin-Mihai Halati, Thierry Giamarchi</p>
            <p>We explore the behavior of the Hall response of a Bose-Hubbard triangular ladder in a magnetic field as a function of the repulsive on-site atomic interactions. We consider a wide range of interaction strengths, from the weakly interacting limit to the hardcore regime. This is realized by computing the Hall polarization following the quench of a weak linear potential which induces the flow of a current through the system, using time-dependent matrix product state numerical simulations. We complement our understanding in the regime of small magnetic fields by analytical calculations of the equilibrium value of the Hall polarization for non-interacting bosonic atoms, or under a mean-field assumption. The Bose-Hubbard triangular flux ladder exhibits a rich phase diagram, containing Meissner, vortex and biased-chiral superfluid phases. We show that the Hall response can be employed to fingerprint the various chiral state, the frustration effects occurring in the limit of strong interactions, and the phase boundaries of the equilibrium phase diagram.</p>

            <p>Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive a first known upper bound on fluctuations of state observables, as well as some new lower bounds. We further demonstrate how our identities provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic origin of fluctuations and reveal their properties dependent only on system topology, which may be relevant for model inference using measured data.</p>
