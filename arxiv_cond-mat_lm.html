            <h2>Turbulent Flows in Electron Hydrodynamics: Conductivity and Vorticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanad Bhattacharya</p>
            <p>In this article, we attempt to understand various aspects of turbulent flows in electron hydrodynamics. We analyze a rectangular channel geometry in the presence of an electric field and a Corbino geometry in the presence of a magnetic field. In the former geometry, we analyze the conductivity of the fluid as well as the frequency spectrum of perturbations about the Poiseuille flow. While the normal Poiseuille flow has an associated conductivity which scales as $W^2$, we find a correction which scales as $W^4$ in the case of non-linear flows, where $W$ is the characteristic length of the system. In the Corbino geometry, we analyze the velocity, vorticity and magnetic fields. We find that the vorticity can span across a wide range near the edge of the geometry, a behavior that can be reflected in the velocity and magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Attention-Based Foundation Model for Quantum States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timothy Zaklama, Daniele Guerci, Liang Fu</p>
            <p>We present an attention-based foundation model architecture for learning and predicting quantum states across Hamiltonian parameters, system sizes, and physical systems. Using only basis configurations and physical parameters as inputs, our trained neural network is able to produce highly accurate ground state wavefunctions. For example, we build the phase diagram for the 2D square-lattice $t-V$ model with $N$ particles, from only 18 parameters $(V/t,N)$. Thus, our architecture provides a basis for building a universal foundation model for quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>van der Waals Nanoreactors</h2>

            <p>Advancing the chemical synthesis of crystals is important for both fundamental research and practical applications of quantum materials. While established bulk-phase and thin-film growth methods have enabled enormous progress, synthesizing single crystals suitable for quantum electronic discoveries remains challenging for many emerging materials. Here, we introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for single-crystal synthesis and demonstrate their broad applicability in growing both elemental and compound crystals at the micrometer scale. By encapsulating atomically thin reactants that are stacked compactly with inert vdW layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we achieve nanoconfined synthesis with the resulting crystals remaining encapsulated. As proof of concept, we synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of Pd-Te compounds. Structural characterization, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirms the high crystalline quality of the products. We confirm the intrinsic semiconducting gap of tellurium and observe that non-stoichiometric PdTe1-x with a significantly reduced Te content (x ~ 0.18, a regime not previously achieved) retains uniform crystallinity and exhibits superconductivity below a critical temperature of 3.8 K. This nanochemical synthesis is broadly generalizable, chip-integrable, well-suited to a wide range of processing conditions, and compatible with nanofabrication routines for constructing devices. The concept of vdW nanoreactors offers a powerful and versatile pathway to expand the accessible landscape of quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Perturbative Input-Output Theory of Floquet Cavity Magnonics and Magnon Energy Shifts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Aguiar, M. C. de Oliveira</p>
            <p>We develop a perturbative input-output formalism to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra of cavity magnonics systems subject to a Floquet modulation. The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $\epsilon = (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $\epsilon$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Quantum Photonic Platform Based on Site-Controlled Quantum Dots Coupled to Circular Bragg Grating Resonators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartik Gaur, Avijit Barua, Sarthak Tripathi, Léo J. Roche, Steffen Wilksen, Alexander Steinhoff, Sam Baraz, Neha Nitin, Chirag C. Palekar, Aris Koulas-Simos, Imad Limame, Priyabrata Mudi, Sven Rodt, Christopher Gies, Stephan Reitzenstein</p>
            <p>The scalable integration of solid-state quantum emitters into photonic nanostructures remains a central challenge for quantum photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust and streamlined integration strategy that tackles the long-standing issue of deterministic fabrication on randomly positioned self-assembled quantum dots (QDs), leveraging a buried-stressor-based site-controlled InGaAs QD platform. We show that this deterministic growth approach enables precise spatial alignment with circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators for enhanced emission, eliminating the need for complex and time-consuming deterministic lithography techniques. We fabricated a $6\times6$ SCQD-CBG array with 100\% device yield, with 35 devices falling within the radial-offset range where the simulated photon-extraction efficiency (PEE) exceeds 20\%, underscoring the spatial precision and scalability of our fabrication concept. A systematically selected subset of five devices with varying radial displacements reveals clear offset-dependent trends in extraction efficiency, spectral linewidth, and photon indistinguishability, thereby establishing quantitative bounds on spatial alignment tolerances. In the best-aligned QD-CBG device, we achieve a PEE of $(47.1\pm3.8)\%$, a linewidth of $(1.41\pm0.22)$ GHz, a radiative decay lifetime of $(0.80\pm0.02)$~ns, a single-photon purity of $(99.58\pm0.18)\%$, and a Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference visibility of $(81\pm5)\%$ under quasi-resonant excitation at saturation power. We confirm our conceptual understanding of the effect of emitter-position dependent charge-noise fluctuations in terms of a quantum-optical model for the (quantum-)emission properties.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-assisted topological pumping in few- and many-atom Rydberg arrays</h2>

            <p>Topology can imbue lattice systems with special properties, notably the presence of robust eigenstates living at their boundary. Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Rational Design Principles for Na- and Li-ion Carbon Anodes from Interlayer Spacing Control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ihor Radchenko (1), Oleksandr I. Malyi (1 and 2) ((1) Centre of Excellence ENSEMBLE3 Sp. z o. o., (2) Qingyuan Innovation Laboratory)</p>
            <p>Graphite, the standard commercial anode for Li-ion batteries, is thermodynamically incompatible with Na-ion batteries, leading researchers to search for alternative C-based structures (e.g., hard carbon, expanded graphite). In a simplified picture, the main idea of such search relies on identifying disordered C structures with a large interlayer spacing and distribution of local structural motifs (e.g., pores) with target electrochemical properties. Such exploration is typically done via trial-and-error experimentation, which often does not allow precise understanding of the role of interlayer distance and even Na/Li-ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance. Motivated by this, using density-functional theory and cluster expansion, we establish a structure-property relationship for Li- and Na-intercalation across a range of graphite interlayer spacings and stacking arrangements. We show that Na intercalation becomes thermodynamically possible in large concentrations above 4.21 Å even without a change in interlayer spacing. Conversely, Li intercalation has a narrow optimal window, with maximum capacity (close to the commercial limit) at approximately 3.75 Å, while larger spacings (e.g., 4.58 Å) quickly reduce Li storage capacity. We also find that AA-stacked domains consistently offer stronger ion bonding and higher voltages than AB-stacked domains for both ions. Our results, thus, not only explain the role of metal ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance, but also clarify the fundamental design trade-offs for expanded C anodes, offering practical targets and interlayer distance ranges for the independent optimization of the next generation of negative electrodes for metal-ion batteries.</p>

            <h2>Many-Body Correlation Effects in Fröhlich Electron-Phonon Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zien Zhu, Chih-En Hsu, Benran Zhang, Zhenfa Zheng, Mauro Del Ben, Antonios M. Alvertis, Hung-Chung Hsueh, Zhenglu Li</p>
            <p>In compound semiconductors and insulators, the polar electron-phonon coupling diverges at long range, known as the Fröhlich interaction. Modern first-principles electron-phonon calculations treat the Fröhlich interaction in a semiclassical electrostatic formalism based on density-functional perturbation theory. Here, using many-body $GW$ perturbation theory, we reveal important electron correlation effects in the Fröhlich-type electron-phonon coupling, which are missed by the prevailing approaches. Going beyond the electrostatic treatment, we derive and implement the $GW$ self-energy contribution to the long-range polar electron-phonon coupling, and demonstrate its critical role and nontrivial behaviors in properties such as electron linewidth and polaron formation. Our work establishes the many-body generalization of the Fröhlich interaction that is essential for accurate electron-phonon calculations at the full $GW$ level combined with Wannier interpolation techniques.</p>

            <h2>Strain-induced quantum oscillation in Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana-Fermi surface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takayuki Yokoyama, Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.</p>

            <h2>Extreme disorder in crystalline perovskite oxide: a new paradigm in quantum materials research</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Srimanta Middey, Nandana Bhattacharya, Rukma Nevgi, Suresh Chandra Joshi, Subha Dey</p>
            <p>Perovskite oxides ($AB$O$_3$) have long been central to the advancement of modern condensed matter physics, owing to their rich and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. The quest to understand their various entangled phases has spurred the development of both cutting-edge experimental tools and innovative theoretical frameworks. In recent times, the emergence of high entropy oxides - materials in which five or more elements share a single crystallographic site - has introduced a powerful new paradigm in materials design. Embedding such extreme chemical disorder within the perovskite framework has opened vast opportunities for realizing novel physical phenomena inaccessible in conventional oxides. This review surveys the rapid advances in the synthesis, characterization, and exploration of the electronic and magnetic properties of compositionally complex perovskite oxides, offering key insights and highlighting promising avenues for future research.</p>

            <h2>From chessboard of bipolarons of size 4a in cubic La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 to stripes of the same bipolarons in layered high Tc cuprates</h2>

            <p>The compound La1-xSrxMnO3 exhibits a charge order (CO) state at $x\approx 1/8$ and $T<T_{co}$, which recalls the CO state with a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting transition, $T_c$, observed in all cuprates at this doping value. Local excitations of lattice and magnetic origins measured in the two-dimensional metallic state of La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 reveal the existence of bipolarons of size $4a$ resulting from structural and antiferromagnetic pairings of hole-rich orbital polarons of size $2a$. They are intertwined with hole-poor domains in a disordered state at $T>T_{co}$ which become ordered on a chessboard organized in a 3D-order state of ferromagnetically paired polarons at $T<T_{co}$. Applied to the CuO$_2$ planes of the cuprates of the "214" family, this model produces stripes of bipolarons intertwined with stripes of antiferromagnetically arranged spins, hole-poor, both of size $4a$, leading to a spin density wave with a wave vector $\delta=1/8$, a charge density wave with $q=1/4$, the Yamada laws $\delta(x)=x$ and $T_c\propto \delta$ and a decrease of $T_c$ at x=1/8. This work invokes relevance of a bipolaronic origin of high $T_c$ superconductivity, in which bipolarons of size $4a$ can play a major role.</p>

            <h2>Discriminating Gap Symmetries of Superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhan Wang, Yuxin Wang, Kun Jiang, Jiangping Hu, Fu-Chun Zhang</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductor in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate materials represented by La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened new directions in the quest for unconventional superconductivity. A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu</p>
            <p>The magnetoelectric coupling effect serves as a crucial bridge between electrical and magnetic order parameters in condensed matter physics, forming the physical basis for the development of next-generation low-power information storage and sensing technologies. However, material systems exhibiting this effect at room temperature are extremely rare, and the coupling strength is typically very weak, which has long hindered the practical application of such phenomena despite their rich tunability. Here, we break this by reporting a pronounced magnetoelectric phenomenon,the magnetically coupled EO effect in the classic ferroelectric optical materials LiNbO3 and LiTaO3. We trace its origin to an unexpected source,the problematic direct current drift,a major reliability issue in photonic integrated circuits. We unambiguously demonstrate that this drift stems not from mobile ions but from defect-bound unpaired electrons, whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched upon the magnetic-field-induced formation of a room-temperature skyrmion states, as directly visualized by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. This collective spin ordering not only solves the decades-old drift problem but also transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, exhibiting an efficiency up to 34 pm/V in LiNbO3 and 15 pm/V in LiTaO3-an orders-of-magnitude enhancement over conventional room-temperature magnetoelectric responses and even surpassing the materials' intrinsic Pockels coefficients. We also measured the magnetic response of this additional electro-optical effect and found that under the condition of applying a magnetic field of 0.1 T, an electro-optical coefficient adjustment of about 8 pm/V can be achieved (0.008 pm/V/Oe), which is equivalent to 30% of the electro-optical coefficient of LiNbO3 itself.</p>

            <h2>Observation of a Stripe/nematic Phase of Composite Fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chengyu Wang, Siddharth K. Singh, Chia-Tse Tai, Adbhut Gupta, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Kirk W. Baldwin, Mansour Shayegan</p>
            <p>Electronic stripe/nematic phases are fascinating strongly-correlated states characterized by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $\nu=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $\nu=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles. This phase is surprisingly robust, surviving up to $\sim$100 mK. Its absence in electron-type systems suggests that severe LL mixing stemming from the large hole effective mass and non-linear LL fan diagram plays a crucial role in modifying the CF-CF interaction.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) diamond has aroused tremendous interest in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, owing to its superior properties and flexible characteristics compared to bulk diamond. Despite significant efforts, great challenges lie in the experimental synthesis and transformation conditions of 2D diamond. Herein, we have demonstrated the experimental preparation of high quality 2D diamond with controlled thickness and distinguished properties, realized by laser-heating few-layer graphene in diamond anvil cell. The quenched 2D diamond exhibited narrow T2g Raman peak (linewidth ~3.6 cm-1) and intense photoluminescence of SiV- (linewidth ~6.1 nm) and NV0 centers. In terms of transformation mechanism, atomic structures of hybrid phase interfaces suggested that the intermediate rhombohedral phase subtly mediate hexagonal graphite to cubic diamond transition. Furthermore, the tunable optical bandgap and thermal stability of 2D diamond sensitively depend on its sp3 concentration. We believe our results can shed light on the structural design and preparation of many carbon allotropes and further uncover the underlying transition mechanism.</p>

            <h2>Predicting the Thermal Conductivity Collapse in SWCNT Bundles: The Interplay of Symmetry Breaking and Scattering Revealed by Machine-Learning-Driven Quantum Transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Feng Tao, Xiaoliang Zhang, Dawei Tang, Shigeo Maruyama, Ya Feng</p>
            <p>We combine machine learning (ML)-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE) to achieve a quantitative and mode-resolved description of thermal transport in individual (10, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their bundles. Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.</p>

            <h2>Electric fields induced spin and/or valley polarization in Weiss oscillations of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Y. Li, W. Zeng, R. Shen</p>
            <p>Monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magneto-conductivity of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ by using the linear response theory. It is shown that the Weiss oscillations are polarized in spin and valley degrees of freedom, under uniform electric fields and a weak one-dimensional spatially-periodic electrostatic potential modulation. The spin polarization, the valley polarization and the spin-valley polarization can be switched by flipping the external electric fields. The polarization is found not only in the amplitudes but also in the periods of the Weiss oscillations. It is found that the period polarization in Weiss oscillations originates from the polarized effective Fermi energies or the polarized Landau level spacing scales. In Weiss oscillations, polarization in amplitude does not imply the presence of polarization in period, whereas polarization in period is accompanied by polarization in amplitude. The superposition of polarization in amplitude and polarization in period enables the appearance of considerable polarization in Weiss oscillations under relatively weak external electric fields.</p>

            <p>The interplay between magnetic order, charge dynamics, and crystal field excitations underpins the emergent ground states of rare-earth intermetallics. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, we probe this coupling in PrSi, a metallic ferromagnet. The optical response exhibits pronounced Drude-Smith behavior over a broad temperature range, indicating persistent carrier scattering. A classical Kondo-lattice model (CKLM) attributes this non-Drude conductivity to scattering of itinerant electrons by localized magnetic moments, persisting down to temperatures well below the magnetic ordering scale. At lower temperatures, beyond the scope of CKLM, our experiment reveals that the response is dominated by crystal-field excitations, with sharp transitions at 0.6 THz and 1.54 THz. The mode at 1.54 THz shows a dynamic correlation with the onset of ferromagnetic order, marking the onset of a crystal-field-governed low temperature regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dong Hui Han, Kyoung-Woong Moon, Kab-Jin Kim, Se Kwon Kim</p>
            <p>The dynamics of a cycloidal spin structure driven by an AC magnetic field is theoretically studied in the weak-field limit. A specific model Hamiltonian describing the cycloidal spin structure in a ferromagnetic thin film is constructed, and its dynamics is analyzed using the collective-coordinate approach within the Lagrangian formalism. We demonstrate that the cycloidal spin structure exhibits a unidirectional gliding motion under an AC magnetic field, and an expression for the average velocity is derived as a function of the magnitude, the direction, and the frequency of the AC magnetic field. We compare our theoretical predictions with the results of micromagnetic simulations and identify two resonance frequencies determined by the eigenenergies of the excitation modes. Furthermore, evaluating spin motive forces induced by the dynamics reveals a substantial DC voltage, which may be exploited in energy-harvesting devices utilizing ambient electromagnetic radiation.</p>

Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.</p>

            <h2>3D lattice Monte Carlo modeling of morphology formation of Si/SiOx nanocomposites during phase separation of nonstoichiometric Si oxide films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ivan Oliinyk, Andrey Sarikov</p>
            <p>In this paper, a three-dimensional lattice model based on the Monte Carlo approach is presented. This model is developed to investigate the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric Si oxide (SiOx, x < 2) films. The model takes into account the SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic migration of oxygen atoms driven by the tendency of free energy minimization. The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x >= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x <= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm.</p>

            <h2>Microscopic Theory of a Fluctuation-Induced Dynamical Crossover in Supercooled Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Corentin C. L. Laudicina, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen, Grzegorz Szamel</p>
            <p>Mean-field theories of the glass transition predict a phase transition to a dynamically arrested state, yet no such transition is observed in experiments or simulations of finite-dimensional systems. We resolve this long-standing discrepancy by incorporating critical dynamical fluctuations into a microscopic mode-coupling framework. We show that these fluctuations round off the mean-field singularity and restore ergodicity at all finite densities (or temperatures) without invoking activated dynamics or facilitation. The resulting effective theory describes the order parameter as a stochastic process with self-induced, annealed disorder, determined self-consistently at the mean-field level. In the $\beta$-relaxation regime it reduces to stochastic beta-relaxation theory, thereby unifying mode-coupling and replica-based approaches beyond mean-field. All parameters of the stochastic $\beta$-relaxation theory are fixed by the static structure, enabling parameter-free predictions that extend mean-field theory into finite dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Theory of the $β$-Relaxation Beyond Mode-Coupling Theory: A Microscopic Treatment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Corentin C. L. Laudicina, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen, Grzegorz Szamel</p>
            <p>We develop a systematic extension of mode-coupling theory (MCT) that incorporates critical dynamical fluctuations. Starting from a microscopic diagrammatic theory, we identify dominant classes of divergent diagrams near the mode-coupling transition and show that the corresponding asymptotic series dominates the mean-field below an upper critical dimension $d_c=8$. To resum these divergences, we construct a mapping to a stochastic dynamical process in which the order parameter evolves under random spatiotemporal fields. This reformulation provides a controlled, fully dynamical derivation of an effective theory for the $\beta$-relaxation which remarkably coincides with stochastic beta-relaxation theory [T. Rizzo, EPL 106, 56003 (2014)]. All coupling constants of the latter theory are expressed microscopically in terms of the liquid static structure factor and are computed for the paradigmatic hard-sphere system. The analysis demonstrates that fluctuations alone restore ergodicity and replace the putative mean-field transition by a smooth crossover. Our results establish a predictive framework for structural relaxation beyond mean-field.</p>

            <p>Understanding the dynamical response of quantum materials is central to revealing their microscopic properties, yet access to long-time and large-scale dynamics remains severely limited by rapidly growing computational costs and entanglement, particularly in gapless systems. Here we introduce an autoregressive machine-learning framework that enables the extrapolation of dynamical spin correlations in both time and space beyond the reach of conventional numerical methods. Trained on time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations of the gapless XXZ model, our approach is benchmarked against exact solutions available for this analytically solvable system. Combined with physics-informed spatial extension, multi-layer perceptron model using ReLU activation functions has been shown to be superior than convolutional neural networks and linear regressions for longer time extrapolation. Perturbation study of error accumulation further demonstrates that our autoregressive neural network extrapolations are highly robust to perturbations, suggesting stable and reliable predictions. This work establishes a new paradigm for studying the dynamics of gapless quantum many-body systems, in which machine learning extends and complements the capabilities of state-of-the-art numerical approaches.</p>

            <h2>Topological descriptor for interpretable thermal transport prediction in amorphous graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kosuke Yamazaki, Takuma Shiga, Kumpei Shiraishi, Emi Minamitani</p>
            <p>Understanding and predicting thermal transport in disordered materials remains a significant challenge due to the absence of periodicity and the complex nature of medium-range structural motifs. In this work, we investigate amorphous graphene and demonstrate that persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique, can serve as a physically interpretable structural descriptor for predicting thermal conductivity. We first show that ridge regression using persistent homology descriptors achieves high prediction accuracy. To gain physical insight into the prediction process, we perform inverse analysis by mapping the regression coefficients back onto the persistence diagrams. This reveals that distorted hexagonal and triangular motifs are strongly correlated with reduced thermal conductivity. A further comparison with the spatial distribution of localized vibrational modes supports the physical interpretation that these motifs suppress thermal transport. Our findings highlight that persistent homology not only enables accurate prediction of physical properties but also uncovers meaningful structure-property relationships in two-dimensional amorphous materials. This approach offers a promising framework for interpretable machine-learning models in materials science.</p>

            <p>Topological materials exhibit unique electronic structures that underpin both fundamental quantum phenomena and next-generation technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Recent machine-learning approaches, such as the heuristic topogivity rule, offer data-driven alternatives by quantifying each element's intrinsic tendency toward topological behavior. Here, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid artificial neural network (QANN) that extends this rule into a quantum-inspired formulation. Within this framework, the QANN maps compositional descriptors to quantum probability amplitudes, naturally introducing pairwise inter-element correlations inaccessible to classical heuristics. The physical validity of these correlations is substantiated by constructing an equivalent complex-valued neural network (CVNN), confirming both the consistency and interpretability of the formulation. Retaining the simplicity of chemical reasoning while embedding quantum-native features, our quantum-inspired rule enables efficient and generalizable topological classification. High-throughput screening combined with first-principles (DFT) validation reveals five previously unreported topological compounds, demonstrating the enhanced predictive power and physical insight afforded by quantum-inspired heuristics.</p>

            <h2>Vertex Model Mechanics Explain the Emergence of Centroidal Voronoi Tiling in Epithelia</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sulaimaan Lim, Julien Vermot, Chiu Fan Lee</p>
            <p>Epithelia are confluent cell layers that self-organize into polygonal networks whose geometry encodes their mechanical state. A principal driver is the tunable contractility of the actomyosin cortex, which links cell-junction tension to tissue architecture. Notably, epithelial tilings frequently resemble centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs), yet the physical origin of this resemblance has remained unclear. Here, using a minimal vertex model that relates cell shape to a mechanical energy, we show that CVT-like patterns arise naturally in the solid (rigid) regime of tissues. Analytical theory reveals that isotropic strain minimization drives cell centroids toward Voronoi configurations, a result we corroborate with a analytical mean-field formulation of the vertex model. We further demonstrate that physiologically relevant perturbations -- such as cyclic stretch -- shift tissues into distinct, geometrically disordered CVT states, and that these shifts provide quantitative, image-based readouts of mechanical state. Together, our results identify a mechanical origin for CVT-like organization in epithelia and establish a geometric framework that infers tissue stresses directly from morphology, offering broadly applicable metrics for assessing rigidity and remodeling in living tissues.</p>

            <p>We have measured the quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene samples that were exposed to a cold hydrogen plasma leading to a hydrogenation level of a few percent. Compared to pristine graphene, the Landau level distance significantly decreases in the hydrogenated structures, and its field dependence changes from square root type to linear. From this observation we conclude that the band structure in hydrogenated graphene changes from a linear Dirac-Weyl type dispersion to a quadratic one with an effective electron mass $m_e^* = 0.24~m_e$. This is in good agreement with ab-initio band structure calculations of hydrogen decorated graphene monolayer.</p>

            <p>Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) represent a class of crystalline materials for extreme environments. They can withstand extremely high temperatures but are mechanically difficult to work with due to their inherent brittleness. Mixture compounds, in particular high-entropy mixtures, offer a pathway to tune the physical properties of UHTCs such as their elastic constants. Here we fine-tune the MACE-MPA-0 universal machine-learning potential on rocksalt carbide UHTCs containing group IV-V metals and demonstrate that not only do the elastic constants deviate from the rule of mixtures approximation in the high-entropy limit, but also in the low-entropy limit of binary and ternary mixtures. We find that this is caused by distortion imposed by the lattice mismatch, enabling the tuning of the physical properties of UHTC mixtures in both low- and high-entropy compounds. We identify a three-component mixture compound, HfCVCZrC, as the best balance between synthesizability and toughness, and apply our developed MACE-UHTC model to identify a range of non-equimolar candidate compositions of this compound which may enable the synthesis of a mixture UHTC with a Young's modulus up to 40 GPa below that of ZrC.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P.I. Hurtado, J.J. del Pozo, P.L. Garrido</p>
            <p>Hydrodynamics provides a universal description of the emergent collective dynamics of vastly different many-body systems, based solely on their symmetries and conservation laws. Here we harness this universality, encoded in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations, to find general scaling laws for the stationary uniaxial solutions of the compressible NSF problem far from equilibrium. We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids.</p>

            <p>The unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is widely recognized as a premier model living microswimmer for physicists and biophysicists. However, the interest around C. reinhardtii goes beyond its swimming capabilities. In fact, light can drastically alter its behavior: under blue illumination, the cell attaches to a nearby surface and intermittently glides on it. Such a gliding motility is powered by molecular-motor proteins operating on the cell's cilia, and the related machinery has established the cell as a prime reference for the study of intraciliary-transport mechanisms. This is what we focus on in the present work, by combining in-line holographic microscopy -which leads to unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions on the gliding dynamics -and statistical inference. We show that, while gliding, the cells exhibit anomalous-diffusive features, including Lorentzian-like distributions of displacements, which are reminiscent of enhanced search strategies. The latter may be exploited by the cells to facilitate colony formation, or, more broadly, by organisms possessing an intraciliary-transport machinery for the transport of cargo molecules and signaling. Furthermore, gliding trajectories, by being intermittent, are valid candidates to infer forces at the molecular-motor scale that are necessary for the cells to move, or symetrically, to transport cargo molecules. We report a gliding threshold of about 20 pN, compatible with the activity of single molecular motors.</p>

            <h2>Self-assembled filament layers in drying sessile droplets: from morphology to electrical conductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Schöttner, Qingguang Xie, Gaurav Nath, Jens Harting</p>
            <p>Controlling the deposition of filaments, such as nanowires and nanotubes, from evaporating droplets is critical for the performance of emerging technologies like flexible sensors and printed electronics. The final deposit morphology strongly governs functional properties, such as electrical conductivity, yet remains challenging to control. In this work, we numerically investigate how filament length, stiffness, and concentration affect deposition patterns during the drying process. We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics.</p>

            <h2>Zipfian universality of interaction laws: A statistical-mechanics framework for inverse power scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jerome Baray</p>
            <p>Inverse power-law interaction forms, such as the inverse-square law, recur across a wide range of physical, social, and spatial systems. While traditionally derived from specific microscopic mechanisms, the ubiquity of these laws suggests a more general organizing principle. This article proposes a statistical-mechanics framework in which such interaction laws emerge as macroscopic fixed points of aggregation processes involving strongly heterogeneous microscopic contributions. We consider systems where individual interaction sources exhibit heavy-tailed heterogeneity consistent with Zipf-Pareto statistics and where aggregation proceeds without intrinsic length scales. Under minimal assumptions of heterogeneity, multiplicativity, scale invariance, and stability under coarse-graining, we show that the resulting macroscopic interaction field must adopt a scale-free, power-law form. The associated exponent is not imposed a priori but emerges from effective dimensionality, symmetry, and aggregation structure. Within this framework, the inverse-square law is interpreted as a stable statistical fixed point corresponding to isotropic aggregation in an effective three-dimensional space, while deviations from this regime naturally arise from anisotropy, constrained geometries, or nontrivial effective dimensions. This perspective provides a unified interpretation of interaction laws observed in physics, spatial economics, and human geography, without invoking domain-specific microscopic mechanisms. The proposed framework reframes inverse power-law interactions as robust emergent features of Zipfian aggregation rather than as unique consequences of particular physical forces, thereby offering a common statistical explanation for their cross-disciplinary recurrence.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model and its rich phase diagram naturally emerges as a description for a wide range of electronic systems. Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.</p>

The observed temperature and magnetic-field dependence of this hysteresis and of its relaxation time indicates the strong influence of spin-glass state on magnetoresistance. Although a quantitative theory of this effect, originating from strong electronic correlations, requires complex numerical calculations, we suggest its explanation and a simple model which qualitatively describes the observed magnetoresistance behavior and shows a strong charge-spin entanglement. The proposed effect suggests a new class of extreme magnetoresistance mechanisms.</p>

We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices.</p>

Here, we report the observation of a supersolid stripe phase in a strongly dipolar quantum gas of erbium atoms confined to 2D. We directly image the periodic density modulation, confirming its global phase coherence through matter-wave interference and demonstrating its phase rigidity relevant to the low-energy Goldstone mode, consistent with numerical calculations. Through collective excitation measurements, we demonstrate the hydrodynamic behavior of the supersolid.

Exploiting sequential crystallization of different 2D perovskites, and playing with the composition and injection events of the materials, enables the design of diverse heterostructure architectures including multiple heterojunctions.

            <p>Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer unprecedented opportunities for engineering emergent spin textures, but controlling their configuration remains a central challenge. Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations. Our results establish conformally coated woodpiles as a reconfigurable 3D ferromagnetic metamaterial platform that can be exploited for data storage, magnonics, and neuromorphic computing.</p>

            <p>We develop a unified scaling framework for the end-position distributions of tethered polymers confined in finite cylindrical geometries. Two observables are analysed: the longitudinal distribution P(x), along the confinement axis, and the transverse distribution P(y), perpendicular to the confinement axis. Using exact Fourier-sine and image-method representations with adaptive numerical schemes, we construct and test six scaling strategies for P(x) and five for P(y), encompassing geometric similarity, tether-position sweeps, confinement-strength crossovers, persistence-length effects, boundary-layer scaling near absorbing walls, and tether-centered coil scaling. Quantitative collapse diagnostics such as RMS residuals on common support, modal-energy fractions, and survival probabilities are combined with limiting-regime analysis and direct numerical evaluation to distinguish genuine universality from visually misleading overlap. From these tests we obtain a kappa-based confinement diagram and a two-parameter (kappa, a/L) regime map that link classical theories such as Flory/de Gennes blobs, Odijk deflection segments, and wormlike-chain behaviour within a single spectral picture. Gaussian, multimode, and eigenmode-dominated regimes are identified by explicit thresholds in modal composition and collapse error, providing operational criteria for when Gaussian or single-mode descriptions are valid and when full multimode structure is required. The resulting framework provides a compact, reproducible toolkit for analysing confined-polymer statistics, with applications to simulations and experiments on DNA, chromatin, and other biopolymers where confinement, stiffness, and tethering jointly control spatial organization.</p>

            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet its physical foundations and minimal underlying assumptions remain actively debated. In this work, we develop a unified framework that clarifies the origin of ETH by separating kinematic typicality from dynamical input. We show that the characteristic ETH structure of local operator matrix elements follows from four ingredients: the maximum entropy principle, the geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space, the locality of physical observables, and a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP). ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable from typical states within a narrow microcanonical shell with respect to local measurements. Within this framework, diagonal ETH emerges from measure concentration, while the universal exponential suppression and smooth energy-frequency dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements arise from entropic scaling and local dynamical correlations, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, geometry, and chaos-induced typicality, and clarify its scope, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical investigation of patterned two-dimensional semiconductors for tailored light--matter interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Nicolaisen Hansen, Line Jelver, Christos Tserkezis</p>
            <p>We introduce theoretical methods for describing the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials patterned at the nanoscale into both arrays of ribbons along a planar surface and spherical particles. Fourier-Floquet decompositions of the electromagnetic fields are used in order to obtain the reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of the nanoribbon array. The spherical particles consist of a vacuum or dielectric core, coated by single 2D material layers. A Mie theory, with boundary conditions modified to accommodate a 2D material at the interface, is applied to theoretically examine these spherical particles. As examples of 2D materials, we consider the excitonic response of hexagonal boron nitride in the ultraviolet, and of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WS2 in the visible. The most important steps and equations for implementing the various methods are provided as a means to an easy introduction to the theory of patterned 2D materials. This renders the article a toolset for investigating the patterning of any 2D material with the intention to tune their optical response and/or introduce hybridization schemes with their excitons. The methods are not restricted to exciton polaritons in 2D semiconductors, but can be applied, by simple replacement of the optical conductivity, to 2D materials exhibiting any polaritonic response.</p>

            <h2>Diffusiophoretic migration of colloidal particles in sucrose gradients</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antoine Monier, Brielle Byerley, Julien Renaudeau, H. Daniel Ou-Yang, Pierre Lidon, Jean-Baptiste Salmon</p>
            <p>Diffusiophoresis (DP) refers to the migration of particles driven by a solute concentration gradient in a liquid. Observations in the case of molecular neutral solutes are rather scarce, due to the low drift velocities in dilute solutions, and the difficulty in distinguishing DP from other phenomena in concentrated solutions. We investigated experimentally DP of dispersed colloids driven by concentration gradients of sucrose in water at relatively high concentrations, $C \simeq 1$ mol L$^{-1}$. More precisely, we designed a microfluidic chip to impose a time-dependent sucrose gradient in dead-end microchannels with minimized parasitic flows. Significant migration of the particles toward the regions of low sucrose concentration has been observed, with velocities up to a few $\mu$m s$^{-1}$. Particle tracking and Raman confocal spectroscopy were used to measure individual trajectories and the unsteady sucrose concentration profile respectively. The latter is correctly described by a diffusion equation, but with an interdiffusion coefficient that significantly depends on $C$ in the range of concentrations investigated. We then showed that a model of DP based on a steric exclusion of sucrose molecules from the particle surface with an exclusion length $R_i = 5 \pm 0.9$ angstrom (close to the characteristic size of the sucrose molecule), accounts for the observed trajectories. Possible sources for the observed scattering of our experimental data are finally discussed: Brownian motion and advection of the particles by bulk flows driven by diffusioosmosis at the channel walls and buoyancy.</p>

            <h2>Transport of Dirac magnons driven by gauge fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Fernández, Ka Shen, Leandro O. Nascimento, Van Sérgio Alves, Roberto E. Troncoso, Nicolas Vidal-Silva</p>
            <p>We present a unified quantum field theory for Dirac magnons coupled to emergent gauge fields. At zero temperature, any space- and time-dependent gauge perturbation drives magnons out of equilibrium, generating spin currents and magnon accumulation without conventional thermal or chemical potential gradients. For a honeycomb ferromagnet, we derive closed-form expressions for the induced density and current. In the DC limit, the transverse spin conductivity quantizes to $\sigma^{xy}=\alpha^2\text{sgn}(m)\hbar/4\pi$, a magnonic analog of the quantum Hall effect, where $m$ is the topological magnon mass and $\alpha$ a dimensionless coupling constant. In the AC regime, the conductivity exhibits a sharp resonance when the drive frequency matches the topological gap $\Delta$, signaling interband transitions. Our work establishes gauge fields as a versatile tool for controlling magnon transport and reveals topologically protected quantized responses.</p>

            <h2>Developing a valence force field model for wurtzite semiconductors by exploiting similarities with [111]-oriented zinc blende systems: The case of wurtzite boron nitride, III-N materials and (B,In,Ga)N alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aisling Power, Cara-Lena Nies, Stefan Schulz</p>
            <p>Controlling the crystal phase and lattice mismatch of semiconductors offers a powerful route to engineer electronic and optical properties of heterostructures. As a consequence, semiconductors in the wurtzite phase are increasingly sought after, superseding the thermodynamically favored cubic zinc blende phase. Empirical atomistic modeling, required for large scale simulations of heterostructures and their properties, relies heavily on valence force field (VFF) methods to find the equilibrium atomic positions in an alloy. For zinc blende crystals, VFF models are well-established. In the case of wurtzite, such parameters are frequently adopted without rigorous analysis, despite subtle but consequential differences from the zinc blende structure. Such an approach can compromise accuracy in describing material properties, since the structural differences between zinc blende and wurtzite directly influence electronic and optical characteristics. Based on the analytical VFF model by Tanner et al., and using structural similarities between wurtzite and [111]-oriented zinc blende, we construct a wurtzite VFF without introducing additional parameters. Our framework relies on analytic expressions and minimization routines to project zinc blende models onto wurtzite systems. Beyond elastic tensors, we train the model to reproduce bond length asymmetries and band gaps by using output of the VFF model in density functional theory calculations. Applied to wurtzite III-N compounds and BN, the model accurately reproduces targeted observables but also properties it has not been trained on, including the internal parameter u. We further validate the model on highly mismatched alloys such as (B,Ga)N and (B,In,Ga)N, exhibiting good agreement between VFF and density functional theory results when using identical supercells in these calculations.</p>

            <p>This work investigates the effect of a scandium nitride buffer layer on the superconducting properties of niobium nitride thin films. The use of a ScN buffer layer significantly improves the characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films: the critical temperature Tc increases from 9 K to 12.5 K, while the resistivity at 20 K decreases from 330 mkOhm*cm to 210 mkOhm*cm compared to films without a buffer layer. These enhancements are attributed to the better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice of the NbN film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data.</p>

            <p>Low-dimensional magnetic systems based on honeycomb lattices provide a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena that emerge from the intricate interplay of competing spin, orbital, lattice, and dipolar degrees of freedom. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the layered honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet BiCrTeO$_6$ using magnetization, specific heat, muon spin--relaxation ($\mu$SR) spectroscopy, dielectric, pyrocurrent, and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) measurements. Our results reveal an array of intriguing and strongly correlated phenomena, including two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1}\approx16$ K and $T_{\rm N2}\approx11$ K, a pronounced magnetodielectric coupling effect, and ferroelectric order at $T_{\rm N2}$. Consequently, this compound emerges as a new spin-driven multiferroic system. The SXRD analysis reveals a magnetoelastic-coupling-induced structural phase transition at $T_{\rm N2}$, characterized by a symmetry lowering from P$\bar{3}$1c (163) to P31c (159), which likely triggers the onset of ferroelectricity. In addition to its low-temperature multiferroic behavior, the system exhibits dielectric relaxor characteristics at higher temperatures within the paramagnetic region ($T<50$ K), which is intrinsically linked to the antisite disorder of Cr and Te atoms.</p>

            <h2>Probing Pair Density Waves with Twisted Josephson Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jefferson Tang, Pavel A. Volkov</p>
            <p>We show that twisted interfaces between superconductors can serve as a phase-sensitive platform for the detection and characterization of pair density waves (PDW). In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, the critical Josephson current of a twisted PDW interface is maximal at a finite field value, determined by the twist angle and the PDW period - an explicit signature of the PDW. The results are robust to variations in junction geometry and can be adapted to certain cases with strong disorder or fluctuations. Their temperature dependence allows to distinguish pure PDW from byproducts of coexistence of superconductivity and charge- or spin- density waves.</p>

            <p>Negative magnetoresistance in conventional two-dimensional electron gases is a well-known phenomenon, but its origin in complex and topological materials, especially those endowed with quantum geometry, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\boldsymbol{\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})\cdot\sigma$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $\Delta R_{zz}(\boldsymbol{\cal E},{\bf B})/R_0=-\beta_{g}(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})^2$, with $\beta_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter.</p>

            <p>We study the large-deviation properties of minimum spanning trees for two ensembles of random graphs with $N$ nodes. First, we consider complete graphs. Second, we study Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graphs with edge probability $p=c/N$ conditioned to be connected. By using large-deviation Markov chain sampling, we are able to obtain the distribution $P(W)$ of the spanning-tree weight $W$ down to probability densities as small as $10^{-300}$. For the complete graph, we confirm analytical predictions with respect to the expectation value. For both ensembles, the large deviation principle is fulfilled. For the connected ER graphs, we observe a remarkable change of the distributions at the value of $c=1$, which is the percolation threshold for the original ER ensemble.</p>

            <p>Droplets, sub-millilitre liquid volumes with at least one interface, have traditionally served as compartments for storing, transporting, and delivering materials. Beyond familiar applications in food, coatings, and consumer goods, they find cutting-edge use in energy storage, sensing, and tissue engineering. The next frontier is their integration into animate matter, emerging materials defined by their levels of activity, adaptiveness, and autonomy. Easy to produce and dispense or print into complex structures, and with enormous chemical versatility, droplets are ideal building blocks for animate matter. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for advancing animacy in droplets and call for a more concerted effort to integrate novel mechanisms for motility, sensing, and decision-making into droplet design. Although research on active droplets spans more than a century, achieving true autonomy, where droplets process multiple stimuli and respond without external control, remains a central challenge. We hope to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration towards applications in consumer goods, microfluidics, adaptive optics, tissue engineering, and soft robotics.</p>

            <p>We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.</p>

Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive. By employing the self-consistent Born approximation, we derive the analytical expressions for the magnetoresistivity of 2D massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. Notably, our result recovers the minimum conductivity in the clean limit and reveals a linear dependence of resistivity on the magnetic field for Gaussian impurity potentials, in quantitative agreement with experiments. These findings shed light on the magnetoresistance behavior of 2D Dirac fermions under ultra-high magnetic fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arnab Seth, Fay Borhani, Itamar Kimchi</p>
            <p>In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm \pi/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-\gamma}$ with $2<\gamma < 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $\gamma\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $\gamma$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.</p>

            <h2>Impact of an electron Wigner crystal on exciton propagation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Erkensten, Alexey Chernikov, Ermin Malic</p>
            <p>The strong Coulomb interaction in 2D materials facilitates the formation of tightly bound excitons and charge-ordered phases of matter. A prominent example is the formation of a crystalline phase from free charges due to mutual Coulomb repulsion, known as the Wigner crystal. While exciton- electron interactions have been used as a sensor for Wigner crystallization, its impact on exciton properties has been poorly understood so far. Here, we show that the weak potential induced by periodically ordered Wigner crystal electrons has a major impact on exciton propagation, albeit having only a minor influence on exciton energy. The effect is tunable with carrier density determining the Wigner crystal confinement and temperature via thermal occupation of higher subbands. Our work provides microscopic insights into the interplay between excitons and charge-ordered states identifying key signatures in exciton transport, and establishes a theoretical framework for understanding exciton propagation in the presence of strong electronic correlations.</p>

            <p>Materials driven far from equilibrium can encode memories of past deformations through long-lived structural reorganisations. Such memory effects-reflecting parameters such as deformation direction, magnitude, and duration have been widely explored in soft amorphous solids. Here, we report a Kovacs-like memory effect manifested as a non-monotonic stress relaxation in vitro biopolymer networks formed by collagen, an essential component of the mammalian extracellular matrix. Using shear rheology combined with in-situ optical imaging, we find that this memory effect emerges exclusively in the nonlinear strain-stiffening regime, and persists over a much broader range of strain amplitudes than previously reported for other viscoelastic amorphous materials. Furthermore, we uncover a strong correlation between the memory response and the development of negative normal stresses and associated strain fields, highlighting the unique nonequilibrium mechanics underlying memory formation in biopolymer networks.</p>

Our bosonic dimers are composed of the fermionic isotopes $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K, which is of particular interest for experiments related to pairing and superfluidity in fermionic systems with mass imbalance. We have realized dipole traps with near-infrared laser light in four different wavelength regions between 1050 and 2002 nm. We have identified trap-light-induced processes as the overall dominant source of losses, except for wavelengths around 2000 nm, where light-induced losses appeared to be much weaker. In a trap near 1550 nm, we found a plateau of minimal light-induced losses, and by carefully tuning the wavelength, we reached conditions where losses from inelastic collisions between the trapped dimers became observable. For very weakly bound dimers close to the center of a magnetically tuned Feshbach resonance, we demonstrate the Pauli suppression of collisional losses by about an order of magnitude.</p>

            <p>The insulator-quasi-metal (bad metal) transition observed in Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth, or yttrium Y) is considered a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of Hubbard's $U-t$ model. However, in reality, the insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet ($S = 1$) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless ($S = 0$) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. The effective CD-phase Hamiltonian takes into account local ($U$) and nonlocal ($V$) correlations, and the transfer of composite bosons ($t_b$). Within the framework of the effective field approximation, we have shown the existence of two types of CD phases: the high-temperature classical paramagnetic CO-phase of charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and the low-temperature magnetic quantum CDq phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, with ''uncertain valence'' [NiO$_{6}$]$^{(9\pm\delta)-}$ ($0 \le \delta \le 1$) and spin density $(1 \pm \delta)/2$ NiO$_6$-centers. In the classical CO phase, spin-triplet electron centers are surrounded by the nearest nonmagnetic hole centers, which ''turns off'' the strong superexchange interaction of the nearest neighbors. The magnetic ordering in the quantum CDq phase is determined by a strong traditional superexchange and an unusual bosonic double exchange mechanism.</p>

            <p>We present the sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study of the half-filled Hubbard model on two-dimensional quasicrystals, revealing how specific aperiodic geometries fundamentally dictate quantum criticality. By comparing the Penrose and Thue-Morse quasicrystals, we demonstrate that the nature of the magnetic phase transition is controlled by the electronic density of states (DOS): while the singular DOS of the Penrose tiling induces magnetic order at infinitesimal interaction strengths, the Thue-Morse lattice requires a finite critical interaction to drive the transition. Crucially, through a novel boundary construction strategy and rigorous finite-size scaling, we identify a quantum critical point on the Thue-Morse quasicrystal with critical exponents ($\nu \approx 0.94$, $\beta \approx 0.72$ and $z\approx 1.51$) that deviate significantly from the conventional $(2+1)$D Heisenberg $O(3)$ class. These findings establish the existence of a novel universality class driven by the interplay between electronic correlations and aperiodic geometry, challenging standard paradigms of magnetic criticality in two dimensions.</p>

            <p>Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.</p>

            <p>We report results of electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements in single crystals of EuSn$_2$As$_2$. In the temperature range of antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Eu atoms, $T \leq T_N\approx 24$\,K, the ESR signal splits into two resonance lines, one of which, at high-field (or low-frequency), is the conventional acoustic AFM resonance mode that occurs at temperatures below $T_N$. The lower-field (high-frequency) line, as we have proven here, is the ferromagnetic resonance associated with the presence in the layered AFM crystal of a small amount ($\sim 3\%$) of planar nanodefects with a non-zero ferromagnetic (FM) moment. The existence of ferromagnetic nano-inclusions in the bulk of the antiferromagnetic compound makes EuSn$_2$As$_2$ a peculiar example of a natural magnetic metamaterial. We believe that the planar FM nanodefects are also inherent in other layered AFM compounds, which explains often observed increase in their magnetic susceptibility upon cooling at $T< T_N\rightarrow 0$.</p>

            <h2>Vortex core spectroscopy links pseudogap and Lifshitz critical point in a cuprate superconductor</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tejas Parasram Singar, Ivan Maggio-Aprile, Genda Gu, Christoph Renner</p>
            <p>Understanding how superconductivity competes with other electronic phases in cuprates requires direct access to the hidden non-superconducting low temperature phase, for which Abrikosov vortices provide a unique local probe. We map the doping- and field-dependent evolution of vortex-core states in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ across a broad doping range spanning the Fermi-surface Lifshitz transition. High-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals a striking transformation of the vortex-core spectrum from unconventional, pseudogap-like signatures at moderate doping to more BCS-like behavior beyond a critical doping $p^* \approx 0.21$. This crossover aligns with the pseudogap endpoint and the onset of Fermi-surface reconstruction, indicating a direct link between pseudogap physics and vortex electronic structure. Our findings highlight the vortex core as a sensitive local probe of the cuprate ground state.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Transport in chiral Mo3Al2C Near the Superconducting to Normal Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeongsoo Park, Sang-Wook Cheong, Xianghan Xu</p>
            <p>We investigate nonreciprocal electrical transport in bulk single-crystalline Mo3Al2C, a material known to host crystallographic chirality, a polar charge-density-wave instability, and a superconducting transition near 8 K. Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We successfully synthesized a novel intermetallic compound $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ with the $\rm Fe_{13}Ge_{8}$-type crystal structure. A structural study is presented combining single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis, confirming the presence of two distinct Fe sublattices. $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ exhibits a metallic ferromagnetic state with $T_C \approx \rm 200~K$. This material does not follow the usual $M^2 \propto H/M$ Arrott law, rather a modified Arrott law is obeyed in this material. The critical exponents determined from detailed analysis of modified Arrott plots were found to be $\beta = 0.392$, $\gamma = 1.309$ and $\delta = 4.26$ obtained from the critical isotherm at $ T_{\rm C} =\rm 200~K$. Self-consistency and reliability of the critical exponent analysis were verified by the Widom scaling law and scaling equations. Using the results from renormalization group calculation, the critical behavior of $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ is akin to that of a $d=3, n=3$ ferromagnet in which the magnetic exhange distance is found to decay as $J(r) \approx r^{-4.86}$ with long-range magnetic coupling. The evaluated Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio of $\sim 3$ points to an itinerant ferromagnetic ground state. Low-temperature measurements of resistivity, $p(T)$, and specific heat, $C_P(T)$, reveal a pronounced contribution from electron-magnon scattering.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurenz Kremeyer, Bradley J. Siwick, Samuel Huberman</p>
            <p>Deviations from diffusive heat transport in high thermal conductivity crystalline insulators are generally understood within the framework of the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation. However, for low thermal conductivity materials with large primitive cells or strong anharmonicity, the recently developed Wigner Transport Equation is more appropriate as it includes tunnelling between overlapping phonon bands. In this work, via solutions to the Wigner Transport Equation, we develop a scheme to obtain the dynamics of the phonon populations and coherences as a function of an arbitrary heat source. The approach is applied to predict size effects and dynamical thermal conductivities in CsPbBr3 and La2Zr2O7 using first-principles data as input. We predict significant deviations from the bulk thermal conductivity in these materials at length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers to a few microns at room temperature, well within the reach of direct observation using current experimental techniques.</p>

            <p>In this work, we develop a rapid reactive vapor transport technique to efficiently utilize limited isotopically pure precursors, particularly gaseous 18O2, and synthesize mm-scale, high-quality crystals within few-minute growth durations. We unlock this capability by using metallic molybdenum precursors with high source temperatures (900 C) and total pressures (1 atm) to maximize precursor efficiency and yield. Subsequently, we grow MoO3 single crystals with high and uniform enrichment levels of 98Mo and 18O isotopes in several different permutations. As probed by Raman spectroscopy, modest and significant phonon energy redshifts occur following 98Mo and 18O enrichment, respectively. By demonstrating control over both molybdenum and oxygen isotopic fractions, we establish a powerful tool to advance nanophotonics and thermal management goals using MoO3. This work is motivated by the possibility to enhance and engineer lattice vibrational mode phenomena including thermal conduction and hyperbolic phonon polariton (HPhP) dispersion, with particular interest in comparing the effects of light and heavy element enrichment.</p>

            <p>Quantum geometry quantifies how the electron wavefunction evolves distinctly from conventional transport theory. In noncentrosymmetric materials, nonreciprocal transport with quantum geometric origin remains prominent with localized charge independent of vanished group velocity. The discovery of such nonreciprocal and nonlinear responses was realized by recent advances in two-dimensional materials. As a promising candidate, the electronic structure and symmetry of layered hybrid perovskites can be deliberately designed and manipulated by incorporating selected organic ligands. Despite the observation of exotic photogalvanic effects and chiral optical effects, the underlying mechanism how these nonlinear responses are enabled in the multi-quantum well structures remained unclear. Here we demonstrated the quantum geometric origin for interlayer spontaneous photocurrent in (PEA)2PbI4. Contrary to assumptions that charge transport across the 2D planes is limited, we observed a spontaneous photocurrent along this crystalline orientation. Theoretical analysis using a tight-binding model identifies shift current as the microscopic origin. This quantum geometric effect is enabled by ionic displacements from centrosymmetric coordinates and enhanced by multiband transition high-density bands of the layered hybrid crystal. We anticipate that such unique low-dimensional systems with structure can provide fertile ground for discovering novel optoelectronic functionalities.</p>

            <p>We introduce Guided Harmonic Path-Integral Diffusion (GH-PID), a linearly-solvable framework for guided Stochastic Optimal Transport (SOT) with a hard terminal distribution and soft, application-driven path costs. A low-dimensional guidance protocol shapes the trajectory ensemble while preserving analytic structure: the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations remain linear, the optimal score admits an explicit Green-function ratio, and Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) terminal laws yield closed-form expressions. This enables stable sampling and differentiable protocol learning under exact terminal matching. We develop guidance-centric diagnostics -- path cost, centerline adherence, variance flow, and drift effort -- that make GH-PID an interpretable variational ansatz for empirical SOT. Three navigation scenarios illustrated in 2D: (i) Case A: hand-crafted protocols revealing how geometry and stiffness shape lag, curvature effects, and mode evolution; (ii) Case B: single-task protocol learning, where a PWC centerline is optimized to minimize integrated cost; (iii) Case C: multi-expert fusion, in which a commander reconciles competing expert/teacher trajectories and terminal beliefs through an exact product-of-experts law and learns a consensus protocol. Across all settings, GH-PID generates geometry-aware, trust-aware trajectories that satisfy the prescribed terminal distribution while systematically reducing integrated cost.</p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific discovery, yet its use in materials research remains limited by fragmented computational ecosystems, reproducibility challenges, and dependence on commercial large language models (LLMs). Here we introduce AGAPI (this http URL API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework. AGAPI employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture that autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows spanning materials data retrieval, graph neural network property prediction, machine-learning force-field optimization, tight-binding calculations, diffraction analysis, and inverse design. We demonstrate AGAPI through end-to-end workflows, including heterostructure construction, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and semiconductor defect engineering requiring up to ten sequential operations. In addition, we evaluate AGAPI using 30+ example prompts as test cases and compare agentic predictions with and without tool access against experimental data. With more than 1,000 active users, AGAPI provides a scalable and transparent foundation for reproducible, AI-accelerated materials discovery. AGAPI-Agents codebase is available at this https URL.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaito Kobayashi, Benjamin Sappler, Frank Pollmann</p>
            <p>Isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) allow for efficient and accurate simulations of higher-dimensional quantum systems by enforcing an isometric structure. We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary "holographic" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marta Florido-Llinàs, Álvaro M. Alhambra, David Pérez-García, J. Ignacio Cirac</p>
            <p>Canonical forms are central to the analytical understanding of tensor network states, underpinning key results such as the complete classification of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases within the matrix product state (MPS) framework. Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators.</p>

            <h2>Anomalies on ALE spaces and phases of gauge theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohamed M. Anber</p>
            <p>We show that certain 't~Hooft anomalies that evade detection on commonly used closed four-dimensional manifolds become visible when a quantum field theory is placed on asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. As a concrete example, we use the Eguchi-Hanson (EH) space, whose defining features are its nontrivial second cohomology generated by the self-intersecting two-sphere and its asymptotic boundary $\mathbb{RP}^3$, which carries torsion and thus furnishes additional cohomological data absent on conventional backgrounds. For a theory with symmetry $G_1\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $\eta$-invariant associated with the $\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries.</p>

            <p>We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p>For long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$ with translation-invariant edge kernel $J$, it is a classical theorem of Aizenman and Newman (1986) that the phase transition is discontinuous when $J(x,y)$ is of order $|x-y|^{-2}$ and that there is no phase transition at all when $J(x,y)=o(|x-y|^{-2})$. We prove a strengthened version of this theorem for the hierarchical lattice, where the relevant threshold is at $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ rather than $|x-y|^{-2}$: There is a continuous phase transition for kernels of larger order, a discontinuous phase transition for kernels of exactly this order, and no phase transition at all for kernels of smaller order. As such, $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ is essentially the \emph{only} kernel that produces a discontinuous phase transition. We also prove a hierarchical analogue of the ``$M^2\beta=1$'' conjecture of Imbrie and Newman (1988), which gives an exact formula for the density of the infinite cluster at the point of discontinuous phase transition and remains open in the Euclidean setting.</p>

The HCIs are produced in a compact electron beam ion trap, then charge selected, decelerated, and finally injected into a cryogenic linear Paul trap. There, they are captured into $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Coulomb crystals, and co-crystallized within them, causing dark voids in their fluorescence images. Fine control over the number of trapped ions and HCIs allows us to realize mixed-species crystals with arbitrary ordering patterns. By investigating Xe$^{q+}$--Ca$^+$ strings, we confirm the HCI charge states, measure their lifetime and characterize the mixed-species motional modes. Our system effectively combines the established quantum control toolbox for Ca$^+$ with the rich set of atomic properties of Xe highly charged ions, providing a resourceful platform for optical frequency metrology, searches for signatures of new physics, and quantum information science.</p>

            <p>After global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher-dimensional supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology, the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables and quantum states of solitonic field histories are completely determined through a topological form of light-front quantization. We survey the logic of this construction and expand on aspects of the quantization argument. In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) dimensionally reduced to 3D, a suitable choice of flux quantization in Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis h") recovers this way the fine detail of the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) quantum observables of abelian Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall systems. An analogous choice ("Hypothesis H") of global completion of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the higher gauge sector of 11D SuGra) realizes various aspects of the topological sector of the conjectural "M-theory" and its M5-branes.</p>

            <p>Intracellular protein patterns govern essential cellular functions by dynamically redistributing proteins between membrane-bound and cytosolic states, conserving their total numbers. This review presents a theoretical framework for understanding such patterns based on mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems. The emergence, selection, and evolution of patterns are analyzed in terms of mass redistribution and interface motion, resulting in mesoscale laws of coarsening and wavelength selection. A geometric phase-space perspective provides a conceptual tool to link local reactive equilibria with global pattern dynamics through conserved mass fluxes. The Min protein system of \emph{Escherichia coli} provides a paradigmatic example, enabling direct comparison between theory and experiment. Successive model refinements capture both the robustness of pattern formation and the diversity of dynamic regimes observed \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro}. The Min system thus illustrates how to extract predictive, multiscale theory from biochemical detail, providing a foundation for understanding pattern formation in more complex and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>Practical quantum computers need to continuously exchange data between classical and quantum subsystems during a computation. Mid-circuit measurements of a qubits state are transferred to the classical electronics layer, and their outcome can inform feedforward operations that close the loop back to the quantum layer. These operations are crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computers, but the quantum-classical loop must be completed before the qubits decohere, presenting a substantial engineering challenge for full-scale systems comprising millions of qubits. Here we perform the first mid-circuit measurements in a system of silicon spin qubits, and show that feedforward operations can be performed without needing to route information to the classical layer. This in-layer approach leverages a backaction-driven control technique that has previously been considered a source of error. We benchmark our in-layer strategy, together with the standard FPGA-enabled approach, and analyse the performance of both methods using gate set tomography. Our results provide the first step towards moving resource-intensive classical processing into the quantum layer, an advance that could solve key engineering challenges, and drastically reduce the power budget of future quantum computers.</p>

We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L_\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L_\pm$.</p>

            <h2>Random matrix theory of sparse neuronal networks with heterogeneous timescales</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thiparat Chotibut, Oleg Evnin, Weerawit Horinouchi</p>
            <p>Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.</p>

            <h2>Sensitivity increase of 3D printed, self-sensing, carbon fibers structures with conductive filament matrix due to flexural loading</h2>

            <p>The excellent structural and piezoresistive properties of continuous carbon fiber make it suitable for both structural and sensing applications. This work studies the use of 3D printed, continuous carbon fiber reinforced beams as self-sensing structures. It is demonstrated how the sensitivity of these carbon fiber strain gauges can be increased irreversibly by means of a pretreatment by ``breaking-in'' the sensors with a large compressive bending load. The increase in the gauge factor is attributed to local progressive fiber failure, due to the combination of the thermal residual stress from the printing process and external loading. The coextrusion of conductive filament around the carbon fibers is demonstrated as a means of improving the reliability, noise and electrical connection of the sensors. A micrograph of the sensor cross section shows that the conductive filament contacts the various carbon fiber bundles. All-in-all, the use of ``breaking-in'' carbon fiber strain gauges in combination with coextrusion of conductive filament hold promises for 3D printed structural sensors with a high sensitivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. E. Alba-Arroyo, Daniel Pęcak, Michael McNeil Forbes, Gabriel Wlazłowski</p>
            <p>We present a unitary framework for dissipative quantum dynamics that can be efficiently applied to large-scale Fermi systems. The method introduces local Hermitian operators that emulate frictional forces while strictly preserving the unitarity of time evolution. Unlike approaches based on the Lindblad equation, our formulation scales favorably with system size and can be seamlessly integrated into time-dependent density functional theory frameworks. We demonstrate that energy dissipation arises from the damping of particle currents and pairing-field fluctuations. Furthermore, we develop a variant of the scheme that allows the particle number to vary in time, enabling controlled density scans. The method is generic and versatile, as illustrated by applications to spin-imbalanced unitary Fermi gases and to nuclear matter in the neutron-star crust. The framework can be naturally extended to include stochastic noise, providing a foundation for studying fluctuation-dissipation dynamics and thermalization in strongly interacting Fermi superfluids.</p>

            <p>Preparing ground states of strongly correlated quantum systems is a central goal in quantum simulation and optimization. The feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON) provides an attractive alternative to variational methods with a fully quantum feedback rule, but it fails in the presence of spectral degeneracies, where the feedback signal collapses and the evolution cannot reach the ground state. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>The emergence of long-range entanglement and odd-even effect in periodic generalized cluster models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhen-Yu Zheng, Shu Chen</p>
            <p>We investigate the entanglement properties in a generalized cluster model under periodic boundary condition. By evaluating the entanglement entropy and the quantum conditional mutual information entropy under three or four subsystem partitions, we identify clear signatures of long-range entanglement. Specifically, when both the system size $N$ and the interaction range $m$ are odd, the system exhibits nonzero four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropies. This non-vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy directly signals the presence of long-range entanglement. In contrast, all other combination of $N$ and $m$ yield vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy. Remarkably, in the case of $N, m \in \text{odd}$, these long-range entangled features persist even in the presence of a finite transverse field, demonstrating their robustness against quantum fluctuations. These results demonstrate how the interplay between system size and interaction range governs the emergence of long-range entanglement in one-dimensional spin systems.</p>

            <h2>Neural quantum states for entanglement depth certification from randomized Pauli measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marcin Płodzień</p>
            <p>Entanglement depth quantifies how many qubits share genuine multipartite entanglement, but certification typically relies on tailored witnesses or full tomography, both of which scale poorly with system size. We recast entanglement-depth and non-$k$-separability certification as likelihood-based model selection among neural quantum states whose architecture enforces a chosen entanglement constraint. A hierarchy of separable neural quantum states is trained on finite-shot local Pauli outcomes and compared against an unconstrained reference model trained on the same data. When all constrained models are statistically disfavored, the data certify entanglement beyond the imposed limit directly from measurement statistics, without reconstructing the density matrix. We validate the method on simulated six- and ten-qubit datasets targeting GHZ, Dicke, and Bell-pair states, and demonstrate robustness for mixed states under local noise. Finally, we discuss lightweight interpretability diagnostics derived from trained parameters that expose coarse entanglement patterns and qubit groupings directly from bitstring statistics.</p>

            <p>High-harmonic spectroscopy in solids gives insight into the inner workings of solids, such as reconstructing band structures or probing the topological phase of materials. High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly non-linear phenomena and simulations guide interpretation of experimental results. These simulations often rely on the electric dipole approximation, even though the driving fields enter regimes that challenge its accuracy. Here, we investigate effects of including nondipole terms in the light-matter coupling in simulations of HHG in materials with both topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. We show how the inclusion of nondipole terms breaks dipole selection rules, allowing for new polarizations of the generated light. Specifically we find that helicity, completely absent in the dipole approximation, is induced by the nondipole extension, and that this helicity is dependent on the topological phase of the material.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brendan Rhyno, Swarnadeep Majumder, Smitha Vishveshwara, Khadijeh Najafi</p>
            <p>Understanding how noise influences nonequilibrium quantum critical dynamics is essential for both fundamental physics and the development of practical quantum technologies. While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khalid Ferji</p>
            <p>Machine-learning (ML) models in polymer science typically treat a polymer as a single, perfectly defined molecular graph, even though real materials consist of stochastic ensembles of chains with distributed lengths. This mismatch between physical reality and digital representation limits the ability of current models to capture polymer behaviour. Here we introduce PolySet, a framework that represents a polymer as a finite, weighted ensemble of chains sampled from an assumed molar-mass distribution. This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy. By explicitly acknowledging the statistical nature of polymer matter, PolySet establishes a physically grounded foundation for future polymer machine learning, naturally extensible to copolymers, block architectures, and other complex topologies.</p>

            <p>Gibbs states play a central role in quantum statistical mechanics as the standard description of thermal equilibrium. Traditionally, their use is justified either by a heuristic, a posteriori reasoning, or by derivations based on notions of typicality or passivity. In this work, we show that Gibbs states are completely characterized by assuming dynamical stability of the system itself and of the system in weak contact with an arbitrary environment. This builds on and strengthens a result by Frigerio, Gorini, and Verri (1986), who derived Gibbs states from dynamical stability using an additional assumption that they referred to as the "zeroth law of thermodynamics", as it concerns a nested dynamical stability of a triple of systems. We prove that this zeroth law is redundant and that an environment consisting solely of harmonic oscillators is sufficient to single out Gibbs states as the only dynamically stable states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lavakumar Addepalli</p>
            <p>Multi-photon lasing has been realized in systems with strong nonlinear interactions between emitters and cavity modes, where single-photon processes are suppressed. Coherence between the internal states of a quantum emitter, or among multiple emitters, plays a key role. Such continuous nonclassical sources of light can find applications in quantum computation, quantum sensing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication. This thesis explores the multi-photon lasing phenomena in various quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity quantum electrodynamic (QED) setups. Exciton-phonon interactions are inevitable in such systems and are incorporated using the polaron-transformed master equation. The Born-Markov approximation is employed to obtain the reduced density matrix rate equation. Using quantum laser theory, we derived the Scully-Lamb laser rate equations and evaluated the single- and multi-photon excess emission rates defined as the difference between emission and absorption rates into the cavity mode without mean-field approximations. We investigated cooperative two-photon lasing, correlated emission lasing, hyperradiant lasing, non-degenerate two-mode two-photon lasing, and continuous variable entanglement in open quantum systems with single or multiple semiconductor quantum dots (two-level, three-level, and four-level) driven coherently/incoherently and coupled to single/ bimodal cavities.</p>

            <p>Pairwise exchange couplings have long been the standard mechanism for entangling spin qubits in semiconductor systems. However, implementing quantum circuits based on pairwise exchange gates often requires a lengthy sequence of elementary gate operations. In this work, we present an alternative approach: multi-qubit entangling gate operations that simultaneously drive the exchange couplings between multiple pairs of spin qubits. We explore three spin qubit systems in linear or triangular configurations. We derive analytical expressions for these multi-exchange entangling operations and demonstrate how to use the resulting three-qubit gates to construct quantum circuits capable of generating standard entangled states such as GHZ and W states, and the Toffoli gate, by optimizing control parameters. Our results show that this multi-qubit strategy significantly reduces the number of required operations, offering a pathway to more efficient, shallower, and more coherent circuits for spin-qubit processors.</p>

            <p>The management of thermal effects in plasmonic nanostructures is frequently viewed as a detrimental waste rather than a useful, controllable entity. We show that optical coupling of plasmonic nanoparticles enables precise spatiotemporal control over nanoscale heating. Through numerical investigation of experimentally-achievable systems from individual nanoparticles and dimers to nanolenses and switchable clusters, we demonstrate how plasmon hybridization and near-field coupling dictate the magnitude and spatial distribution of temperature. Our results highlight the critical role of polarization and gap distance in tuning the thermal output of dimers, the ability of a trimer nanolens to focus heat into a sub-diffraction volume, and the pronounced thermal difference in a switchable nanoparticle cluster. This work establishes a framework for designing advanced thermoplasmonic systems where heat is not merely a detriment, but a dynamically controllable element for applications in catalysis, health, or active photonic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parameshwar R. Pasnoori</p>
            <p>In this paper we consider quantum Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strengths, and following the recently formulated generalized Bethe ansatz framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], we show that constraints imposed by integrability take the same form as the renormalization group flow equations corresponding to the respective Hamiltonians with constant interaction strengths. As a concrete example, we consider the anisotropic time-dependent Kondo model characterized by the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$. We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.</p>

The rest of the FES is derived from the metadynamics trajectories that span the relevant phase space. We demonstrate our approach in the case of lead titanate. The errors across the phase transition, due to DFT numerics, all-atom molecular dynamics, and free energy evaluation by enhanced sampling, can be systematically controlled and are of the order of 1meV/atom. The accuracy of the resulting ab initio FES is only limited by the adopted functional approximation of DFT.</p>

A special setup for flow measurements under shear has been designed and optimized. Our results show that, at rest, polymer chains are globally depleted from the solid surface. Contrary to common assumptions, some polystyrene chains do adsorb onto the wall.

            <p>We theoretically investigate rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) based super-resolution microscopy in a two-level quantum dot (QD) system. The system consists of a QD interacting with two structured beams, accompanied by chirping and a time delay. The central concept of this work is inspired by the stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy technique. To understand the physical mechanism behind super-resolved spot formation, we employ a variational master equation for the density matrix, incorporating both radiative and non-radiative decay processes. A suitably chosen spatiotemporal envelope of the structured beams enables the formation of a super-resolved image. Unwanted low-intensity circular rings around the focal spot are suppressed using Bessel-modulated truncated structured Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and super-Gaussian (SG) beams. We also study the temperature dependence of the imaging scheme. The numerical results confirm that at low pulse areas, exciton-phonon coupling distorts the image, whereas at higher pulse areas, exciton-phonon decoupling preserves the image resolution. Hence, the proposed scheme may open up new possibilities for nanoscale imaging and bioimaging applications using QDs.</p>

This relation explains the distinct time scales underlying the characteristic \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure across GinUE, GUE, and crossover regimes. Additionally, we refine estimates of dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transition times for different symmetry regimes.

We show that when such ribbons are activated appropriately, the deformations produced can pull back and perform work against the externally applied load. We perform two numerical experiments to demonstrate this effect: (1) the \emph{pulling} experiment, where the ribbon is pulled longitudinally by a point force, and (2) the \emph{bending} experiment, where the ribbon is bent out of plane by a terminally applied point force. We quantify the capacity of the ribbon to work against external loads, and compute its dependence on both the ribbon thickness and the imprinted nematic texture (that is, the distribution of the nematic directors across the ribbon's length). Finally, we compute the efficiency of the activation process. Building on the outcomes of our numerical explorations, we formulate two educated conjectures on how the activation efficiency can in general be improved by acting on both the applied load and the imprinted nematic texture.</p>

            <p>The Laughlin state embodies a universal class of fractional quantum Hall effects arising in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to strong perpendicular magnetic fields. Conventionally described by a single-component wavefunction, the Laughlin state features fractionally charged quasiparticles arising from correlations within one electron species. Here, we explore a novel physical situation by introducing inter-species Coulomb coupling between two intra-species Laughlin states in a quantum Hall graphene bilayer structure. Although quasiparticle excitations typically exhibit charge gaps of tens of Kelvin, we observe that this energy scale is significantly lowered through interlayer excitonic pairing between quasiparticles and quasiholes. Identified via transport measurements, these excitons belong to an unprecedented category of charge-neutral anyons, opening a new avenue for investigating exotic quantum statistics and phases of matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> X. Wang, X. F. Wu, B. Yang, B. Zhang, B. Xiong</p>
            <p>Understanding the mechanism behind the buildup of inner correlations is crucial for studying nonequilibrium dynamics in complex, strongly interacting many-body systems. Here we investigate both analytically and numerically the buildup of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations in a dynamically tuned Ising model with various geometries, realized in a Rydberg atomic system. Through second-order Magnus expansion (ME), we demonstrate quantitative agreement with numerical simulations for diverse configurations including $2 \times n$ lattice and cyclic lattice with a star. We find that the AF correlation magnitude at fixed Manhattan distance obeys a universal superposition principle: It corresponds to the algebraic sum of contributions from all shortest paths. This superposition law remains robust against variations in path equivalence, lattice geometries, and quench protocols, establishing a new paradigm for correlation propagation in quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Current Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Diffusion-Reaction Systems via Tensor Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiayin Gu</p>
            <p>Tensor networks are employed to characterize the current fluctuations in one-dimensional diffusion-reaction systems. The representative system under study is a semiconducting material where holes and electrons constitute two types of charge carriers. These holes and electrons diffuse in the system with the reactions of pair-generation and -recombination occurring between them. The system is driven by imbalanced conditions imposed at two boundaries. The large deviation function encoding the full counting statistics of electric current is numerically calculated using the density matrix renormalization group. The fluctuation theorem is shown to hold for the current. Moreover, by comparing the cases where the reactions are turned on or off, it is revealed that the reactions have a damping effect on current fluctuations. This indicates an interesting inequality, suggesting that current fluctuations are upper bounded.</p>

            <h2>Dipole-Mode Spectrum and Hydrodynamic Crossover in a Resonantly Interacting Two-Species Fermion Mixture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhu-Xiong Ye, Alberto Canali, Chun-Kit Wong, Marian Kreyer, Emil Kirilov, Rudolf Grimm</p>
            <p>Ultracold quantum-gas mixtures of fermionic atoms with resonant control of interactions offer a unique test-bed to explore few- and many-body quantum states with unconventional properties. The emergence of such strongly correlated systems, as for instance symmetry-broken superfluids, is usually accompanied by hydrodynamic collective behavior. Thus, experimental progress in this field naturally requires a deep understanding of hydrodynamic regimes. Here, we report on experiments employing a tunable Fermi-Fermi mixture of $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K near quantum degeneracy. We investigate the full spectrum of dipole modes across a Feshbach resonance and characterize the crossover from collisionless to deep hydrodynamic behavior in measurements of frequencies and damping rates. We compare our results with a theoretical model that considers the motion of the mass centers of the two species and we identify the contributions of friction and mean-field interaction. We show that one oscillating mode exists over the whole range of interactions, exhibiting striking changes of frequency and damping in the deep hydrodynamic regime. We observe the second oscillating mode to split into two purely exponential damping modes. One of these exponential modes shows very fast damping, faster than any other relevant timescale, and is largely insensitive against experimental imperfections. It provides an accurate measure for the interspecies drag effect, which generalizes the concept of spin drag explored in other experiments. We characterize the interspecies drag locally in terms of a microscopic friction coefficient and we discuss its unitarity-limited universal behavior on top of the resonance.</p>

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Spontaneous symmetry breaking provides a powerful window into the nature of underlying electronic orders. In strongly correlated systems, multiple symmetry-breaking orders can arise simultaneously. and their interplay generates an intricate landscape of quantum phases that has remained a central focus of condensed-matter research. In this work, we report a previously unidentified electronic phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, distinguished by the simultaneous breaking of rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetries. Broken rotational symmetry is evidenced through anisotropic transport in angle-resolved measurements, while the onset of both the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect signals the breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. These combined signatures reveal an emergent order consistent with momentum-space condensation, a theoretically anticipated phenomenon realized here experimentally for the first time. This mechanism establishes a natural framework for understanding a broader class of correlated phases known to emerge from the flat bands of two-dimensional materials.</p>

Our analysis reveals that the bounds differ for particle and heat currents and are dependent on the system parameters.

            <p>We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$. We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.</p>

            <p>Thin film effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy (MAE) of MnN were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Initially, strain effects on bulk MnN were considered as a proxy for lattice-matching induced strain and a linear relationship between the $c/a$ ratio and the MAE was found. A fundamental explanation for this relationship in terms of the underlying point-group symmetry is given, which we show is applicable to all uniaxial magnetic materials. Strain and charge-transfer effects were then considered for an ultra-thin film. It was found that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions, leading to a reduction of the MAE. Charge transfer is shown to be the cause of this, and hence similar effects may be expected at any magnetic heterostructure interface.</p>

            <p>Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to topological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great interest across diverse research fields. Realizing skin effects typically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we theoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, reciprocal dissipative couplings can nontrivially give rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, hosting pseudospin degree of freedom and featuring helical transport, dubbed as the ``helical pseudospin skin effect". Before introducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized pseudospin edge modes and extended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is applied from $0$ to $\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct pseudospin skin effects and their topological transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical pseudospin skin effects. Our findings not only highlight gauge field enriched non-Hermitian topology, but also brings pseudospin-momentum locking into skin effects.</p>

            <h2>Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingsheng Tian, Rhine Samajdar, Bryce Gadway</p>
            <p>Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.</p>

            <h2>Van-Hove singularities and competing instabilities in an altermagnetic metal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Rao, Johannes Knolle, Laura Classen</p>
            <p>Van-Hove (VH) singularities in the single-particle band spectrum are important for interaction-driven quantum phases. Whereas VH points are usually spin-degenerate, in newly proposed altermagnets VH singularities can become spin-dependent, due to momentum-dependent spin polarization of the Fermi surfaces arising from combined rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We consider two altermagnetic models ($d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave) on a square lattice with spin-polarized VH points, and study their stable fixed-point solutions indicating interaction-induced instabilities using parquet renormalization group. For both models, we find new stable fixed-point solutions of the renormalization group equations which are not connected to the solution in the spin-degenerate limit. This implies that on the square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect to altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave model, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large altermagnetic splitting. At small altermagnetic splitting both imaginary charge density wave and real longitudinal spin density waves are dominant.</p>

            <p>By sidestepping the intractable calculations of many-body wavefunctions, density functional theory (DFT) has revolutionized the prediction of ground states of materials. However, predicting nonlinear responses--critical for next-generation quantum devices--still relies heavily on explicit wavefunctions, limiting computational efficiency. In this letter, using the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals as a representative example, we realize a 1000-fold computational speedup by eliminating the explicit dependence on wavefunctions. Our approach leverages the one-to-one correspondence between free parameters of Weyl fermions and the associated responses to obtain precise wavefunction-free formulations. Applying our methodology, we systematically investigated known Weyl semimetals and revealed that Ta$_3$S$_2$ exhibits photocurrents an order of magnitude greater than those observed in TaAs, with potential for an additional order-of-magnitude enhancement under strain. To further demonstrate the generality of our approach, we obtained a wavefunction-free formula for the Berry-curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals. Our work paves the way for substantially more efficient screening and optimization of nonlinear electromagnetic properties in topological quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Extrinsic contribution to bosonic thermal Hall transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Léo Mangeolle, Johannes Knolle</p>
            <p>Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.</p>

            <p>Frustrated magnets provide a platform for exploring exotic phases beyond conventional ordering, with potential relevance to functional materials and information technologies. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to map the thermodynamic phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R = Dy, Ho) with three stable magnetic ground-state stable phases: frustrated spin-ice 2 in 2 out (2I2O) phase, frustrated fragmented 3 in 1 out/1 in 3 out (3I1O/1I3O) phase, and antiferromagnetic all in all out (AIAO) phase without frustration. We discovered two additional emergent metastable phases at finite temperatures, located between the boundaries separating those stable phases. These metastable phases exhibit high magnetic susceptibility and high entropy without long-range order. Their stabilization arises from entropic minimization of the free energy, where the entropy dominates energetic competition near phase boundaries at finite temperatures. Our results demonstrate a platform to engineer highly susceptible and degenerated states through frustration and thermal activation, offering a foundation for entropy-based design of metastable phases in correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.</p>

In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.</p>

            <p>Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Al or Eu and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, leading to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu and Al adlayers leads to the formation of superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$ in nominal Eu/BaBiO$_3$ and Al/BaBiO$_3$ bilayers. Anisotropic magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage signatures of quasi two-dimensional superconductivity are observed. The mechanisms behind quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity and the role of disorder remain to be clarified. These findings highlight the potential for the use of in situ reduction of bismuthate heterostructures as a platform for stabilizing materials with exotic functional properties. Additionally, the strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</p>

After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which reveals the role played by vacuum fluctuations in seeding the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features. These point towards future experimental probes of the late-time nonlinear regime where further analogies can be drawn with reheating, i.e. the thermalization of the post-inflationary Universe.</p>

            <p>Based on the study of a one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a comb lattice, this work identifies an example of spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking in a 1D system with short-range interactions. When a symmetry-preserving relevant perturbation is applied to the system, we find that this model can always be described by the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem. The Shen-Qiu-Tian theorem establishes a direct connection between the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem (in the case of bipartite lattices with unequal numbers of sites in the two sublattices) and the breaking of continuous symmetry. Moreover, although previous studies have suggested that the presence of a tower of states (TOS) serves as an important numerical diagnostic of a system's tendency toward spontaneous symmetry breaking, these investigations have primarily focused on 2D systems. In 1D systems, however, the presence of long-range order does not automatically imply the emergence of a TOS. Here, we observe the existence of a TOS in a 1D realistic ferrimagnetic lattice system with short-range interactions.</p>

            <p>Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for understanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes such as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are well established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy is funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex molecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is partially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria. Specifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific vibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we introduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed theory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a state-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific spectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by low-frequency modes ($<$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance with the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the most important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\sim$200 cm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned intramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($>$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no role in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow energy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the energy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value, these insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices and, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control tasks.</p>

            <p>Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.</p>

            <h2>Cluster-diagrammatic D-TRILEX approach to non-local electronic correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Félix Fossati, Evgeny A. Stepanov</p>
            <p>In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX", developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.</p>

            <h2>Band Meandering due to Charged Impurity Effects and Carrier Transport in Ternary Topological Insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kanav Sharma, Niranjay K R, Infan S Mesh, Radha Krishna Gopal, Chiranjib Mitra</p>
            <p>Controlling charged impurity disorder is a critical challenge for realizing the promise of topological insulator (TI) surfaces in devices. While doping is often used to tune the chemical potential, its impact on the fundamental disorder landscape remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate this effect in ternary (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST) thin films and their indium-doped (IBST) counterparts. Gate-dependent transport reveals that indium doping increases charged impurity density by an order of magnitude, which in turn reduces the characteristic size of disorder-induced charge puddles from $\sim$91 nm to $\sim$38 nm. This amplified disorder enhances Coulomb scattering and suppresses field-effect mobility, directly demonstrating how doping-induced compensation degrades surface transport. Our work establishes doping as a powerful method to probe the limits of topological protection and underscores that defect suppression, not just compensation, is essential for developing high-performance TI devices.</p>

            <h2>Description using equilibrium temperature in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics employing the conventional expectation value</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masamichi Ishihara</p>
            <p>We studied the thermodynamic quantities and the probability distribution, expressing the probability distribution as a function of the energy, in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics, which is characterized by the entropic parameter $q$, employing the conventional expectation value (the linear average). We treated the power-law-like distribution. The equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, was employed, and the probability distribution described with the equilibrium temperature was derived. The Tsallis statistics represented by the equilibrium temperature was applied to $N$ harmonic oscillators, where $N$ is the number of the oscillators. The expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity were obtained. The expressions of these quantities and the expression of the probability distribution were obtained when the differences between adjacent energy levels are the same. These quantities and the distributions were numerically calculated. The $q$ dependences of the energy, the Rényi entropy, and the heat capacity are weak. In contrast, the Tsallis entropy depends on $q$. The probability distribution as a function of the energy depends on $N$ and $q$. The results provide a basis for describing power-law-like phenomena in the Tsallis statistics. The present formulation is expected to apply to various phenomena, because the harmonic oscillator plays a fundamental role in describing classical and quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shixiang Chen, Hongguang Liang, Juan Wang, Yan Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using in-phase and out-of-phase protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, out-of-phase modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas in-phase modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes. Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.</p>

            <h2>Solute segregation-induced activation of grain boundary disconnections</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zuoyong Zhang, Chuang Deng</p>
            <p>Disconnections, long recognized as the key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystalline materials, have traditionally been understood to nucleate through thermal or mechanical activation. In this work, using atomistic simulations, we reveal a distinct nucleation mechanism driven exclusively by solute interstitial segregation across multiple substitutional binary alloy systems (e.g., Al-Ni, Al-Fe). This process exhibits a zero-nucleation energy barrier, contrasting sharply with the nucleation mechanisms in pure systems. We identify two segregation-induced disconnection types: (i) annihilable disconnections that promote GB migration and annihilate with continuous segregation, and (ii) permanent disconnections that form stable dipoles, which are mechanically robust, suppressing shear-coupled migration and instead resulting in GB amorphization and pure sliding under applied shear loading. The long-range stress fields associated with these permanent disconnections further attract solute atoms and assist the nucleation of precipitates. These solute segregation-activated disconnections, absent in pure materials, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed through dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across different alloy chemistries and crystal structures. Our findings demonstrate that solute interstitial segregation provides a powerful and previously unrecognized pathway for barrier-free disconnection formation, thereby fundamentally extending current understanding of GB kinetics in alloy systems.</p>

            <p>Water contained within biological membranes plays a critical role in maintaining the separation between intracellular and extracellular environments and facilitating biochemical processes. Variations in membrane composition and temperature lead to phase state changes in lipid membranes, which in turn influence the structure and dynamics of the associated interfacial water. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on binary membranes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM) mixed with cholesterol (Chol). To elucidate the effects of Chol on interfacial water, we examined the orientation and hydrogen-bonding behavior of water molecules spanning from the membrane interior to the interface. As the Chol concentration increased, a transient slow down in water dynamics was observed in the ripple phase at 303 K. Conversely, at higher Chol concentrations, water dynamics were accelerated relative to pure lipid membranes across all temperatures studied. Specifically, at a Chol concentration of 50%, the hydrogen bond lifetime in DPPC membranes decreased to approximately 0.5-0.7 times that of pure lipid membranes. This nonmonotonic behavior is attributed to the combined effects of membrane packing induced by Chol and a reduced density of lipid molecules in the hydrophilic region, offering key insights for modulating the dynamical properties of interfacial water.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomasz Zawiślak, Sandro Stringari, Alessio Recati</p>
            <p>We show that two-component Bose-Einstein condensed mixtures, in presence of a persistent current, exhibit a non trivial Doppler shift of the sound velocities. The peculiarity is due to the inter-species interaction and the possibility of generating a counter-flow persistent current. Analytic predictions are derived by using superfluid hydrodynamics. While the existence of anomalous Doppler shifts at finite temperature has been discussed a long time ago in the case of superfluid Helium-4, an experimental verification of the effect is still missing. For this reason, we also propose a protocol for the measurement of the Doppler shifts, based on the density-density response function. The dynamical protocol is simulated by means of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations.</p>

            <h2>Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Zhang, Wen-Tao Xu</p>
            <p>Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.</p>

            <p>Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through superoscillations. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.</p>

            <p>We study the fractal properties of depth-first search (DFS) paths in critical configurations of statistical physics models, including the two-dimensional $O(n)$ loop model for various $n$, and bond percolation in dimensions $d = 2$ to $6$. In the $O(n)$ loop model, across both critical and tricritical Potts regimes, the fractal dimension of the DFS path consistently follows $d_{\rm DFS} = 1 + g/8$, where $g$ is the coupling constant in Coulomb gas theory, related to $n$ via $n^2 = 2 + 2 \cos(\pi g/2)$ with $g \in [8/3, 16/3]$. For bond percolation, the DFS path exhibits nontrivial fractal scaling across all studied dimensions. Interestingly, when DFS is applied to the full lattice without any dilution or criticality, the path is still fractal in two dimensions, with a dimension close to $7/4$, but becomes space-filling in higher dimensions. Our results demonstrate that DFS offers a robust and broadly applicable geometric probe for exploring critical phenomena beyond traditional observables.</p>

            <p>The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The relaxation time was found to depend on the strength of anisotropy.</p>

            <h2>Universal properties and dynamical bosonization of strongly interacting one-dimensional anyons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ovidiu I. Patu</p>
            <p>We study a one-dimensional system of strongly interacting anyons with short-range interactions under external confinement. This system, referred to as $p$-wave anyons, interpolates continuously between spin-polarized fermions with $p$-wave interactions and free bosons. At zero temperature, the correlation functions decay exponentially with distance, with oscillations governed by the statistics parameter. The decay rate is maximal for $p$-wave fermions and decreases monotonically as the statistics parameter approaches the bosonic limit, where it vanishes. The momentum distribution is asymmetric, a hallmark of one-dimensional anyons, and takes the form of a shifted Lorentzian with universal power-law tails, $\lim_{k \to \pm \infty} n(k)\sim C/k^2$. We prove analytically that, following release from a harmonic trap, the asymptotic momentum distribution converges to that of free bosons in the same trap, a phenomenon known as dynamical bosonization. We also establish the universality of the groundstate $n$-particle reduced density matrices: their natural occupations are independent of the confining potential, while the associated natural $n$-functions for different confinements are related through a simple analytical transformation. In particular, for the one-particle reduced density matrix, we derive exact expressions for both the natural occupations and the natural orbitals at arbitrary particle number. These results extend and unify earlier partial findings for $p$-wave fermions, and they provide a clear conceptual explanation of the double degeneracy observed in their spectrum.</p>

            <p>Spin-orbit entangled excitons (SOEE) in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets provide direct access to explore unconventional many body interactions in correlated electron systems. In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronounced temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel (TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T < TED to ~ 3 ps at T > TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.</p>

            <p>We study the impact of weak quenched disorder on the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model within a functional-integral approach. By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly-interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled approach for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.</p>

            <p>Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.</p>

            <p>The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.</p>

In contrast to the standard BG model, we suppose here that the time-evolution of the position components is driven not by Gaussian white-noises, but by two statistically-independent dichotomous noises. We calculate analytically the position variances and cross-correlations, as well as the mean angular momentum, which permits us to establish the conditions in which a spontaneous rotational motion of the particle around the origin takes place. We also present a numerical analysis of the mean angular velocity. Lastly, we calculate analytically some marginal position probability density functions revealing a remarkably rich behavior that emerges in such a system of two coupled linear stochastic differential equations. We show that depending on the values of parameters characterizing noises these distributions approach the steady-state forms defined on a finite support, having very unusual shapes, possessing multiple maxima and minima, plateaus and exhibiting a discontinuous behavior.</p>

While the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Using diffusion-based generative structure prediction and machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we investigate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key mixed-anion decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and demonstrate that the amorphous counterpart is conductive, with projected room-temperature $\sigma \approx 0.18$ mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\mathrm{a} \approx 0.40$ eV. This enhancement stems from structural disorder flattening the Li site-energy landscape and a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers.

            <p>Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.</p>

            <p>To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes, we investigate a benzoxazolium--coumarin (BCO+) donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) agrees well with these features and enables assignment of specific intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify the characteristic low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to intramolecular charge transfer-relevant nuclear motions, highlighting that THz-TDS can serve as a sensitive probe of vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya</p>
            <p>Using the mean-field approximation, a formula for the effective electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional system of randomly arranged conducting sticks with a given orientation distribution was obtained. Both the resistance of the sticks themselves and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The accuracy in the resulting formula was analyzed. A comparison of the theoretical predictions of mean-field approach with the results of direct electrical conductivity calculations for several model orientation distributions describing systems with crossed sticks demonstrated good agreement. Our study showed that cross-alignment of nanowires should lead to a decreasing in the electrical conductivity compared to electrodes with isotropically arranged nanowires. We suppose that the widely used model with zero-width sticks is quite acceptable for systems of cross-aligned nanowires, but overestimates their connectivity in isotropic systems. Thus, the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of conducting films with cross-aligned nanowires may be due to a significant difference in the network topology.</p>

            <h2>Discontinuous transition in explosive percolation via local suppression</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Young Sul Cho</p>
            <p>We study an explosive percolation model in which a link is randomly added and neighboring nodes sequentially rewire their links to suppress the growth of large clusters. In this manner, the rewiring nodes spread outward starting from the initial node closest to the added link. We show that a discontinuous transition emerges even when the total number of rewiring nodes after each link addition is finite. This finding implies that adding a link using the information of the cluster sizes attached to a finite set of link candidates (local information) can lead to a discontinuous transition if link rewiring is allowed. This result thus extends the previous result that a discontinuous transition arises only when a link is added using the information of the cluster sizes attached to an infinite number of link candidates (global information) in the absence of rewiring.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Karna, Hansen S. Wu, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Ribhu K. Kaul</p>
            <p>Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>Ultrafast electron and phonon dynamics at a buried interface of GaP/Si(001) are investigated at different growth stages of the GaP layer by combining interface-specific photoexcitation and transient reflectivity detection. A discrete electronic state, which dominates the charge carrier dynamics at the interface of a thin low-temperature nucleation layer, is found to be quenched by the following high-temperature overgrowth. A coherent phonon mode localized at the heterointerface is observed for both the thin nucleation layers and the thicker overgrown layers, and their amplitude exhibits the similar resonance behavior to that of the interface electronic transition at the respective growth stages. The optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude is nearly isotropic for the nucleation layer but becomes anisotropic after the overgrowth, possibly due to the formation of an intermixing layer. Our observations imply that the 2-THz phonon mode itself is robust against the high-temperature overgrowth, but its amplitude is defined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition that is more sensitively affected by the overgrowth.</p>

            <p>We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</p>

            <h2>High-Precision Simulations of the Parity Conserving Directed Percolation Universality Class in 1+1 Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Grassberger</p>
            <p>Next to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, parity conserving directed percolation (pcDP; also called parity conserving branching annihilating random walks, pcBARW) is the second-most important model with an absorbing state transition. Its distinction from ordinary DP is that particle number is conserved modulo 2, which implies that there are two distinct sectors in systems with a finite initial number of particles: Realizations with even and odd particle numbers show different scaling behaviors, and systems in the odd sector cannot die. An intriguing feature of pcDP it is that some of its critical exponents seem to be very simple rational numbers. The most prominent is the one describing the average number of particles (or active sites) in the even sector, which is asymptotically constant. In contrast, the dynamical critical exponent (which is the same in both sectors) seems not close to any simple rational. Finally, the order parameter exponent $\beta$ (which is also the same in both sectors) is, according to the most precise previous simulations, rather close to 1, but incompatible with it. We present high statistics simulations which clarify this situation, and which indicate several other intriguing properties of pcPD clusters. In particular, we find that all exponents which were close to rationals are even closer, and $\beta = 1.000$ with the error in the next digit.</p>

            <h2>Transverse response from anisotropic Fermi surfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhiram Soori</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic bandstructures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting transverse voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the transverse response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer transverse signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.</p>

            <h2>Quenching dynamics of vortex in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan Wang, Zhenze Fan, Yan Li</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground states and rich dynamics of vortices in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) subject to position-dependent detuning. Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.</p>

            <h2>A Unified Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders via Spin Space Groups: Prediction of Coplanar Even-Wave Phases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ziyin Song, Ziyue Qi, Chen Fang, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng</p>
            <p>Spin space groups (SSGs) impose fundamentally different constraints on magnetic configurations in real and reciprocal spaces. As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders.</p>

            <p>We propose a coupled nonlinear cavity-magnon system, consisting of two cavities, a second-order nonlinear element, and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere that supports Kerr magnons, to realize the sought-after highly tunable nonreciprocity. We first derive the critical condition for switching between reciprocity and nonreciprocity in the absence of magnon driving, and then numerically demonstrate that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can be achieved by violating this critical condition. When magnons are driven, we show that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can also be attained even within the critical condition. Compared to previous studies, the introduced nonlinear element not only relaxes the critical condition in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, but also offers an alternative means to tune magnonic nonreciprocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing highly tunable nonreciprocal devices based on Kerr magnons.</p>

            <h2>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yuan Chen</p>
            <p>A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has long been desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, solved by higher category theory. The problem is solved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way. The refinement needed is a generalization--through the lens of higher category theory--of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, making the language of categories natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ pion vacua non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory; the structures behind the non-linear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory are related via an implicit Yang-Baxter equation. In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</p>

            <p>Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</p>

            <h2>Strict universality of the square-root law in price impact across stocks: a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa</p>
            <p>Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models (Nature 2003, QJE 2006, and Quant. Finance 2013). Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</p>

            <p>Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and, via a statistical quasinormal mode analysis, interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation in semicontinuous metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include colour shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies, for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.</p>

Here, we show that similar bipartite entanglement properties can be realized on a square lattice with anisotropic interactions in four different quadrants. The interaction to generate such entanglement is much simpler than the previous constructions by coupling orthogonal arrays of highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with different scalings of entanglement entropy at the critical point and in the lowly entangled phase, and faster decay of the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase. The tensor network representation of the new ground state consists of tensors with lower rank, while preserving a global geometry similar to that of the original networks.</p>

            <p>We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ansätze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansätze.</p>

            <p>We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.</p>

            <p>A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.</p>

            <p>This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. During operation, these materials undergo cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, resulting in complex degradation mechanisms that traditional empirical or purely data-driven models often fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model is more robust than traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. Model interpretability assessed via SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed that strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and test temperature are the dominant features, each exhibiting a physically consistent inverse correlation with fatigue life. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that strain amplitude is the primary driver of fatigue degradation in both alloy classes, while irradiation dose and temperature introduce alloy-specific sensitivities. The PINN successfully captured key mechanistic trends, including the comparatively stable irradiation response and dose saturation behaviour of F/M steels, as well as a pronounced reduction in fatigue life at elevated temperatures exceeding the tempering threshold. Overall, the proposed PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable tool for predicting fatigue life in irradiated structural alloys, thereby supporting informed materials selection and performance assessment for advanced nuclear reactor applications.</p>

            <p>Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.</p>

            <h2>Conformal 3-point correlators in momentum space, method of subgraphs and the $1/N$ expansion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhijin Li</p>
            <p>Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to a few parameters, which are known only at leading order in perturbative expansions. The major challenges come from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and that it is closely related to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of conserved current 3-point correlators using exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep only the first few terms in the subgraph expansions to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative results with the bootstrap data and discuss their application to conductivity near the quantum critical point.</p>

            <h2>How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Lenzner, Jörn Bonse</p>
            <p>In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.</p>

            <h2>A self-organized compression network arrests epithelial proliferation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liav Daraf, Yael Lavi, Areej Saleem, Daniel Sevilla Sanchez, Yuri Feldman, Lior Atia</p>
            <p>As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. As a confluent epithelial layer becomes progressively more jammed, two interpenetrating networks emerge: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells percolating within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of the compression network was found to be susceptible to both specific molecular stimulus and to injury-induced unjamming. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that was well-captured by preferential network theory. Together, these findings demonstrate the existence of a network-based inhibition of proliferation (NIP) that is self-organizing and poised in proximity to criticality.</p>

            <h2>Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefan Nolte, Jörn Bonse, Nadezhda M. Bulgakova</p>
            <p>Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.</p>

            <h2>Strong coupling of collective optical resonances in dielectric metasurfaces</h2>

            <p>Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarised excitation, and the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarised illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. The first effect is accompanied by hybridized near fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarisation, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.</p>

            <h2>Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izzatjon Allayarov, Andrey B. Evlyukhin, Antonio Calà Lesina</p>
            <p>Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</p>

            <h2>Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu, Po-Shen Hsin</p>
            <p>A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-König bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-König bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions surpassing the Bravyi-König bound for achieving the logical gates in the $(n+1)$-th level of Clifford hierarchy in $n$ spatial dimension.</p>

            <h2>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhanna Kuznetsova, Francesco Toppan</p>
            <p>We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bo Xing, Giuliano Chiriacò, Paola Cappellaro, Rosario Fazio, Dario Poletti</p>
            <p>The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian (NH) systems have attracted great attention due to their exotic phenomena beyond Hermitian domains. Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge.</p>

            <h2>Andreev spin qubits bound to Josephson vortices in spin-orbit coupled planar Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katharina Laubscher, Valla Fatemi, Jay D. Sau</p>
            <p>We propose a variant of Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) defined in planar Josephson junctions based on spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a weak out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D.A. Rodionov, S.G. Timchenko, I.V. Zagorodnev</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate a nonlinear response to a linearly polarized monochromatic electromagnetic wave incident at an angle on a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system (ES) in the form of an infinite strip. The 2D ES is situated on a dielectric substrate near a perfectly conducting metal electrode (gate). The entire system is subjected to an external perpendicular constant magnetic field. We use Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves, while the electrons are described within the hydrodynamic approximation using Euler's equations and neglecting electromagnetic retardation effects. The incident electromagnetic wave excites magnetoplasmons in the strip. The fully screened limit is considered when all characteristic dimensions of the system, including the plasmon wavelengths, are much larger than the distance to the gate. This limit allows the linear response to be determined fully analytically. Due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic (convective) term, the excited magnetoplasmon oscillations give rise to a DC current along the strip and a voltage across it. Surprisingly, the relationship between the photocurrent and the photovoltage in resonance is exactly the same as in the classical Hall effect. The photovoltage is a monotonic function of the magnetic field. However, the photocurrent exhibits a minimum, which occurs at specific wavevector directions.</p>

            <p>The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows an unconventional interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Tuning the band filling is known to rapidly suppress long-range CDW order and drive the formation of two superconducting ``domes" upon increasing hole concentration. Here we determine the detailed evolution of charge correlations across this phase diagram and resolve their interplay with the superconducting state. Upon light hole-doping, the suppression of a metastable $2\times 2\times 4$ CDW state coincides with the suppression of superconducting fluctuations present in the parent CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ compound. Continued doping suppresses long-range $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW order, leaving remnant short-range, quasi-1D correlations that persist across the second superconducting dome. These higher temperature charge correlations are seemingly essential to the lower temperature superconducting state, as charge correlations vanish coincident with superconductivity as a function of hole-doping. A multidomain model of short-range V-V dimer formation within the kagome plane is proposed in the second superconducting dome, where rotational and translational symmetry remain locally broken even in the absence of long-range CDW order.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit a wide range of electronic properties that make them promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronic devices. Accurate prediction of their quantum transport behavior is therefore of both fundamental and technological importance. While density functional theory (DFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green$'$s function (NEGF) formalism provides reliable insights, its high computational cost limits applications to large-scale or high-throughput studies. Here we present DeePTB-NEGF, a framework that combines a deep learning-based tight-binding Hamiltonians derived learned directly from first-principles calculations (DeePTB) with efficient quantum transport simulations implemented in the DPNEGF package. To validate the method, we apply it to three prototypical 2D materials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MoS$_2$. The resulting band structures and transmission spectra show excellent agreement with conventional DFT-NEGF results, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. These results highlight the capability of DeePTB-NEGF to enable accurate and efficient quantum transport simulations, thereby opening avenues for large-scale exploration and device design in 2D materials.</p>

            <p>In quantum materials with multiple degrees of freedom with similar energy scales, intertwined electronic orders with distinct broken symmetries often appear in a strongly coupled fashion. Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.</p>

            <p>A series of Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 samples, CaK(Fe1-xMnx)4As4 with x values of 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05, are synthesized using two distinct routes: conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas-pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. Comprehensive characterizations are performed on these samples to investigate their superconducting properties. This study examines the effects of Mn substitution at Fe sites in the FeAs layer on the superconducting properties of the CaKFe4As4 (1144) material. The HP-HTS process improves the microstructure and phase purity of the parent sample (x = 0), resulting in an enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tc). In contrast, Mn doping via the CSP method in CaKFe4As4 reduces the sample quality and superconducting performance. Notably, the high-pressure synthesis method leads to an increase in the Tc by 3 to 7 K, particularly at low Mn concentrations. While the critical current density (Jc) of the parent sample (x = 0) shows a significant enhancement under the applied magnetic fields, Jc decreases for Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 bulks. These results demonstrate that high-pressure synthesis is an effective approach to improve the superconducting properties of Mn-doped 1144 compounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Althüser, Ilya M. Eremin, Götz S. Uhrig</p>
            <p>For the BCS theory of superconductivity, the electron-phonon interaction is transformed to an attractive electron-electron interaction in the vicinity of the Fermi energy only. At the same time, its formal derivation using a unitary transformation reveals that the electrons attract one another whenever their energies do not differ more than the phonon energy $\omega_\mathrm{D}$, independent of closeness to the Fermi energy. Consequently, the order parameter becomes finite even away from the Fermi level. Yet, for small interactions, its magnitude is usually small and can be safely ignored, justifying the BCS approximation. Intriguingly, we find that an accumulation of density-of-states at an energy $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$ in proximity to the Fermi energy induces a significant order parameter magnitude around $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$, which exceeds the one at $E_\mathrm{F}$ for moderate coupling strengths. This strong enhancement is heralded by the softening of an additional collective mode, which resembles a second phase transition. We predict measurable signatures in the thermodynamic and spectroscopic response of this unexpected phenomenon, guiding future experimental searches for it.</p>

            <p>It is known that cuprate artificial high temperature superlattices (AHTS) with period d, composed of quantum wells confining interface space charge in stoichiometric Mott insulator layers (S), with thickness L, at the interface with overdoped normal metallic cuprate layers (N) show a superconducting dome by tuning the geometric L over d ratio of the SNSN superlattice with the top predicted by quantum material design engineering quantum size effects. Here we report high-field magneto transport measurements up to 41 Tesla of AHTS across the entire superconducting dome. The results show the universal upward-concave behavior of the temperature dependent upper critical magnetic field in low critical temperature samples at rising edge and drop edge of the dome providing compelling evidence for two-band superconductivity in agreement with multigap theory used for quantum design of the SNSN superlattices. The measured superconducting coherence length demonstrates that atomic-scale engineering controls not only the critical temperature but also the intrinsic pair size at Fano-Feshbach resonances physics paving the way toward next generation quantum devices and shedding light on unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Self-consistent effective field theory to nonuniversal Lee-Huang-Yang term in quantum droplets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi Zhang, Xiaoran Ye, Ziheng Zhou, Zhaoxin Liang</p>
            <p>Quantum droplets (QDs) in weakly interacting ultracold quantum gases are typically characterized by mean-field theories incorporating Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) quantum fluctuations under simplified zero-range interaction assumptions. However, bridging these models to broader physical regimes like superfluid helium requires precise understanding of short-range interatomic interactions. Here, we investigate how finite-range interactions--next-order corrections to zero-range potentials--significantly alter QDs mechanics. Using a consistent effective theory, we derive an analytical equation of state (EOS) for three-dimensional bosonic mixtures under finite-range interactions at zero temperature. Leveraging the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, we demonstrate that interspecies attraction facilitates bosonic pairing across components characterized by the non-perturbative parameter of $\Delta$, leading to nonuniversal LHY terms that encode short-range interaction details while recovering previous universal QDs EOS in the zero-range limit. Extending superfluid hydrodynamic equations for two-component systems, we predict fractional frequency shifts in breathing modes induced by these nonuniversal terms. Experimental observation of these shifts would reveal critical insights into QDs dynamics and interatomic potential characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Valley-dependent electronic properties in two-dimensional altermagnetic iron-based transition metal chalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> An-Dong Fan, Yong-Kun Wang, Jin-Yang Li, Si Li</p>
            <p>Altermagnets represent a newly identified third class of collinear magnets and have recently emerged as a focal point in condensed matter physics. In this work, through first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we identify monolayer Fe$_2$MoX$_4$ (X = S, Se, Te) and Fe$_2$WTe$_4$, a class of iron-based transition metal chalcogenides, as promising altermagnetic materials. These systems are found to be semiconductors exhibiting spin splitting in their nonrelativistic band structures, indicative of intrinsic altermagnetic ordering. Remarkably, their valence bands feature a pair of valleys at the time-reversal-invariant momenta X and Y points. Unlike conventional valley systems, these valleys are related by crystal symmetries rather than time-reversal symmetry. We investigate valley-dependent physical phenomena in these materials, including Berry curvature and optical circular dichroism, revealing strong valley-contrasting behavior. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of uniaxial strain and show that it effectively lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in pronounced valley polarization. Under hole doping, this strain-induced asymmetry gives rise to a piezomagnetic response. We also explore the generation of anisotropic noncollinear spin currents in these systems, expanding the scope of their spin-related functionalities. Our findings unveil rich valley physics in monolayer Fe$_2$MoX$_4$ (X = S, Se, Te) and Fe$_2$WTe$_4$, highlighting their significant potential for applications in valleytronics, spintronics, and multifunctional nanoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Bismuth nanogratings with narrow plasmon resonances for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Chacón Sánchez, Fátima Cabello, Marina García Pardo, Emmanuel Haro-Poniatowski, Rosalía Serna, Johann Toudert</p>
            <p>Bismuth nanostructures are appealing for sustainable color generation and sunlight harvesting, thanks to their non-toxicity and their tunable visible-to-near infrared interband plasmon resonances. However, owing to their broad and polarization-insensitive spectral features, the nanostructures reported so far displayed a limited color tunability and were unsuitable for other applications such as sensing. Herein, we report bismuth nanogratings with polarization-sensitive and narrow plasmon resonances (Q > 10). They were fabricated on the $cm^2$ scale following a lithography-free approach: conformal pulsed laser deposition of bismuth onto the reflective and transparent nanostructured layers of DVDs. We characterized their specular reflectance for different orientations of the plane of incidence, angles of incidence, and polarizations of light. When light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the lines, plasmon resonances occur and shift across the visible-to-near infrared upon changing the angle of incidence. In contrast, no such resonances occur when light is polarized in the plane parallel to the lines. This results in well-contrasted, polarization-sensitive colors, which are iridescent for the former orientation of polarization, and not for the latter. Resonances strongly shift upon changing the refractive index of the surrounding medium (> 500 nm/RIU), resulting in a marked change in the plasmonic color, e.g., from green in air to red in water. This showcases the potential of these nanogratings for dynamic polarized color generation and colorimetric sensing.</p>

            <p>Current memcapacitor implementations typically demand complex fabrication processes or depend on organic materials exhibiting poor environmental stability and reproducibility. Here, we demonstrate memcapacitor structures utilizing a quasi 2-dimensional electron gas, formed at the crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface, as electrodes and SiO2/SrTiO3 as dielectric layer. The observed memcapacitance originates from the charge localization in a lateral floating gate, while an applied gate voltage enables reversible tuning of the device capacitance. Furthermore, preprogrammed or erased gate biases enable controllable shifts of the capacitance hysteresis window toward positive or negative bias, leading to an enlarged capacitance gap at zero bias. A memcapacitor model developed for this system reproduces the main features of the experimental capacitance hysteresis, capturing the effects of charge fluctuations and dielectric frequency modulation within the oxide layer. The demonstrated low-voltage operation and gate tunability of oxide interface-based memcapacitors highlight their potential for power-efficient, capacitor-based neuromorphic and synaptic electronic architectures.</p>

            <p>This work reports the electrical characteristics comparison study between Cr2O3 and NiOx based heterojunction diodes (HJD) on halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) grown \b{eta}-Ga2O3 epitaxial layers. Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios >10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 m{\Omega}*cm^2 and 12.05 m{\Omega}*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sho Araki, Hidenori Fukaya, Tetsuya Onogi, Satoshi Yamaguchi</p>
            <p>We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of Möbius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of capillary filling in tubes of regular polygon cross-section. Using Onsager variational principle, we derive a coupled ordinary differential equation and partial differential equation, which respectively describe time evolution of the bulk flow and the saturation profile of the finger flow. We obtain both numerical solution and self-similar solution to the coupled equations, and the results indicate that the bulk flow and the finger flow both follow the $t^{1/2}$ time-scaling. We show that due to the coupling effect of the finger flow, the prefactor for the bulk flow is smaller than that of the Lucas-Washburn prediction. The reduction effect is more pronounced when the side number $n$ of the regular-polygon is small, while as $n$ increases, the prefactor approaches Lucas-Washburn prediction.</p>

            <p>Cumulative geometric frustration can drive self-limited assembly and morphology selection through size-dependent energetic costs. However, the slenderness of quasi-one-dimensional systems generally suppresses the formation of long-range longitudinal gradients. We show that the suppression of longitudinal gradients can be overcome by tuning the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse (shear) moduli. We demonstrate the recovery of cumulative frustration across distinct quasi-one-dimensional systems, each frustrated through a different mechanism, by the introduction of a soft response mode.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lecheng Liang, Hengyu Li, Shao Ye, Peng Li, Kaiyang Xu, Jinhui Liang, Binwen Zeng, Bo Shen, Taisuke Ozaki, Zhiming Cui</p>
            <p>The exploration of advanced CO-free catalysts and clarifying the ambiguous kinetic origins and governing factors would undoubtedly open up opportunities to overcome the sluggish kinetics of methanol electrooxidation and promote the development of direct methanol fuel cells. Herein, we constructed a family of Bi-modified Pt3M intermetallic catalysts (Bi-Pt3M/C, M=Cr, Mn, Co, Zn, In, Ga, and Sn) that follow CO-free dominated pathway and exhibit exceptional catalytic activity. More significantly, leveraging this platform, we have identified the pivotal factor governing the reaction kinetics in CO-free pathway, namely OH binding energy (OHBE). This arises because the rate-determining step (RDS) encompasses both C-H bond activation and water dissociation, whose respective barriers can be reflected by the OHBE. Accordingly, OHBE can act as an activity descriptor. Specifically, Bi-Pt3In/C stands out from other Bi-Pt3M/C and delivers the unprecedented mass activity of 36.7 A mgPt-1 at peak potential, far exceeding state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts reported to date. Taking Bi-Pt3In/C as a proof of concept, we clearly elucidate the origin of enhanced MOR activity by combining theoretical calculations, kinetic isotope effects, and formaldehyde electrooxidation. Moreover, there exhibits a volcano-type trend between OHBE and the activity of Bi-Pt3M/C. Beyond the discovery of ultrahigh-performance catalysts, these findings provide a detailed mechanistic picture of RDS and offer an innovative design principle for advanced catalysts.</p>

            <p>Unlike discrete photonic circuits, which manipulate photons step-by-step using a series of optical elements, arrays of coupled waveguides enable photons to interfere continuously across the entire structure. When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures.</p>

            <p>Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.</p>

            <p>Quantum sensing is an emerging field with the potential to outperform classical methods in both precision and spatial resolution. However, the sensitivity of the underlying quantum platform also makes the sensors highly susceptible to their environmental noise. To address this issue, techniques from the field of quantum error mitigation use information about the noise to improve measurement results. We present a novel mitigation technique for quantum sensors to efficiently reverse the effects of any noise that can be described by a completely positive trace preserving map. The method leverages the knowledge acquired by a pre-characterization step of the device to automatically adapt to the complexity of the dissipative evolution and to indicate optimal sensing times $\tau$ to achieve the most accurate results. We demonstrate that our method reaches the best achievable sensitivity in noisy single-NV-center magnetometry. This work marks a further step toward more resilient quantum sensors with the smallest scale of resolution.</p>

We experimentally realize mechanical EPs up to the seventh order and confirm this architecture's scalability. Moreover, we reveal that the fundamental noise component and the measured signal share the same system coupling channel and thus undergo identical root-response amplification near EPs of arbitrary order, consistent with our signal-to-noise ratio measurements.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xavier R. Advincula, Christoph Schran, Angelos Michaelides</p>
            <p>Water behaves very differently at surfaces and under extreme confinement, but the boundary between these two regimes has remained unclear. Despite evidence that interfacial effects persist under sub-nanometre confinement, the molecular-scale behaviour and its evolution with slit width remain unclear. Here, we use machine-learning molecular dynamics with first-principles accuracy to probe water at graphene surfaces across slit widths ranging from the open-interface limit to angstrom-scale confinement. We find that water undergoes a sharp structural transition: when three or more water layers fit between the walls, the structure of the graphene-water interface is effectively indistinguishable from that in an open system, with density layering, hydrogen bonding, and orientational ordering retaining interfacial character. Below this threshold, however, angstrom-scale confinement strongly reorganises the liquid, producing enhanced ordering, a restructured hydrogen-bond network, and modified orientational motifs. These results establish a molecular-level picture that clearly separates interfacial behaviour from genuine nanoconfinement and provide guidance for predicting and controlling the structure of water in nanoscale solid-liquid environments.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Krylov algorithm using unitary decomposition for exact eigenstates of fermionic systems using quantum computers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush Asthana</p>
            <p>Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a useful framework for quantum simulations in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, offering a favorable trade-off between potential quantum speedups and practical resource demands. However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($\Delta t$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $\Delta t$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ of the error parameter $\epsilon$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $\epsilon \neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($\epsilon^2$) vs O($\Delta t$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $\epsilon$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $\epsilon$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage.</p>

            <p>We study the plasma branch of an homogeneous three-dimensional electron gas in an $s$-wave superconducting state. We focus on the regime where the plasma frequency $\omega_p$ is comparable to the gap $\Delta$, which is experimentally realized in cuprates. Although a sum rule guarantees that the departure of the plasma branch always coincides with the plasma frequency, the dispersion and lifetime of the plasmons is strongly affected by the presence of the pair condensate, especially at energies close to the pair-breaking threshold $2\Delta$. When $\omega_p $ is above $1.7\Delta $, the level repulsion is strong enough to give the plasma branch an anomalous, negative dispersion with a minimum at finite wavelength. At non-zero temperature and at $\omega_p>2\Delta$, we treat in a non-perturbative way the coupling of plasmons to the fermionic excitations, and show that a broadened plasma resonance inside the pair-breaking continuum coexists with an undamped solution in the band gap. This resonance splitting is associated with the presence of multiple poles in the analytic continuation of the propagator of the Cooper pairs.</p>

            <p>The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network\blu{, with arbitrary geometry,} and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, and is an essential step in generalizing active stresses on such discrete systems. It is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</p>

            <p>We compute the joint large deviation rate functional in the limit of large time for the current flowing through the edges of a finite graph on which a boundary-driven system of stochastic particles evolves with zero-range this http URL generalizes one-dimensional results previously obtained with different approaches; our alternative techniques illuminate various connections and complementary perspectives. In particular, we here use a variational approach to derive the rate functional by contraction from a level 2.5 large deviation rate functional. We perform an exact minimization and finally obtain the rate functional as a variational problem involving a superposition of cost functions for each edge. The contributions from different edges are not independent since they are related by the values of a potential function on the nodes of the graph. The rate functional on the graph is a microscopic version of the continuous rate functional predicted by the macroscopic fluctuation theory, and we indeed show a convergence in the scaling limit. If we split the graph into two connected regions by a cutset and are interested just in the current flowing through the cutset, we find that the result is the same as that of an effective system composed of only one effective edge (as happens at macroscopic level and is expected also for other models). The characteristics of this effective edge are related to the ``capacities'' of the graph and can be obtained by a reduction using elementary transformations as in electrical networks; specifically, we treat components in parallel, in series, and in $N$-star configurations (reduced to effective complete $N$-graphs). Our reduction procedure is directly related to the reduction to the trace process and, since the dynamics is in general not reversible, it is also closely connected to the theory of non-reversible electrical networks.</p>

            <p>Processes slow compared to atomic vibrations pose significant challenges in atomistic simulations, particularly for phenomena such as diffusive relaxations and phase transitions, where repeated crossings and the shear number of thermally activated transitions make direct numerical simulations impossible. We present a computational framework that captures atomic-scale diffusive relaxation over extended timescales by learning the mean first passage time (MFPT) with a deep neural network. The model is trained via a self-consistent recursive formulation based on the Markovian assumption, relying solely on local residence times and transition probabilities between neighboring states. Furthermore, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-accelerated atomistic simulations to expedite the identification of thermodynamic equilibrium and the generation of accurate physical transition probabilities. Applied to vacancy-mediated chemical short-range order (SRO) evolution in equiatomic CrCoNi, our method uncovers disorder-to-order transition timescales in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. By bridging the gap between simulation and experiment, our approach extends atomistic modeling to previously inaccessible timescales and offers a predictive tool for navigating process-structure-property relationships.</p>

            <p>The anisotropic propagation of particles is a fundamental transport phenomenon in solid state physics. As for crystalline semiconductors, the anisotropic charge transport opens novel designing routes for electronic devices, where the electrical or magnetic manipulation of anisotropic resistance provides essential guarantees. Motivated by the concept of anisotropic magnetoresistance, we develop an original theory on the electrically manipulatable anisotropic electroresistance. We show that piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics may showcase polarization-dependent anisotropic electrical conductivities between two perpendicular directions and the electrical conductivity anisotropy (ECA) is switchable by flipping the polarization. By symmetry analysis, we identify several point groups hosting the polarization-switchable ECA. These point groups simultaneously enable polarization-reversal induced conductivity change along specific directions, akin to the tunnelling electroresistance in ferroelectric tunnel junctions. First-principles-based conductivity calculations predict that piezoelectric AlP and ferroelectric KH$_2$PO$_4$ are two good semiconductors having such exotic charge transport. Our theory can motivate the design of intriguing anisotropic electronic devices (e.g., anisotropic memristor and field effect transistor).</p>

            <h2>Analytical results for the distribution of first return times of non-backtracking random walks on configuration model networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dor Lev-Ari, Ido Tishby, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav, Diego Krapf</p>
            <p>We present analytical results for the distribution of first return (FR) times of non-backtracking random walks (NBWs) on undirected configuration model networks consisting of $N$ nodes with degree distribution $P(k)$. We focus on the case in which the network consists of a single connected component. Starting from a random initial node $i$ at time $t=0$, an NBW hops into a random neighbor of $i$ at time $t=1$ and at each subsequent step it continues to hop into a random neighbor of its current node, excluding the previous node. We calculate the tail distribution $P ( T_{\rm FR} > t )$ of first return times from a random initial node to itself. It is found that $P ( T_{\rm FR} > t )$ is given by a discrete Laplace transform of the degree distribution $P(k)$. This result exemplifies the relation between structural properties of a network, captured by the degree distribution, and properties of dynamical processes taking place on the network. Using the tail-sum formula, we calculate the mean first return time ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$. Surprisingly, ${\mathbb E}[ T_{\rm FR} ]$ coincides with the result obtained from Kac's lemma that applies to simple random walks (RWs). We also calculate the variance ${\rm Var}(T_{\rm FR})$, which accounts for the variability of first return times between different NBW trajectories. We apply this formalism to Erd{\H o}s-Rényi networks, random regular graphs and configuration model networks with exponential and power-law degree distributions and obtain closed-form expressions for $P( T_{\rm FR} > t )$ as well as its mean and variance. These results provide useful insight on the advantages of NBWs over simple RWs in network exploration, sampling and search processes.</p>

            <h2>Critical Probability Distributions of the order parameter at two loops I: Ising universality class</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sankarshan Sahu</p>
            <p>There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.</p>

            <h2>Expanding the reach of diffusing wave spectroscopy and tracer bead microrheology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Manuel Helfer, Chi Zhang, Frank Scheffold</p>
            <p>Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) is an extension of standard dynamic light scattering (DLS), applied to soft materials that are turbid or opaque. The propagation of light is modeled using light diffusion, characterized by a light diffusion coefficient that depends on the transport mean free path l* of the medium. DWS is highly sensitive to small particle displacements or other local fluctuations in the scattering properties and can probe sub-nanometer displacements. Analyzing the motion of beads in a viscoelastic matrix, known as one-bead microrheology, is one of the most common applications of DWS. Despite significant advancements since its invention in the late 1980s, including two-cell and multispeckle DWS, challenges such as merging single- and multispeckle data and limited accuracy for short correlation times persist. Here, we address these issues by improving the two-cell echo DWS scheme. We propose a calibration-free method to blend and merge echo and two-cell DWS data and demonstrate the use of an exponential basis fit to enhance data quality, in particular at very short times. Building on this, we introduce stable corrections for bead and fluid inertia, significantly improving the quality of microrheology data at high frequencies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Hurtado-Gutiérrez, C. Pérez-Espigares, P.I. Hurtado</p>
            <p>Time crystals are many-body systems whose ground state spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry and thus exhibits long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Using hydrodynamics, we have recently shown how an $m$th-order external packing field coupled to density fluctuations in driven diffusive fluids can induce the spontaneous emergence of time-crystalline order in the form of $m$ rotating condensates, which can be further controlled and modulated. Here we analyze this phenomenon at the microscopic level in a paradigmatic model of particle diffusion under exclusion interactions, a generalization of the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process with a configuration-dependent field called the time-crystal lattice gas. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the nonequilibrium phase transition to these complex time-crystal phases for different values of $m$, including the order parameter, the susceptibility and the Binder cumulant, from which we measure the critical exponents, which turn out to be within the Kuramoto universality class for oscillator synchronization. We also elucidate the condensates density profiles and velocities, confirming along the way a scaling property predicted for the higher-order condensate shapes in terms of first-order ones, discussing also novel possibilities for this promising route to time crystals.</p>

            <p>The gatemon qubits, made of transparent superconducting-semiconducting Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs-Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such intrinsically large anharmonicity enables our devices to be driven coherently with raw Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz, without any pulse shaping, simplifying implementation and control compared to traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our anharmonic tunable transmons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent superconducting-semiconducting junctions bring to quantum information processing.</p>

            <h2>Universal scaling in one-dimensional non-reciprocal matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuoguang Liu, Peter B. Littlewood, Ryo Hanai</p>
            <p>Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward non-equilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example arises in non-reciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the coalescence of collective modes with an existing Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the universal scaling behavior that emerges in this system with full consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic one-dimensional (1D) stochastic non-reciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through large-scale simulations, we uncover a new non-equilibrium scaling in the vicinity of the CEP, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or non-equilibrium universality classes. We report an anomalously large roughening exponent $\alpha_{\rm CEP}=1.35(5)$, which is to be compared with those of simple diffusion $\alpha_{\rm EW}=0.5$. In regimes where the system breaks into domains with opposite chirality and spatiotemporal vortices inevitably emerge, we find that fluctuations are strongly suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$ that manifests a short-range correlation. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of non-reciprocal matter, thereby shedding light on the exploration of criticality in non-reciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and non-Hermitian physics.</p>

            <p>A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samantha J. Fournier, Alessandro Pacco, Valentina Ros, Pierfrancesco Urbani</p>
            <p>We investigate a model of high-dimensional dynamical variables with all-to-all interactions that are random and non-reciprocal. We characterize its phase diagram and show that the model can exhibit chaotic dynamics. We show that the equations describing the system's dynamics exhibit a number of equilibria that is exponentially large in the dimensionality of the system, and these equilibria are all linearly unstable in the chaotic phase. Solving the effective equations governing the dynamics in the infinite-dimensional limit, we determine the typical properties (magnetization, overlap) of the configurations belonging to the attractor manifold. We show that these properties cannot be inferred from those of the equilibria, challenging the expectation that chaos can be understood purely in terms of the numerous unstable equilibria of the dynamical equations. We discuss the dependence of this scenario on the strength of non-reciprocity in the interactions. These results are obtained through a combination of analytical methods such as Dynamical Mean-Field Theory and the Kac-Rice formalism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Ghadai, Pradip Kumar Bera, Sayantan Majumdar</p>
            <p>A particle moving through a worm-like micellar fluid (WLM) shows instability and large fluctuations beyond a threshold \textcolor{black}{velocity/force (depending on the control parameter used)}. Despite many detailed studies, a direct measurement of the time-dependent stress on the probe particle remains unexplored. To address this, we have designed a measuring geometry coupled with a commercial rheometer to study the dynamics of a cylindrical probe through a WLM system of 2 wt.\% cetyltrimethyl ammonium tosylate(CTAT) + 100 mM sodium chloride(NaCl) for a wide range of velocity and stress scales. We map out the in-situ velocity distribution using particle imaging velocimetry. Beyond a velocity threshold, we observe large stress fluctuation with gradual stress build-up followed by sudden stress drop indicating storage and release of elastic energy. The length scale constructed from the stress build-up time scale and the probe's velocity match the length scale of extensile deformation just before the stress drop, confirming the strong correlation of storage and release of energy with the unstable probe motion. Interestingly, the Weissenberg number ($Wi$) for the onset of flow instability obtained from the shear and extensile components remains almost the same. We also find that the turbulent motion of the probe at higher $Wi$ results from the complex mixing of the stick-slip events originating from the partial release of the stored elastic energy. Further, we show that the magnitude of the stick-slip events depends on the detailed micellar structure and dynamics controlled by salt concentration and temperature.</p>

            <h2>Indirect Tunneling Enabled Spontaneous Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking and Josephson Diode Effect in TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_2$/Nb tunnel junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shaoqing Ding, Jinyuan Yao, Zhen Bi, Quyen Tran, Bangzhi Liu, Qi Li, Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Thomas N. Jackson, Ying Liu</p>
            <p>Josephson diode (JD) effect found in Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its importance for developing superconducting circuitry based quantum technologies. So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect.</p>

            <h2>Gyrotropic magnetic effect in metallic chiral magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nisarga Paul, Takamori Park, Jung Hoon Han, Leon Balents</p>
            <p>We study the gyrotropic magnetic effect (GME), the low-frequency limit of optical gyrotropy, in metals and semimetals coupled to chiral spin textures. In these systems, the chiral spin texture which lacks inversion symmetry can imprint itself upon the electronic structure through Hund's coupling, leading to novel low-frequency optical activity. Using perturbation theory and numerical diagonalization of both relativistic and non-relativistic models of conduction electrons coupled to spin textures, we analyze how the GME manifests in both single-$q$ and multi-$q$ textures. Analytical expressions for the rotatory power are derived in terms of universal scaling functions. Estimates based on realistic material parameters reveal an experimentally viable range of values for the rotatory power. The GME arises from the orbital and spin magnetic moments of conduction electrons, with the orbital part closely tied to Berry curvature and playing a significant role in relativistic metals but not so in non-relativistic metals where there is no inherent Berry curvature. The spin contribution to the GME can be significant in non-relativistic metals with a large Fermi energy. Our work establishes the GME as a sensitive probe of magnetic chirality and symmetry breaking in metallic chiral magnets.</p>

The phase diagram reveals floppy states with vanishing shear and in-plane bulk moduli, alongside a lateral-tension-driven discontinuous columnar-to-squamous transition. The critical behavior underlying the emergence of the reentrant transition belongs to the mean-field universality class.</p>

            <p>Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.</p>

We present the ideas after the main theoretical frameworks to study open-quantum systems out of equilibrium, that are useful to study quantum transport under time-dependent driving.

Our primary focus is on electronic systems, where decades of research have established a rich theoretical foundation and a wealth of experimental realizations. Topics of interest include quantum optics with electrons, high-precision electron spectroscopy, quantum electrical metrology, and the critical role of quantum fluctuations in transport and thermodynamics. We also extend the discussion to atomic, molecular, and optical systems, as well as nanomechanical platforms, which offer complementary perspectives and are currently experiencing rapid experimental development. Finally, we examine the intersection of time-dependent transport and topological matter, a domain of active investigation. This review aims to gather the diverse approaches and emerging trends that define the current landscape of quantum transport research under time-dependent conditions, bridging theoretical insights with experimental advances across multiple physical platforms.</p>

            <p>We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.</p>

            <h2>Phonon-confinement theory of thermal conductivity in ultrathin silicon films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines so as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</p>

            <h2>Generalized non-reciprocal phase transitions in multipopulation systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cheyne Weis, Ryo Hanai</p>
            <p>Non-reciprocal interactions are prevalent in various complex systems leading to phenomena that cannot be described by traditional equilibrium statistical physics. Although non-reciprocally interacting systems composed of two populations have been closely studied, the physics of non-reciprocal systems with a general number of populations is not well explored despite the relevance to biological systems, active matter, and driven-dissipative quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the generic features of the phases and phase transitions and emerge in $O(2)$ symmetric many-body systems with multiple non-reciprocally coupled populations, applicable to microscopic models such as networks of oscillators, flocking models, and more generally systems where each agent has a phase variable. Using symmetry and topology of the possible orbits, we systematically show that a rich variety of time-dependent phases and phase transitions arise. Examples include multipopulation chiral phases that are distinct from their two-population counterparts that emerge via a phase transition characterized by critical exceptional points, as well as limit cycle saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. Interestingly, we find a phase transition that dynamically restores the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry occurs via a homoclinic orbit bifurcation, where the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ broken orbits merge at the phase transition point, providing a general route to homoclinic chaos in the order parameter dynamics for $N\geq4$ populations. Our framework provides general principles for understanding non-equilibrium heterogeneous systems and guides experimental exploration into such systems.</p>

            <p>Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as domain wall and vortices, for example, bind robust midgap states at zero energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests all-real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions ($v_{_{\rm F}}$). From the explicit solutions of the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially nontrivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be found in the spectrum when $v_{_{\rm F}}$ is real.

            <h2>Steady state diagram of interacting fermionic atoms coupled to dissipative cavities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luisa Tolle, Ameneh Sheikhan, Thierry Giamarchi, Corinna Kollath, Catalin-Mihai Halati</p>
            <p>We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</p>

            <p>We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in materials informatics have expanded the number of synthesizable materials. However, screening promising candidates, such as semiconductors, based on defect properties remains challenging. This is primarily due to the lack of a general framework for predicting defect formation energies in multiple charge states from structural data. In this Letter, we present a protocol, namely data normalization, Fermi level alignment, and treatment of perturbed host states, and validate it by accurately predicting oxygen vacancy formation energies in three charge states using a single model. We also introduce a joint machine-learning model that integrates defect formation energies and band-edge predictions for virtual screening. Using this framework, we identify 89 hole-dopable oxides, including BaGaSbO, a potential ambipolar photovoltaic material. Our protocol is expected to become a standard approach for machine-learning studies on point defect formation energies.</p>

            <p>The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric materials requires models that are both accurate and interpretable. Traditional machine learning approaches, while effective at property prediction, often act as black boxes and provide limited physical insight. In this work, we introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) for the prediction of thermoelectric properties, focusing on the Seebeck coefficient and band gap. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs achieve comparable predictive accuracy while offering explicit symbolic representations of structure--property relationships. This dual capability enables both reliable predictions and the extraction of physically meaningful functional forms. Benchmarking against literature models further highlights the robustness and generalisability of the approach. Our findings demonstrate that KANs provide a powerful framework for reverse engineering materials with targeted thermoelectric properties, bridging the gap between predictive performance and scientific interpretability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex D. Kerin, Barbara Dietz, Joachim Brand</p>
            <p>Among the fundamental symmetry classes of quantum chaotic systems in Dyson's threefold way, the symplectic class is rarely observed in nature. Characterized by the strongest possible level repulsion in the energy spectrum, the symplectic symmetry class also implies a double (Kramers) degeneracy of levels. Studying the spectral statistics of three quantum particles (identical bosons or mass-imbalanced fermions) in a harmonic trap, we find numerical evidence for strong level repulsion in the regime of weak contact interactions. While the statistical indicators are consistent with quantum chaos in systems with symplectic symmetry, the absence of Kramers degeneracy rules out this symmetry. In the strongly-interacting unitary limit either Poissonian or stick statistics are observed (depending on commensurability of the mass ratio) indicating regular dynamics.</p>

            <p>The theory of open quantum systems is one of the most essential tools for the development of quantum technologies. A particular area of interest is in the optical response of solid state systems, where dissipation is introduced phenomenologically through the relaxation time approximation and its effects are usually gauged perturbatively. Analytical exact results for driven systems under this approximation are scarce and tipically pertain only to the stationary regime. Here, we obtain the analytical solution for the current response of general single-band tight-binding system driven by a uniform electric field with generic time-dependence under the relaxation time approximation. We explore the effects of dissipation in two limiting cases: A monochromatic field, where we analytically deduce the effect of dissipation on High Harmonic Generation, and a constant electric field, where a generalization for the Esaki-Tsu equation is presented for any single-band tight-binding system. We specify the results for a simple 2D nearest neighbours tight-binding lattice to emphasize the effect of the scale competition introduced by the two different neighbours in both the monochromatic and constant field cases. Finally, we compare our exact result for the constant field to the one obtained from the usual perturbation theory calculation to probe the validity of the latter.</p>

            <p>Discovering materials with new structural chemistry is key to achieving transformative functionality. Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable route to propose candidate crystal structures. We introduce a reliable low-cost proxy for structural novelty as a conditioning property to steer generation towards novel yet physically plausible structures. We then develop a physics-informed diffusion model that embeds this descriptor of local environment diversity together with compactness as a stability metric to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across diffusion models, shifting generation away from structural motifs that dominate the training data. A chemically grounded validation protocol isolates those candidates that combine plausibility with structural novelty for physics-based calculation of energetic stability. Both the stability and the novelty of candidates emerging from this workflow can however change when the full potential energy surface at a candidate composition is evaluated with crystal structure prediction (CSP). This suggests a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration, where AI targets physically viable yet structurally distinct regions of chemical space for detailed physics-based assessment of novelty and stability.</p>

            <h2>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Jarzynski equality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Rahbar, Christopher J. Stein</p>
            <p>We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumya Sur, Mohammad Saad, Adhip Agarwala</p>
            <p>An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{this https URL}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aamna Ahmed, Mónica Benito, Beatriz Pérez-González</p>
            <p>Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.</p>

            <p>A generic question in the field of ultrafast dynamics is concerned with the relaxation dynamics and the subsequent thermalization of optically excited charge carriers. Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio.</p>

            <p>We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $\omega(q)$ to the optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $\omega(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with weakly $T$-dependent $\omega[q_c(T)] \approx 2\Delta(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.</p>

            <p>We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincaré-type operators developed in our companion study arXiv:2512.08684, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</p>

            <h2>Statistical Field Theory of Interacting Nambu Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tamiaki Yoneya</p>
            <p>We develop a statistical field theory for classical Nambu dynamics by employing partially the method of quantum field theory. One of unsolved problems in Nambu dynamics has been to extend it to interacting systems without violating a generalized canonical structure associated with the presence of multiple Hamiltonians, which together govern the dynamics of time evolution on an equal footing. In the present paper, we propose to include interactions from the standpoint of classical statistical dynamics by formulating it as a field theory on Nambu's generalized phase space in an operator formalism. We first construct a general framework for such a field theory and its probabilistic interpretation. Then, on the basis of this new framework, we give a simple model of self-interaction in a many-body Nambu system treated as a closed dynamical system satisfying the H-theorem. It is shown that a generalized micro-canonical ensemble and a generalized canonical ensemble characterized by many temperatures are reached dynamically as equilibrium states, starting with certain classes of initial non-equilibrium states via continuous Markov processes. Compared with the usual classical statistical mechanics on the basis of standard Hamiltonian dynamics, some important new features associated with Nambu dynamics will emerge, with respect to the symmetries underlying dynamics of the non-equilibrium as well as the equilibrium states and also to some conceptual properties, such as a formulation of a generalized KMS-like condition characterizing the generalized canonical equilibrium states and a `relative' nature of the temperatures.</p>

            <p>Wide band gap materials are particularly relevant at high temperatures. The band gap shrinkage at higher temperatures prevents device applications with narrow band gap semiconductors. Considering $\alpha$-phase strontium cyanurate as a prototype structure, we identify a group of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit ultra-wide band gaps ranging from 5.5 to 5.7 eV. Recently, a strontium cyanurate compound was found to undergo a phase transition from a high-symmetry $\beta$-phase to a low-symmetry ferroelectric $\alpha$-phase when the temperature was reduced. In the present study, utilizing group theory techniques, we unravel that a zone-center $\Gamma_2^-$ phonon mode modifies our structures from high-symmetry $\beta$-phase to a low-symmetry $\alpha$-phase for A$_3$(O$_3$C$_3$N$_3$)$_2$ MOFs with A = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. We implement first-principles calculations to investigate structural, ferroelectric, and optical properties of these compounds in $\alpha$-phase. The switching barriers between bistable polar states are also estimated. Further, to realize their feasibility, we examine the dynamical and thermal stabilities for all of these MOFs.</p>

The spin register exhibits spin echo coherence times of $0.41(2)$~ms for the electron spin, $112(12)$~ms for the hydrogen nuclear spin, and $67(7)$~ms for the silicon nuclear spin. We use nuclear-nuclear two-qubit gates to generate entanglement between the two nuclear spins with a fidelity of $F=0.77(3)$ and a coherence time of $T^*_2=2.60(8)$~ms.

            <p>We examine the impact of moderate repulsive self-interactions on fuzzy dark matter halos generated by merging smaller Gaussian density concentrations. We study the size of the core and the granules, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton, covering the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the solitonic core. For the probed self-coupling strengths $g$ and with a fixed initial configuration, mergers with increasing $g$ result in cores with increased size and a reduced central density, oscillating with decreased frequency, in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. By contrast, the characteristic granule size and typical inter-vortex distances in the surrounding halo are only mildly affected, growing much less relative to the core. The total length of the vortex network, although less robust, shows no signs of decay over our simulation timescales. The generated halos therefore develop central self-interaction-dominated cores, but with the outer halos still supported by quantum-pressure and classical kinetic energy in equipartition as in the non-interacting case. Furthermore, measures of coherence of the field clearly separate the condensed core, identified via the Penrose-Onsager (largest eigenvalue) mode of the entire classical field, from the surrounding quasi-coherent halo. Unlike the $g=0$ case, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing $g$, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nachiket Karve, Nathan Rose, David Campbell</p>
            <p>While classical chaos is defined via a system's sensitive dependence on its initial conditions (SDIC), this notion does not directly extend to quantum systems. Instead, recent works have established defining both quantum and classical chaos via the sensitivity to adiabatic deformations and measuring this sensitivity using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP). Building on this formalism, we introduce the ``observable drift" as a probe of chaos in generic, non-Hamiltonian, classical systems. We show that this probe correctly characterizes classical systems that exhibit SDIC as chaotic. Moreover, this characterization is consistent with the measure-theoretic definition of chaos via weak mixing. Thus, we show that these two notions of sensitivity (to changes in initial conditions and to adiabatic deformations) can be probed using the same quantity, and therefore, are equivalent definitions of chaos. Numerical examples are provided via the tent map, the logistic map, and the Chirikov standard map.</p>

For $GW$ HOMO-LUMO gaps, the double-zeta augmented MOLOPT basis yields a mean absolute deviation of 60 meV to the complete basis set limit. The basis set convergence for excitation energies from time-dependent density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is similar.

            <p>Tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS), are powerful ansätze for simulating quantum dynamics. While both ansätze are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 8767-8781] reported a non-negligible discrepancy in its calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for MPS and TTNS. By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we reduce the relative difference in occupancy for weakly populated electronic states from up to 60% towards the end of the simulation to less than 10% and the absolute difference from 0.05 to 0.005. We also discuss the impact of tensor network structures on accuracy and efficiency, with the difference further reduced by an optimized TTNS structure. Our results confirm that both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ben Britton, Tianbi Zhang</p>
            <p>We present a simple 'shift-and-add' based improvement in the angular resolution of single electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis. In particular, this method has the potential to enhance the scope of small compact direct electron detectors (DEDs).</p>

            <h2>Statistical physics of deep learning: Optimal learning of a multi-layer perceptron near interpolation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean Barbier, Francesco Camilli, Minh-Toan Nguyen, Mauro Pastore, Rudy Skerk</p>
            <p>For four decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or ones with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. Therefore, we provide the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and identify the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data, optimal performance is attained through the model's "specialisation" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayes-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant in much more general settings.</p>

            <h2>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Abraham</p>
            <p>Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</p>

            <h2>Planckian Bounds via Spectral Moments of Optical Conductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>The observation of Planckian scattering, often inferred from Drude fits in strongly correlated metals, raises the question of how to extract an intrinsic timescale from measurable quantities in a model-independent way. We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.</p>

            <p>Hall viscosity is a quantized nondissipative stress response of a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid to adiabatic geometric deformations. Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime.</p>

            <h2>Universal relaxation speedup in open quantum systems through transient conditional and unconditional resetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parvinder Solanki, Igor Lesanovsky, Gabriele Perfetto</p>
            <p>Speeding up the relaxation dynamics of many-body quantum systems is important in a variety of contexts, including quantum computation and state preparation. We demonstrate that such acceleration can be universally achieved via transient stochastic resetting. This means that during an initial time interval of finite duration, the dynamics is interrupted by resets that take the system to a designated state at randomly selected times. We illustrate this idea for few-body open systems and also for a challenging many-body case, where a first-order phase transition leads to a divergence of relaxation time. In all scenarios, a significant and sometimes even exponential acceleration in reaching the stationary state is observed, similar to the so-called Mpemba effect. The universal nature of this speedup lies in the fact that the design of the resetting protocol only requires knowledge of a few macroscopic properties of the target state, such as the order parameter of the phase transition, while it does not necessitate any fine-tuned manipulation of the initial state.</p>

            <p>Magnetic flux quantization in units of $\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is a defining feature of superconductivity, rooted in the charge-2e nature of Cooper pairs. In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $\Phi_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $\pi$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $\pi$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $\pi$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $\pi$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are key building blocks for photonic quantum technologies, enabling practical sources of non-classical light. A central challenge for scalable integration is the direct epitaxial growth of high-quality emitters on industry-compatible silicon platforms. Furthermore, for long-distance fiber-based quantum communication, emission in the telecom O- or C-band is essential. Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of high-quality InGaAs/GaAs QDs emitting in the telecom O-band using a strain-reducing layer approach on silicon. Deterministic integration of individual QDs into circular Bragg grating resonators is achieved via in-situ electron-beam lithography. The resulting devices exhibit strong out-coupling enhancement, with photon extraction efficiencies up to $(40 \pm 2)\%$, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. These results highlight the high material quality of both the epitaxial platform and the photonic nanostructure, as well as the precise lateral positioning of the emitter within 20~nm of the resonator center. At cryogenic temperature (4~K) and low excitation power ($0.027\times P_\text{sat}$), the devices show excellent single-photon purity, exceeding 99\%. Operation at elevated temperatures of 40~K and 77~K, compatible with compact Stirling cryo-coolers and liquid-nitrogen cooling, reveals robust performance, with single-photon purity maintained at $(88.4 \pm 0.6)\%$ at 77~K. These results demonstrate a practical and scalable route toward silicon-based quantum light sources and provide a promising path for cost-effective fabrication and seamless integration of quantum photonics with classical electronics, representing an important step toward large-scale, chip-based quantum information systems.</p>

            <h2>Two-dimensional helical superconductivity and gapless superconducting edge modes in the 1T$^\prime$-WS$_2$/2H-WS$_2$ heterophase bilayer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuance Jiang, Jennifer Cano, Yuan Ping, Yafis Barlas, Deyu Lu</p>
            <p>We propose a material platform comprised of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) heterostructures to realize the two-dimensional (2D) helical superconductivity with an intrinsic gap. By van der Waals stacking a 2D superconductor (1T$^\prime$-WS$_2$ with inversion symmetry) on top of a 2D topological insulator (2H-WS$_2$ with mirror symmetry), the resulting TMDC bilayer exhibits Rashba superconductivity. Under an external in-plane magnetic field, the system can host finite-momentum Cooper pairing, evidenced by the divergence in the particle-particle susceptibility of a $k\cdot p$ Hamiltonian fitted to the \textit{ab initio} theory band structure. The resulting 2D helical superconducting phase can induce superconductivity in the edge states with its spatially varying order parameter. By varying the strength of the in-plane magnetic field, we demonstrate that the helical edge state can undergo a phase transition to a one-dimensional gapless phase with narrow Fermi segments corresponding to zero-energy Bogoliubov quasi-particles. The controllable one-dimensional gapless phase serves as a clear experimental fingerprint of 2D helical superconductivity. The proposed 2D TMDC heterostructure is promising for intrinsic nonreciprocal superconducting transport and the development of Majorana-based quantum devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoru Ohgata, Satoru Hayami</p>
            <p>Multi-$Q$ magnets consist of superposed spin density waves with distinct magnetic modulation vectors, enabling a wide range of magnetic orders depending on their combination. Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect. This mechanism accounts for the observed giant anomalous Hall effect in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ and GdRu$_2$Ge$_2$, thereby highlighting topologically trivial double-$Q$ spin textures as promising spintronic materials.</p>

            <p>The superconducting transition temperature Tc at KTaO3-based oxide interfaces exhibits a dramatic dependence on crystallographic orientation, yet a unifying principle has remained elusive. Here, we discover a universal linear scaling between Tc and a single geometric parameter - the angle {\theta} between the (hkl) plane and the (100) plane - across ten different orientations of LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces. With the exception of (100), all orientations exhibit two dimensional superconductivity, with transition temperatures Tc ranging from ~ 0.12 K to 1.9 K. This linear {\theta}-Tc scaling is robust against variations in growth temperature, device geometry, and transport configuration. By establishing geometric orientation as a direct control knob for pairing strength, our results impose a critical benchmark for microscopic theories of superconductivity in KTaO3-based systems.</p>

            <p>In a collinear magnet, the predominant magnetic moments are collectively aligned along a specific spatial orientation, and this alignment may yield intriguing phenomena such as spin orientation driven polarization. It is well known that spin orientation driven polarization is a relativistic effect that widely occurs in various type-II multiferroics. However, a universal theory that describes such a phenomenon and directs the corresponding materials discovery is lacking. Here, we revisit the magnetic structures of collinear magnets and explore the spin-orientation-dependent phenomena therein. Based on symmetry principles, we analyze the spin point groups (SPGs) that are associated with collinear magnets in the non-relativistic regime, demonstrate how relativistic spin-orbit interaction reduces each SPG to various magnetic point groups that are associated with different magnetic alignments, and classify the SPGs with respect to spin orientation driven polarization. We employ our theory to elucidate the mechanisms of spin orientation driven polarization in a variety of type-II multiferroics. Combined with first-principles simulations, we further show that polarization may be driven in nonpolar collinear antiferromagnets (e.g., CuFeS$_2$) by reorienting their magnetic alignments. Our theory provides guidelines for designing and discovering materials with spin orientation driven polarization, which will benefit the development of spintronics based on type-II multiferroics and related materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Ohorodnyk, Chen-Hsuan Hsu</p>
            <p>Two parallel helical edge channels hosting interacting electrons, when proximitized by local and nonlocal pairings, can host time-reversal-invariant pairs of topological zero modes at the system corners. Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.</p>

            <p>Electric field induced spin-orbit torques are the crucial mechanism for electric regulations of antiferromagnetic order. However, the spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnets and the induced spin dynamics remain largely unexplored. In this work, the full classifications of SOTs in bulk collinear AFMs have been achieved based on magnetic point group. Dependent on the symmetries connecting the opposite spin sublattices, the SOTs are classified into six distinct types. Among them, the SOTs and the induced Neel vector dynamics in three representative AFMs have been investigated, where the spin sublattices are connected by fractional translation, spatial inversion, and neither by translation nor inversion symmetry respectively. The SOTs on spin sublattices have been calculated by first-principles calculations based on Kubo linear response theory, and then the induced spin dynamics are simulated by LLG equations. In typical PT symmetric AFM and the inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the simulations indicate that the deterministic switching of Neel vectors can be driven by field like torques. What's more, the fully electric writing of multiple antiferromagnetic domains into single domain state with preset Neel vector direction and 180 deterministic switching may also be realized. Our work may shed light on the current control of antiferromagnetic orders in collinear AFMs. Especially, for inversion symmetry breaking altermagnet, the electric writing and reading of Neel vector are highly desirable for antiferromagnetic memory applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Toso, Derek Dardzinski, Liberato Manna, Noa Marom</p>
            <p>Colloidal epitaxial heterostructures are nanoparticles composed of two different materials connected at an interface, which can exhibit properties different from those of their individual components. Combining dissimilar materials offers opportunities to create several functional heterostructures. Yet, assessing structural compatibility (the main prerequisite for epitaxial growth) is challenging when pairing complex materials with different lattice parameters/crystal structures. This complicates both the selection of target heterostructures for synthesis and the assignment of interface models when new heterostructures are obtained. Here, we demonstrate Ogre as a powerful tool to accelerate the design and characterization of colloidal heterostructures. To this end we implemented developments tailored for the efficient prediction of epitaxial interfaces between ionic/polar materials, which encompass most colloidal semiconductors. These include pre-screening candidate models based on charge balance at the interface and using a classical potential for fast energy evaluations, with parameters automatically extracted from the input bulk structures. These developments are validated for CsPbBr3/Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, where Ogre produces interface models in agreement with density functional theory and experiments. Furthermore, we use Ogre to rationalize the templating effect of CsPbCl3 on the growth of lead sulfochlorides, where perovskite seeds induce the formation of Pb4S3Cl2 rather than Pb3S2Cl2 due to better epitaxial compatibility. Combining Ogre simulations with experimental data enables us to unravel the structure and composition of the hitherto unsolved CsPbBr3/BixPbySz interface and assign a structure to many other reported metal halide/oxide based interfaces.

However, its accuracy is generally low, particularly, when compared with the typical accuracy of other methods such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV. Furthermore, this combination of INDO/s and ML produces UV-Vis absorption spectra that are in good agreement with the TDDFT predictions.</p>

            <p>We show that a small charged probe near a spherical topological insulator causes the latter to rotate around a symmetry axis defined by the center of the sphere and the position of the charge outside the latter. The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $\omega=(N\alpha)^2\Upsilon(\epsilon,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $\Upsilon$ depends on the dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$.</p>

            <p>Elemental antimony (Sb) is a promising material for phase-change memory, neuromorphic computing and nanophotonic applications, because its compositional simplicity can prevent phase segregation upon extensive programming. Scaling down the film thickness is a necessary step to prolong the lifetime of amorphous Sb, but the optical properties of Sb are also significantly altered as the thickness is reduced to a few nanometers, adding complexity to device optimization. In this work, we aim to provide atomistic understanding of the thickness-dependent optical responses in Sb thin films. As thickness decreases, both the extinction coefficient and optical contrast reduce in the near-infrared spectrum, consistent with previous optical measurements. Such thickness dependence gives rise to a bottom thickness limit of 2 nm in photonic applications, as predicted by coarse-grained device simulations. Further bonding analysis reveals a fundamentally different behavior for amorphous and crystalline Sb upon downscaling, resulting in the reduction of optical contrast. Thin film experiments are also carried out to validate our predictions. The thickness-dependent optical trend is fully demonstrated by our ellipsometric spectroscopy experiments, and the bottom thickness limit of 2 nm is confirmed by structural characterization experiments. Finally, we show that the greatly improved amorphous-phase stability of the 2 nm Sb thin film enables robust and reversible optical switching in a silicon-based waveguide device.</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have revealed signatures of small Fermi pockets in the pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors, most notably the Yamaji effect observed in $\mathrm{HgBa}_2\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$. The Yang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ) model provides a successful phenomenological description of the pseudogap state and naturally predicts such small pockets. In this work, we use a microscopic framework to calculate angle-dependent magnetoresistance and quantum oscillation within the YRZ model. Our calculations simultaneously reproduce the experimentally observed Yamaji oscillations and the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation corresponding to a pocket area of about $p/8$, with $p$ the hole density. By further testing the effect of Green's-function zeros, we confirm that isolated zeros leave the oscillation period unchanged, whereas an extended zero segment suppresses and modifies the oscillation. Our findings demonstrate that the YRZ model captures essential features of the pseudogap regime and provides a general quantum approach that can be applied to more complex electronic structures.</p>

            <p>Multilayered synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) are artificial three-dimensional (3D) architectures engineered to create novel, complex, and stable spin textures. Non-invasive and quantitative nanoscale magnetic imaging of the two-dimensional stray field profile at the sample surface is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of the spin-structure and being able to tailor them to achieve new functionalities. However, the deterministic detection of spin textures and their quantitative characterization on the nanoscale remain challenging. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy scanning probe microscopy (NV-SPM) under ambient conditions to perform the first quantitative vector-field magnetometry measurements in the multilayered SAF [(Co/Pt)$_5$/Co/Ru]$_3$/(Co/Pt)$_6$. We investigate nanoscale static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains with boundaries hosting ``one-dimensional'' ferromagnetic stripes with ~ 100 nm of width and periodic modulation of the magnetization. By employing NV-SPM measurements in different imaging modes and involving NV-probes with various crystallographic orientations, we demonstrated distinct fingerprints emerging from GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields on the order of several mT. This provides quantitative insights into the structure of domains and domain walls, as well as, into magnetic noise associated with thermal spin-waves. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantitative vector-field magnetometry of modern magnetic materials with tailored 3D spin textures and stray field profiles, and potentially novel spin-wave dispersions--in a quantitative and non-invasive manner, with exceptional magnetic sensitivity and nanometer scale spatial resolution.</p>

            <h2>Discreteness-induced spatial chaos versus fluctuation-induced spatial order in stochastic Turing pattern formation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yusuke Yanagisawa, Shin-ichi Sasa</p>
            <p>We investigate Turing pattern formation in a stochastic reaction-diffusion model defined on $N$ lattice sites, where each lattice site is associated with a reaction vessel of volume $\Omega$. We focus on a regime where spatial discreteness plays a crucial role, namely when the characteristic length of patterns is comparable to the lattice spacing. In this setting, we compare two different limiting procedures and show that they lead to qualitatively different outcomes. If we first take the deterministic limit $\Omega \to \infty$ and then the long-time limit $t \to \infty$, the stationary solutions of the corresponding spatially discrete deterministic equations become spatially chaotic in the limit $N\to\infty$. In contrast, if we first take the limit $t \to \infty$ and then take an appropriate limit of $\Omega \to \infty$ and $N\to\infty$, the resulting patterns are spatially periodic.</p>

            <h2>Thermally-controlled interlayer exchange and field-induced anisotropy in synthetic antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Kozlov, V. Kalita, S. Reshetniak, A. Kravets, D. Polishchuk, V. Korenivski</p>
            <p>Interlayer exchange in synthetic antiferromagnets incorporating thin paramagnetic spacers can be controlled thermally. The spacer provides an additional ferromagnetic contribution that renormalizes the otherwise temperature-independent interlayer coupling. As a result, the system shows antiferromagnetic alignment at high temperatures and ferromagnetic alignment at low temperatures. This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point. Although the Fe layers lack intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the magnetization reversal demonstrates a field-induced uniaxial anisotropy of antiferromagnetic character. The resulting reversal process resembles that of a metamagnet with a spin-flip transition.</p>

            <h2>Electronic structure, orbital-dependent renormalizations, and magnetic correlations in double-layer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under doping tuning</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. V. Leonov</p>
            <p>Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach we study the effects of electronic correlations and doping on the normal state electronic structure of the double-layer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $\chi({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the Néel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).</p>

            <p>We employ a molecular dynamics (MD) study to explore pattern selection in binary fluid mixtures ($AB$) undergoing surface-directed spinodal decomposition on a chemically patterned amorphous substrate. We chose a checkerboard pattern with chemically distinct square patches of a side $M$, with neighboring patches preferring different particle types. We report the efficient transposition of the substrate's pattern as a \emph{registry} to the fluid cross sections in its vicinity when the pattern's periodicity $\lambda/\sigma \simeq 2M$ ($\sigma$ being the fluid particle size) is larger than the mixture's spinodal length scale $\lambda_c/\sigma \simeq 2\pi/\xi_B$ ($\xi_B$ being the bulk correlation length). Our correlation analysis between the surface field and the surface-\emph{registries} in the substrate's normal direction shows that the associated decay length, $L_{\perp}(t)$, increases with decreasing pattern periodicity ($\lambda$). $L_{\perp}(t)$ also exhibits diffusive growth with time $\sim t^{1/3}$, similar to wetting-layer growth for chemically homogeneous walls. Our MD results also show the emergence of composition waves parallel to the substrate, whose wavelength exhibits dynamical scaling with a power-law growth in time $L_{||}(z,t)\sim t^{\alpha}$. $L_{||}(z,t)$ shows dynamical crossovers from a transient \emph{surface-registry} regime to universal \emph{phase-separation} regimes for cross-sections with \emph{registries}. We also give an account of the scaling of \emph{registry's} formation and melting times with patch sizes.</p>

            <h2>Friction modifies the quasistatic mechanical response of a confined, poroelastic medium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Térence Desclaux, Callum Cuttle, Chris W. MacMinn, Olivier Liot</p>
            <p>The mechanical response of elastic porous media confined within rigid geometries is central to a wide range of industrial, geological, and biomedical systems. However, current models for these problems typically overlook the role of wall friction, and particularly its interaction with confinement. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to describe the interplay between the mechanics of the medium and Coulomb friction at the confining walls for slow, quasistatic deformations in response to two canonical uniaxial forcings: piston-driven loading and fluid-driven loading, followed by unloading. We find that, during compression, the stress field evolves according to a quasistatic advection-diffusion equation, extending classical poroelasticity results. The magnitude of friction is controlled by a single dimensionless number proportional to the friction coefficient and the aspect ratio of the confining geometry. During decompression, a portion of the solid matrix remains stuck due to friction, leading to hysteresis and to the propagation of a slip front. In piston-driven loading, the frictional stress is directly coupled to the solid effective stress, leading to exponential damping of the loading and striking changes to the displacement field. However, this coupling limits the energy dissipated by friction. In fluid-driven loading, the pressure gradient locally adds energy, decoupling the frictional stress from the effective stress. The displacement remains qualitatively unchanged but is quantitatively reduced due to large energy dissipation. In both cases, friction can have a substantial impact on the apparent mechanical properties of the medium.</p>

            <h2>Janus Percolation in Anisotropic Limited-Degree Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo A. Garofalo, Nuno A.M. Araújo, Lucilla de Arcangelis, Alessandro Sarracino, Eugenio Lippiello</p>
            <p>Many real-world infrastructures, from sensor and road networks to power grids, are spatially embedded and anisotropic, with constraints on the maximum number of links each node can establish. Such systems can be represented as anisotropic limited-degree networks, in which each node forms at most q outgoing links preferentially oriented along a fixed direction. By increasing the node density sigma at fixed q, we uncover a reentrant percolation transition: a giant strongly connected component emerges, but unexpectedly disintegrates again at high densities. This counterintuitive behavior implies that adding nodes, normally expected to enhance robustness, can instead reduce mutual accessibility and weaken global connectivity. The critical behavior displays two coexisting "faces": random-percolation scaling along the preferred direction and directed-percolation scaling transversely, therefore we name this phenomenon Janus percolation, in analogy with the dual-faced Roman god. These findings demonstrate that anisotropy and degree limitation can jointly induce a novel reentrant connectivity with mixed universality that bridges the universality classes of random and directed percolation, providing fresh insight into how structural constraints shape connectivity and resilience in spatial networks.</p>

            <h2>Binding of holes and competing spin-charge order in simple and extended Hubbard model on cylindrical lattice: An exact diagonalization study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Fahad Equbal, M. A. H. Ahsan</p>
            <p>We investigate the binding of holes and the emergence of competing spin-charge order in the simple and extended Hubbard model using exact diagonalization on the 3x4 cylindrical lattice. For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.</p>

To do this, we apply the modern method of parametrical integration with hyperlogaritms. We discuss in detail peculiarities of application of this method to critical dynamics, e.g. the problem of linear-irreducible diagrams already present in four loop (contrary to statics where the first linear-irreducible diagram appears in six loop).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruben Hamming-Green, Ewout van der Veer, Beatriz Noheda</p>
            <p>Epitaxial strain plays a key role in determining the structure and functionality of thin films, with the choice of substrate being traditionally used to control the magnitude of the applied strain. However, even in the large family of perovskite materials, this allows for only a limited, discrete set of strain states to be achieved. Here we report on an approach to controlling epitaxial strain for the growth of perovskite materials by involving a single SrTiO$_{3}$ substrate (the most available perovskite in single crystal form) and a buffer layer that consists of the solid solution Sr(Sn, Ge)$_{x}$Ti$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$, of which the lattice parameter can be tuned in a continuous fashion, from 3.880 Å up to 4.007 Å, while maintaining coherent epitaxial growth on SrTiO$_{3}$ with high quality interfaces. Using a BaTiO$_{3}$ overlayer as a model system, we show that changes to the buffer layer composition, i.e. increase of in-plane lattice parameter, change the strain state of BaTiO$_{3}$ from fully relaxed, through highly compressively strained, to an exotic state showing 'inverted' epitaxy in which the buffer layer is relaxed from the substrate but lattice matched to the overlayer.</p>

            <p>Conventional wisdom dictates that the conducting edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ family are protected by time-reversal symmetry. However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.</p>

            <p>Ferroelastic domain walls (DWs) underpin key functionalities in complex oxides. In free-standing ferroic thin films, where elastic interactions are highly thickness dependent, understanding DW behaviour across length scales and external stimuli is crucial. A thickness-dependent monopolar-to-dipolar crossover in elastic DW behaviour has been reported; however, how temperature influences this regime remains unexplored. Here, LaAlO3 thin films spanning the dipolar ($<200$ nm) and crossover (200-300 nm) regimes are investigated using in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and a machine-learning-driven image analysis approach. By tracking DW curvature and density from above $T_C$ (approximately $550,^\circ$C) to room temperature (RT), a distinct interplay between temperature and thickness is identified. In the dipolar regime, DWs are mobile and curved near $T_C$ and gradually freeze upon cooling, consistent with the well-known temperature freezing regime. In contrast, within the crossover regime, DWs are nearly static, with minimal reconfiguration through cooling and curvature an order of magnitude lower at RT. These results map the evolution of DWs across the thermally driven super-elastic to freezing regimes, revealing how thickness and temperature govern DW morphology and dynamics, and providing insight relevant for domain engineering in free-standing oxide thin films.</p>

            <p>We revisit the U(1) quantum link model in a ladder geometry, finding, by finite-size scaling, that the critical exponent $\nu=1$ and the central charge $c=1/2$ are consistent with the Ising universality class for all phase transitions observed. A blind application of the Harris criterion would suggest that this criticality is lost in the presence of the disorder. It turns out not to be the case. For the disorder affecting ladder's rung hoppings only, we have found that the transitions survive disappearing only for quite strong disorder. The disorder in the ladder's legs destroys the nonzero mass phase criticality, while the symmetry-protected topological phase for zero mass survives a small disorder. The observed robustness against disorder is explained qualitatively using field-theoretic arguments.</p>

            <p>Wide band gap materials are particularly relevant at high temperatures. The band gap shrinkage at higher temperatures prevents device applications with narrow band gap semiconductors. Considering $\alpha$-phase strontium cyanurate as a prototype structure, we identify a group of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that exhibit ultra-wide band gaps ranging from 5.5 to 5.7 eV. Recently, a strontium cyanurate compound was found to undergo a phase transition from a high-symmetry $\beta$-phase to a low-symmetry ferroelectric $\alpha$-phase when the temperature was reduced. In the present study, utilizing group theory techniques, we unravel that a zone-center $\Gamma_2^-$ phonon mode modifies our structures from high-symmetry $\beta$-phase to a low-symmetry $\alpha$-phase for A$_3$(O$_3$C$_3$N$_3$)$_2$ MOFs with A = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. We implement first-principles calculations to investigate structural, ferroelectric, and optical properties of these compounds in $\alpha$-phase. The switching barriers between bistable polar states are also estimated. Further, to realize their feasibility, we examine the dynamical and thermal stabilities for all of these MOFs.</p>

            <p>In this comprehensive study, we present results of bulk measurements (magnetization, specific heat, ac susceptibility, thermal expansion, and magnetostriction) combined with local methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (^23Na NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) and simulations (McPhase) on polycrystalline and single-crystalline NaGdS_2 samples. The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yeimer Zambrano, Aleksey Alekseev, Konrad J. Kapcia, Krzysztof Cichy, Agnieszka Cichy</p>
            <p>We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.</p>

Comparison with extended searches that include structures from binary systems of more remote atoms in the periodic table demonstrate the relative efficiency of near neighbor screening.

            <p>While 2D materials have enormous potential for future device technologies, many challenges must be overcome before they can be deployed at an industrial scale. One of these challenges is identifying the right semiconductor/insulator combination that ensures high performance, stability, and reliability. In contrast to conventional 2D interfaces, which suffer from van der Waals gaps or covalent bonding issues, zippered structures such as the high-mobility 2D semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and its native high-$\kappa$ oxide Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ offer high-quality interfaces, good scalability, and excellent device performance. While most prior work has focused mainly on basic device behavior, here we also thoroughly assess the stability and reliability of this material system using a multiscale approach that integrates electrical characterization, density functional theory, and TCAD simulations, linking atomistic states to device-scale reliability. By analyzing four transistor design generations (top-gated, fin, and two gate-all-around FETs), we provide realistic predictions for how this system performs at the ultimate scaling limit. We identify oxygen-related defects in the oxide as the main contributors to hysteresis and recoverable threshold shifts, and we propose mitigation strategies through encapsulation or oxygen-rich annealing. Benchmarking the extracted material parameters against IRDS 2037 requirements, we demonstrate that Bi$_2$O$_2$Se/Bi$_2$SeO$_5$ transistors can achieve high drain and low gate currents at ultra-scaled conditions. These findings position this material system as a technologically credible and manufacturing-relevant pathway for future nanoelectronics.</p>

            <p>Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated data extraction and property prediction across materials science, yet their use in superconductivity research remains limited. Here we construct a large experimental database of 78,203 records, covering 19,058 unique compositions, extracted from scientific literature using an LLM-driven workflow. Each entry includes chemical composition, critical temperature, measurement pressure, structural descriptors, and critical fields. We fine-tune several open-source LLMs for three tasks: (i) classifying superconductors vs. non-superconductors, (ii) predicting the superconducting transition temperature directly from composition or structure-informed inputs, and (iii) inverse design of candidate compositions conditioned on target Tc. The fine-tuned LLMs achieve performance comparable to traditional feature-based models and in some cases exceed them, while substantially outperforming their base versions and capturing meaningful chemical and structural trends. The inverse-design model generates chemically plausible compositions, including 28% novel candidates not seen in training. Finally, applying the trained predictors to the GNoME database identifies unreported materials with predicted Tc > 10 K. Although unverified, these candidates illustrate how integrating an LLM-driven workflow can enable scalable hypothesis generation for superconductivity discovery.</p>

            <h2>Brightening of dark trions in monolayer WS$_2$ via localization of surface plasmons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreyan Raha, Tara Shankar Bhattacharya, Indrani Bose, Achintya Singha</p>
            <p>Optically inactive dark trions in two-dimensional semiconductors are poised to play a stellar role in future quantum technologies due to their long lifetimes, about two orders of magnitude greater than those of their bright counterparts. In monolayer (ML) tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$), accessing these states via optical activation remains challenging, specially at elevated temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the brightening of dark trions from ML WS$_2$ in the temperature range, 83 K-115 K, via localized surface plasmon modes in a disordered gold substrate. The resulting photoluminescence (PL) spectrum reveals a distinct spectral doublet with the twin peaks separated by ~ 45 meV. We propose that the peaks represent semi-dark and bright trion states, the origin of which lies in intervalley electron-electron scatterings. We also report on the experimental evidence of a negative degree of circular polarization in ML WS$_2$ at the energy of the semi-dark trion state.</p>

            <p>Open-shell nanographenes provide a versatile platform to host unconventional magnetic states within their {\pi}-conjugated networks. Particularly appealing are graphene architectures that incorporate spatially separated radicals and tunable interactions, offering a scalable route toward spin-based quantum architectures. Triangulenes are ideal for this purpose, as their radical count scales with size, although strong hybridization prevents individual spin control. Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window. Consequently, the initial single-radical doublet reorganizes into a frustrated triradical with weakly coupled edge spins, a molecular analog of a three-qubit quantum register.</p>

            <h2>Disorder mediated fully compensated ferrimagnetic spin-gapless semiconducting behaviour in Cr3Al Heusler alloy</h2>

            <p>Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) that simultaneously host fully compensated ferrimagnetism are highly sought for energy-efficient and stray-field-free spintronic technologies, yet their realization in chemically disordered systems has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the binary Heusler alloy Cr3Al despite adopting a fully A2-disordered structure exhibits a rare coexistence of SGS transport and a fully compensated ferrimagnetic (FCF) ground state. Single-crystalline and polycrystalline Cr3Al samples were synthesized, and comprehensive structural analyses using single crystal XRD, synchrotron powder XRD, and neutron powder diffraction reveal complete Cr/Al site mixing. Remarkably, this chemical disorder does not disrupt magnetic order; instead, magnetization, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and temperature-dependent neutron diffraction establish a robust compensated ferrimagnetic state with a vanishingly small ordered moment of 0.1(1) muB/f.u and a high Curie temperature of 773(2) K. Electrical and thermal transport measurements uncover clear SGS characteristics, including weak temperature-dependent conductivity, very low Seebeck coefficients, and electron-hole compensated transport. Hall measurements show unusual temperature-dependent carrier concentrations consistent with disorder-modified electronic states. First-principles calculations on an A2-disordered SQS structure reproduce the experimentally observed negligibly small magnetization (0.0072 muB/f.u) and reveal a vanishing spin-up band gap unambiguously supporting SGS behavior driven by chemical disorder. Our results identify Cr3Al as the first experimentally verified A2-disordered Heusler alloy exhibiting both fully compensated ferrimagnetism and spin-gapless semiconducting transport, positioning it as a robust and disorder-tolerant platform for next-generation, high-temperature spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heiko Georg Menzler, Suman Mondal, Fabian Heidrich-Meisner</p>
            <p>We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.</p>

            <p>Bilayer graphene (BLG) cavities, where electrons are confined in finite graphene flakes, provide a suitable platform to study quantum chaotic phenomena in condensed matter systems due to the trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.</p>

            <p>Germanium magnesium-telluroborate glasses with the composition 78B2O3-10GeO2-5TeO2-7-x MgO-xTm2O3, x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mol% were fabricated by using the melt quenching process. With the increase of Tm2O3 concentration, the density values increase from 3.574 to 4.153 this http URL-1, while the molar volume values decrease from 21.145 to 19.445 cm3/mol. Fourier transform infrared analysis supports the existence and conversion of BO3 and BO4. The conversion of BO3 to BO4 would lead to greater bridging oxygens BOs, influencing and reinforcing the glass network. The optical features were studied. The optical band gap decreased by increasing Tm2O3 content in the glass formula, while the index of refraction increased. The parameters take the values between 3.16 eV and 2.31 eV. Other optical and physical constants were determined like optical conductivity, electronegativity, metallization, reflection loss, steepness parameters, and transmission coefficient. Judd-Ofelt theory is used to estimate the optical intensities and line strengths of the present glasses. Radiative lifetimes and branching ratios are evaluated of different manifolds belonging to Tm3+ doped present glasses. The results showed the possibility of potential applications for these materials in the fields of laser development, Light-emitting diodes (LEDs), optical amplification and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sk Asrap Murshed, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Electronic bands in chirally stacked $n$ layer carbon-based honeycomb heterostructures, encompassing rhombohedral ($n \geq 3$), Bernal bilayer ($n=2$), and monolayer ($n=1$) graphene, possess four-fold valley and spin degeneracy. Such systems with $n \geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed.</p>

Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naga Dileep Varikuti, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke</p>
            <p>Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.</p>

            <p>Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dmytro O. Plutenko, Mikhail V. Vasnetsov</p>
            <p>The generation of white optical vortices is currently constrained by intrinsic trade-offs between spectral bandwidth, conversion efficiency, and temporal pulse integrity in conventional diffractive and geometric-phase approaches. In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth. This establishes the compensated tandem TN cell as a superior and versatile platform for high-fidelity white-light singular optics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koen Schouten, Mikhail Isachenkov</p>
            <p>The double-scaling limit of the SYK (DSSYK) model is known to possess an underlying $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ quantum group symmetry. In this paper, we provide, for the first time, a von Neumann algebraic quantum group-theoretical description of the degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the DSSYK model. In particular, we construct the operator-algebraic quantum Gauss decomposition for the von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e. the $q$-deformation of the normaliser of $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and derive the Casimir action on its quantum homogeneous spaces. We then show that the dynamics on quantum AdS$_{2,q}$ space reduces to that of the DSSYK model. Furthermore, we argue that the extension of the global symmetry group to its normaliser is not only necessary for a consistent definition of the locally compact quantum group, but that, moreover, the reduction to the DSSYK model works exclusively at the level of the normaliser. The von Neumann algebraic description is shown to give a natural restriction on the allowed quantised coordinates, elegantly ensuring length positivity and non-negative integer chord numbers. Lastly, we make remarks on the correlation function related to the strange series representation, which is argued to interpolate between the AdS and dS regions of our $q$-homogeneous space.</p>

            <p>In this short note, we review a recently developed method for analysing multi-component driven diffusive systems with open boundaries. The approach generalises the extremal-current principle known for single-component models and is based on solving the Riemann problem for the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. As a case study, we focus on a two-species exclusion process on a lattice (Two-TASEP), where two types of particles move in opposite directions with two arbitrary rates and exchange positions upon encounter with a third rate. Despite its simplicity, this toy model effectively captures the key features of multi-species driven diffusive systems, including phase separation phenomena. This allows us to illustrate the critical role played by the underlying Riemann invariants in determining the system's macroscopic behavior.</p>

            <p>We develop a novel framework to engineer persistent oscillatory modes in Markovian open quantum systems governed by a time-independent Lindblad master equation. We show that oscillatory modes can be created when the Hamiltonian and jump operator can be expressed in the same block-diagonal form. A key feature of the framework is that the dissipator of the Lindblad master equation are generally non-zero. We identify the weak and strong conditions, where the onset of the oscillatory modes is dependent and independent of the parameters of the system, respectively. Our method extends beyond the typical decoherence-free subspace approach, in which the dissipator is zero. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework using various models, showing how carefully tailored system-environment interactions can produce sustained coherent oscillations.</p>

            <p>Localization of a macroscopic number of eigenstates on a real-space boundary, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, is one of the striking topological features emerging from non-Hermiticity. Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear. Our approach offers a new route to realizing skin effects in continuous, non-periodic systems and exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity, topology, and nonlinearity in macroscopic quantum states.</p>

            <p>The search for exotic temporal orders in quantum matter, such as discrete quasi-time crystals (DQTCs), has become an important theme in nonequilibrium physics. However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases. This discovery simplifies the requirements for generating complex temporal orders and opens a viable route towards the experimental control and manipulation of quasi-time crystalline matter.</p>

            <p>The optomagnonic coupling between magnons and optical photons is an essential component for building remote quantum networks based on magnonics. Here we show that such a coupling, manifested as the magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering, can be exploited to entangle two propagating optical fields. The protocol employs two pairs of the whispering gallery modes coupled to the same magnon mode in a YIG sphere. In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled. The entanglement can be extracted by filtering the travelling output fields centered at the Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands. Optimal conditions are identified under which strong output entanglement can be achieved.</p>

Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijay Prakash S</p>
            <p>Magnetization of a ferromagnetic substance in response to an externally applied magnetic field increases with the strength of the field. This is because at the microscopic level, magnetic moments in certain regions or domains of the substance increasingly align with the applied field, while the amount of misaligned domains decreases. The alignment of such magnetic domains with an applied magnetic field forms the physical basis for the nonlinearity of magnetization. In this paper, the nonlinear function is approximated as a combination of continued fraction of straight lines. The resulting fit is used to interpret the nonlinear behavior in both growing and shrinking magnetic domains. The continued fraction of straight lines used here is an algebraic expression which can be used to estimate parameters using nonlinear regression.</p>

            <p>In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.</p>

            <p>This work develops tools to understand how quantum information spreads, scrambles, and is reshaped by measurements in many-body systems. First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling.

            <h2>Event-sparse stack denoising for 4D-STEM applications</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gregory Nordahl, Rebekka Klemmt, Espen Drath Bøjesen</p>
            <p>We introduce a denoising method for four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) that relies on processing local, scan position-independent electron event-sparse data stacks, called event-sparse stack denoising. This method adds an extra time dimension during data collection by recording multiple electron event-sparse diffraction patterns. The resulting datasets are effectively five-dimensional, referred to as locally time-resolved STEM (LTR-STEM). Diffraction data stacks at each scan position are processed using one of two sparsity denoising pipelines: 1) the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm followed by multi-step persistence thresholding, or 2) sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA), followed by single-step thresholding. Both methods perform well for diffraction data denoising, as shown by simulated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) curves, denoised experimental data for virtual imaging, and application-specific denoising for defect detection. PSNR analysis indicates that sparsity-denoised 4D-STEM data reaches the same PSNR as raw data at approximately 16% of the exposure time, demonstrating comparable image quality with a lower dose. In defect detection, a 4.1x increase in sensitivity to relative radial disk shift is observed in the denoised data. Moreover, the LTR-STEM technique may be used to inspect material degradation by tracking changes in diffraction disk intensity, allowing for critical dose estimation and exposure-selective imaging.</p>

            <h2>Efficient simulation of low-entanglement bosonic Gaussian states in polynomial time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tong Liu, Hui-Ke Jin, Tao Xiang, Hong-Hao Tu</p>
            <p>Bosonic Gaussian states appear ubiquitously in quantum optics and condensed matter physics but remain difficult to simulate classically due to the hafnian bottleneck. We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices. The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> José Halloy, Petros Chatzimpiros, François Graner, Thomas Gregor</p>
            <p>Much of today's sustainability discourse emphasizes efficiency, clean technologies, and smart systems, but largely underestimates fundamental physical constraints relating to energy-matter interactions. These constraints stem from the fact that Earth is a materially closed yet energetically open system, driven by the sustained but low power-density flux of solar radiation. This Perspective reframes sustainability within these axiomatic limits, integrating relevant timescales and orders of magnitude. We argue that fossil-fueled industrial metabolism is inherently incompatible with long-term viability, while post-fossil systems are surface-, materials-, and power-intensive. Long-term sustainability must therefore be defined not only by how much energy or material is used, but also by how it is used: favoring organic, carbon-based chemistry with limited reliance on purified metals, operating at low power density, and maintaining low throughput rates. Achieving this requires radical technological shifts toward life-compatible systems and biogeochemical circular processes, and, likely as a consequence, a paradigm change toward degrowth to a steady-state. These two shifts are mutually reinforcing and together provide the necessary foundation for any viable future.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Jougla, Nicolas Rougerie (UMPA-ENSL)</p>
            <p>We consider the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas on the 2D torus. We set temperature, chemical potential and coupling constant in a regime where classical field theory gives leading order asymptotics. In the same limit, the repulsive interaction potential is set to be short-range: it converges to a Dirac delta function with a rate depending polynomially on the other scaling parameters. We prove that the free-energy of the interacting Bose gas (counted relatively to the non-interacting one) converges to the free energy of the $\Phi^4\_2$ non-linear Schr{ö}dinger-Gibbs measure, thereby revisiting recent results and streamlining proofs thereof. We combine the variational method of Lewin-Nam-Rougerie to connect, with controled error, the quantum free energy to a classical Hartree-Gibbs one with smeared non-linearity. The convergence of the latter to the $\Phi^4\_2$ free energy then follows from arguments of Fr{ö}hlich-Knowles-Schlein-Sohinger. This derivation parallels recent results of Nam-Zhu-Zhu.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Surface-Induced Decoherence of NV Centers in Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jonah Nagura, Mykyta Onizhuk, Giulia Galli</p>
            <p>Nitrogen vacancy centers (NV) in proximity to diamond surfaces are promising nanoscale quantum sensors. However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Creminelli, Alessandro Longo, Borna Salehian, Ahmadullah Zahed</p>
            <p>We study the properties imposed by microcausality and positivity on the retarded two-point Green's function in a theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance. We assume invariance under time and spatial translations, so that the Green's function $G$ depends on $\omega$ and $\vec k$. We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\Im (\omega,\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(\omega,\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $\omega \cdot \Im G(\omega,\vec k) \ge 0$ for real $(\omega,\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\Im [\omega\, G(\omega,\vec k)] >0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $\epsilon(\omega,k)$ and $\mu^{-1}(\omega,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium. We verify the above properties in several examples where Lorentz invariance is broken by a background field, e.g. non-zero chemical potential, or non-zero temperature. We study subtracted dispersion relations when the assumption $G \to 0$ at infinity must be relaxed.</p>

            <h2>Partitioned Expansions for Approximate Tensor Network Contractions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glen Evenbly, Johnnie Gray, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan</p>
            <p>We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.</p>

            <p>A non-Hermitian generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by a periodic external potential is investigated, and its topological features are explored. We find that the bi-orthonormal geometric phase acts as a topological index, well capturing the presence/absence of the zero modes. The model is observed to display trivial and non-trivial insulator phases and a topologically non-trivial M${ö}$bius metallic phase. The driving field amplitude is shown to be a control parameter causing topological phase transitions in this model. While the system displays zero modes in the metallic phase apart from the non-trivial insulator phase, the metallic zero modes are not robust, as the ones found in the insulating phase. We further find that zero modes' energy converges slowly to zero as a function of the number of dimers in the M${ö}$bius metallic phase compared to the non-trivial insulating phase.</p>

            <p>Permanent magnets draw their properties from a complex interplay of chemical composition and phase, each with their associated intrinsic magnetic properties. Gaining an understanding of these interactions is the key to deciphering the origins of a permanent magnets' magnetic performance and facilitate the engineering of much improved-performing magnets. Here, we use advanced multiscale microscopy and microanalysis on a bulk Sm2(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)17 pinning-type high-performance magnet with outstanding thermal and chemical stability. Comparison of the microstructure in regions of different composition, we demonstrate that the pinning of magnetic domains, imaged by nanoscale magnetic induction mapping, is controlled by the composition and atomic arrangement of copper. This is confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Contrary to the belief that grain boundaries are "weak links" in magnetic materials, we demonstrate grain boundaries undergo magnetization reversal at relatively low fields (0.1-0.3 T), but this remains confined to these regions and does not significantly impact the magnet's coercivity. Our results showcase that it is the optimal microstructure within the grain itself that is crucial for achieving the desired magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>Quantum vortices are commonly described as funnel-like objects around which the superfluid swirls, and their motion is typically modeled in terms of massless particles. Here we show that in Fermi superfluids the normal component confined in the vortex core provides the vortex with a finite inertial mass. This inertia imparts an unambiguous signature to the dynamic behavior of vortices, specifically manifesting as small-amplitude transverse oscillations which remarkably follow the prediction of a simple point-like model supplemented by an effective mass. We demonstrate this phenomenon through large-scale time-dependent simulations of Fermi superfluids across a wide range of interaction parameters, at both zero and finite temperatures, and for various initial conditions. Our findings pave the way for the exploration of inertial effects in superfluid vortex dynamics.</p>

            <p>Charge transport in porous electrodes is foundational for modern energy storage technologies like supercapacitors, fuel cells, and batteries. Supercapacitors in particular rely solely on storing energy in charged pores. Here, we simulate the charging of a single electrolyte-filled pore using the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. We find that electroconvection can substantially speed up the charging dynamics. We uncover the fundamental mechanism of electroconvection during pore charging through an analytical model that predicts the induced flow field and the electric current arising due to convection. Our findings suggest that convection is especially important in the limit of slender pores with thin electric double layers, and becomes significant beyond a certain threshold voltage that is an inherent electrolyte property.</p>

            <p>Designing materials with targeted lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) demands electronic-level insight into chemical bonding. We introduce two bonding descriptors, namely normalized negative integrated crystal orbital Hamilton populations (-ICOHP) and normalized integrated crystal orbital bond index (ICOBI), that strongly correlate with LTC and rattling (mean-squared displacement), surpassing empirical rules and the unnormalized -ICOHP across >4,500 inorganic crystals by first-principles. We train a Crystal Attention Graph Neural Network (CATGNN) to predict these descriptors and screen ~200,000 database structures for extreme LTCs. From 367 (533) candidates with low (high) normalized -ICOHP and normalized ICOBI, first-principles validation identifies 106 dynamically stable compounds with LTC <5 W/mK (68% <2 W/mK) and 13 stable compounds with LTC >100 W/mK. The descriptors' low cost and clear physical meaning provide a rapid, reliable route to high-throughput discovery and inverse design of crystalline materials with ultralow or ultrahigh LTC for applications in thermal insulation, thermoelectrics, and electronics cooling.</p>

            <p>The nonlinear Hall effect has recently garnered significant attention as a powerful probe of Fermi surface quantum geometry in metals. While current studies mainly focus on the nonlinear Hall response driven by quasi-static electric fields of low frequencies, the extension of the response to higher frequencies is another promising frontier, which introduces quantum geometry into inter-band transitions. Here, we demonstrate that a specific nonlinear Hall response, namely the second harmonic Hall (SHH) response, can arise from inter-band transitions. We establish the quantum geometric origin of the SHH response and show that inter-band quantum geometry dominates the SHH response when driven near inter-band resonance. Crucially, we find that the inter-band SHH response in insulators exhibits strong frequecy dispersion, manifesting the breakdown of Kleinman's conjecture in nonlinear optics. This connects the SHH response to the breakdown of Kleinman's conjecture and reveals that frequency dispersive insulators generally allow the SHH response. Furthermore, we predict a giant SHH susceptibility in gated strained bilayer graphene and propose that one can apply the polarization resolved second harmonic microscopy to detect the SHH response there.</p>

            <p>Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system hosting rich phases. While the Heisenberg limit has been extensively studied, the role of spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by newly discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we construct a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Due to the strong spin-orbit coupling, the model takes the form of extended XYZ interactions on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase, strong spin-orbit coupling can stabilize peculiar "triplet" dimer phases. These "triplet" dimer phases, though fully gapped, respond immediately to magnetic fields and evolve smoothly into the fully polarized phase. We present that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ belongs to the "triplet" dimer phase, and discuss the implication of our results to a broad class of quantum magnets in general.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</p>

Dynamical scattering is crucial for describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which defines the transmission function via the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method is lacking a pure transmission function due to the entanglement of electron waves with the propagation function. To address this, we reformulate the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as the transmission matrix. This allows a direct comparison to the scattering matrix derived from Bloch waves in terms of their eigenstructures. Through theory, we demonstrate their equivalence with eigenvectors related by a two-dimensional Fourier matrix, given that the eigenvalue angles differ by modulo $2\pi n$ (integer $n$). We numerically verify our findings as well as demonstrate the application of the eigenstructure for the estimation of the mean inner potential.</p>

A time-dependent magnetic drive periodically generates voltage pulses, which in the frequency domain correspond to a comb with dozens of spectral modes. The micrometer-scale footprint and minimal dissipation inherent to superconducting systems foster the integration of our comb generator with advanced cryogenic electronics.

The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${\nu = 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${\eta_{\phi}=0.73(1)}$ and ${\eta_{\psi}=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.</p>

            <p>Spin waves propagating in magnetic materials exhibit nonlinear behavior at large amplitudes due to the competition between excitation and relaxation, providing an attractive platform for exploring nonlinear wave dynamics. In particular, spin waves with a non-zero wavenumber that carry momentum undergo nonlinear relaxation and experience wavenumber modulation in the nonlinear regime. This nonlinearity has been observed experimentally, for example in S. R. Lake et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 034010 (2022), but a quantitative comparison with theory has not yet been carried out. Here, We image nonlinear spin-wave propagation in two yttrium iron garnet thin films with distinct spin-wave decay rates using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. We obtain quantitative distributions of spin-wave amplitude and phase as a function of the excitation microwave strength. As a result, we observe a threshold in the spin-wave amplitude beyond which nonlinear effects become evident and confirm that this threshold is consistent with theoretical predictions based on four-magnon scattering for both samples. Moreover, as the amplitude of the spin waves increases, we observe modulation of the wavenumber across the field of view. We attribute this modulation primarily to a reduction in the saturation magnetization caused by incoherent spin waves generated by multi-magnon scattering. Our quantitative measurements provide a pathway for visualizing nonlinear spin-wave dynamics and are crucial for deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p>

            <p>We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates (EPRs) in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability-flow equivalence technique, we rigorously obtain an entropy production (EP) decomposition formula. We demonstrate that the EP, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem, $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)/\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(-\Sigma)=e^{\Sigma}$, which holds for the distribution $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)$ defined as the probability of observing a value $\Sigma$ of the quantity $\mathcal{R}\equiv \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}-B_\mathrm{act}$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with active fluctuations. Moreover, an integral fluctuation theorem, $\langle e^{- \mathcal{R} } \rangle = 1$, and the generalized second law of thermodynamics, $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot} \rangle \ge \langle B_\mathrm{act} \rangle$, follow directly. Our results hold under steady-state conditions and can be straightforwardly extended to arbitrary initial states. In the limiting case where active fluctuations vanish, these theorems reduce to the established results of stochastic thermodynamics. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce a deep-learning-based methodology for efficiently computing the EP, utilizing the Lévy score we propose. To illustrate the validity of our approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer composed of an active Brownian cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our work provides a unified framework for analyzing EP in active matter and offers practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behavior.</p>

This slow evolution complicates field-theoretic descriptions, as the weak long-term memory and the absence of a stationary state hinder simplifications of the memory, always leading to the worst-case scaling of computational effort with the cubic power of the simulated time. Here, we present an algorithm based on two-dimensional interpolations of Green's functions, which resolves this issue and achieves sublinear scaling of computational cost. We apply it to the quench dynamics of the spherical mixed $p$-spin model to establish the existence of a phase transition between glasses with strong and weak ergodicity breaking at a finite temperature of the initial state. By reaching times three orders of magnitude larger than previously attainable, we determine the critical exponents of this transition. Interestingly, these are continuously varying and, therefore, non-universal. While we introduce and validate the method in the context of a glassy system, it is equally applicable to any model with overdamped excitations.</p>

            <h2>Bridging the Gap Between Avalanche Relaxation and Yielding Rheology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Relmucao-Leiva, Carlos Villarroel, Gustavo Düring</p>
            <p>The yielding transition in amorphous materials, whether driven passively (simple shear) or actively, remains a fundamental open question in soft matter physics. While avalanche statistics at the critical point have been extensively studied, the emergence of the dynamic regime at yielding and the steady-state flow properties remain poorly understood. In particular, the significant variability observed in flow curves across different systems lacks a clear explanation. We determine, for the first time, the relationship between avalanche duration and size across the yielding transition, revealing how it evolves from quasistatic to dynamic flow regimes. This precise measurement is made using the Controlled Relaxation Time Model (CRTM), a new simulation framework that treats the relaxation time as a tunable parameter. CRTM reproduces known results in both limits and enables a direct analysis of the change of regime between them. Applying the model to different microscopic dynamics, we find that the existing scaling relation connecting critical exponents under flow holds for passive systems. However, active systems exhibit significant deviations, suggesting a missing ingredient in the current understanding of yielding.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Anyon Clusters in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianhui Xu, Guangyue Ji, Yuzhu Wang, Ha Quang Trung, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>In fractional quantum Hall fluids, the quasiparticle excitations are anyons with fractional charges and statistics. Effective interactions among the anyons can be induced by either model or realistic electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Without losing the generality, we investigate such phenomena for the Laughlin 1/3 and Moore-Read (MR) non-Abelian phases. Anyons display rich internal dynamics in both cases that will lead to interesting experimental consequences. In particular, bound states of two Laughlin anyons are preferred under short-range e-e interactions, leading to 2e/3 -- instead of e/3 -- effective charge carriers at low temperatures, which have been seen in several experiments. MR phases host two topologically distinct fusion channels: 1 and psi. The different effective interactions of e/4 anyons in the two sectors suggest the vanishing of the degeneracy of fusion channels when the e-e interaction is no longer its model Hamiltonian, in which case different bound states could also appear. This indicates the possibility of energetically manipulating the two types of anyons by tuning the bare e-e interactions. We point out that the results of recently developed high-resolution STM measurements will be affected by the effective anyon interactions, where anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The low-lying parts of the local density of states affected by various anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.</p>

            <h2>Efficient absolute interface energy calculations for heterostructures: Synergy between localized basis sets and surface passivation techniques</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sreejith Pallikkara Chandrasekharan, Sofia Apergi, Charles Cornet, Laurent Pedesseau</p>
            <p>Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. Here, we present a computationally efficient framework for determining interface energies by incorporating a surface passivation technique, demonstrated using pseudo H passivation with a localized basis set method and an explicit chemical potential. This framework is applied to calculate absolute interface energies and analyze the electronic properties of quasi lattice matched and lattice mismatched III and V on Si interfaces, with results compared to conventional reconstructed surface calculations. By combining localized basis sets with surface passivation techniques, this framework allows for accurate estimation of absolute interface energies in heterogeneous material systems. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory, and moreover offers considerable potential for calculating interface energies across diverse material systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamic theory of wetting by active particles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah Grodzinski, Michael E. Cates, Robert L. Jack</p>
            <p>The accumulation of self-propelled particles on repulsive barriers is a widely observed feature in active matter. Despite being implicated in a broad range of biological processes, from biofilm formation to cytoskeletal movement, wetting of surfaces by active particles remains poorly understood. In this work, we study this active wetting by considering a model comprising an active lattice gas, interacting with a permeable barrier under periodic boundary conditions, for which an exact hydrodynamic description is possible. We consider a hydrodynamic scaling limit that eliminates dynamical noise while retaining microscopic interpretability, enabling a precise characterisation of steady-states and their transitions. We demonstrate that the accumulation of active particles has remarkable similarities to equilibrium wetting, and that active wetting transitions display all the salient characteristics of the equilibrium critical wetting transition -- despite fundamental differences in underlying microscopic dynamics. However, our framework also enables the investigation of subtle but important nonequilibrium effects in active wetting, including a spontaneous ratchet effect which leads to a global steady-state current, departure of bulk densities from their binodal values, and a novel dynamical transition pathway. Our results provide an intrinsically nonequilibrium framework in which to study active wetting, precisely demonstrating the connection to passive wetting while clarifying the nonequilibrium consequences of activity.</p>

            <p>We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.</p>

            <h2>Jammed disks of two sizes in a channel: segregation driven by steric forces</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Liu, Michael Karbach, Gerhard Müller</p>
            <p>Disks of two sizes are confined to a long and narrow channel. The axis and the plane of the channel are horizontal. The channel is closed off by pistons that freeze jammed microstates out of loose disk configurations, agitated randomly at calibrated intensity and subject to moderate pressure. Disk sizes and channel width are such that under jamming no disks remain loose and all disks touch one wall. The protocol permits disks to move past each other prior to jamming, which facilitates randomness in the sequence of large and small disks. We present exact results for the characterization of jammed macrostates including volume and entropy for given fractions of small and large disks as functions of energy parameters which depend on the jamming protocol. Our analysis divides the disk sequence of jammed microstates into overlapping tiles out of which we construct 17 species of statistically interacting quasiparticles. Jammed macrostates then depend on the fractions of small and large disks and on a dimensionless control parameter inferred from measures for expansion work against the pistons and intensity of random agitations. Two models are introduced for comparison of key technical aspects: one model emphasizes symmetry and the other mechanical stability. We distinguish regimes for the energy parameters that either enhance or suppress mixing of disk sizes in jammed macrostates. The latter case, if realizable, is a manifestation of grain segregation driven by steric forces alone, without directional bias.</p>

            <h2>Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhou-Quan Wan, Shiwei Zhang</p>
            <p>We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.</p>

            <p>It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet (AFM) can be actively controlled. In contrast with ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode polarization is essentially fixed, AFM inertial modes can continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly polarized while its handedness reverses.</p>

            <h2>Altermagnetism and Weak Magnetism in the Insulating Distorted Perovskite Antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Suk Choi, M.-C. Jung, K.-H. Ahn, W. E. Pickett, K.-W. Lee</p>
            <p>The GdFeO$_3$-type perovskite antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$, calculated here to be altermagnetic for all three typical collinear antiferromagnetic orders, was suggested early on to be a Slater-type insulator, due in large part to its continuous metal-insulator transition and its small energy gap. Below the Néel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by a sharp change in the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\sim$1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a SOC-induced small band overlap, opening a gap similar to the experimentally observed gap of around 100 meV. Combined evidence supports the viewpoint that NaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott insulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its consequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been investigated using a combination of {\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry analysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya SOC buttressed by altermagnetic order. After determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting angle of about 3$^{\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and sharp change in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split bands (up to $\sim$100 meV) are accompanied by a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both acoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous Hall conductivity upon hole doping.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets present a class of fully compensated collinear magnetic order, where the two sublattices are not related merely by time-reversal combined with lattice translation or inversion, but require an additional lattice rotation. This distinctive symmetry leads to a characteristic splitting of the magnon bands; however the splitting is only partial -- residual degeneracies persist along certain lines in the Brillouin zone as a consequence of the underlying altermagnetic rotation. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic spin model on the checkerboard lattice and introduce additional interactions such as an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, that lift these degeneracies. The resulting magnon bands become fully gapped and acquire non-trivial topology, characterized by nonzero Chern numbers. We demonstrate the crucial role of altermagnetism for the generation of the Berry curvature. As a direct consequence of the topological magnons, we find finite thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$, which exhibits a characteristic low-temperature scaling, $\kappa_{xy}\propto T^4$. Moreover, $\kappa_{xy}$ changes sign under reversal of the magnetic field, exhibiting a sharp jump across zero field at low temperatures. We also demonstrate topologically protected chiral edge modes in a finite strip geometry.</p>

            <h2>Correlation effects in one-dimensional metallic quantum wires under various confinements</h2>

            <p>Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $\epsilon_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - \pi^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\epsilon_{\rm c} \sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.</p>

By modeling hysteron dynamics as a gradient system, we show how to construct hysteron transition graphs by characterizing the fold bifurcations of the dynamical system. Transition graphs represent the sequence of hysterons switching states, providing critical insights into the collective behavior of driven disordered media. Extending this analysis to higher codimension bifurcations, such as cusp bifurcations and crossings of fold curves, allows us to map out how the topology of transition graphs changes with variations in system parameters. This approach can suggest strategies for designing metamaterials capable of encoding targeted memory and computational functionalities, but it also highlights the rapid increase of design complexity with system size, further underscoring the computational challenges of controlling large hysteretic systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal superconductivity(SC) occurs at a moderate imbalance. Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. In addition, the SC can be possibly hosted by a single layer, which is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</p>

            <p>We present a symmetry-based framework for the analysis of excitonic states, incorporating both time-reversal and space-group symmetries. We demonstrate the use of time-reversal and space-group symmetries to obtain exciton eigenstates at symmetry-related center-of-mass momenta in the entire Brillouin zone from eigenstates calculated for center-of-mass momenta in the irreducible Brillouin zone. Furthermore, by explicitly calculating the irreducible representations of the little groups, we classify excitons according to their symmetry properties across the Brillouin zone. Using projection operators, we construct symmetry-adapted linear combinations of electron-hole product states, which block diagonalize the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) Hamiltonian at both zero and finite exciton center-of-mass momenta. This enables a transparent organization of excitonic states and provides direct access to their degeneracies, selection rules, and symmetry-protected features. As a demonstration, we apply this formalism to monolayer MoS$_2$, where the classification of excitonic irreducible representations and the block structure of the BSE Hamiltonian show excellent agreement with compatibility relations derived from group theory. Beyond this material-specific example, the framework offers a general and conceptually rigorous approach to the symmetry classification of excitons, enabling significant reductions in computational cost for optical spectra, exciton-phonon interactions, and excitonic band structure calculations across a wide range of materials.</p>

            <p>The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</p>

The spectra show a nearly flat band with pinch-point-like momentum dependence, accompanied by dispersive branches that generate half-moon features across multiple Brillouin zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario.

            <p>The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.</p>

            <p>Periodically driven systems provide unique opportunities to investigate the dynamics of topological excitations far from equilibrium. In this paper, we report a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\phi^4$ model. This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational symmetry while simultaneously displaying spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined despite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged annihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation.</p>

            <p>A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.</p>

            <p>Laser-generated surface acoustic waves (SAW) facilitate an efficient information processing in modern spintronics and magnonics. The ability to tune SAW parameters is crucial to achieve an acoustic control over magnonic properties. Such tunability can be achieved in phase-changing magnetic materials accommodating both spin waves and SAWs. A promising material is FeRh alloy, a metallic antiferromagnet at room temperature undergoing a phase transition into ferromagnetic state accompanied by a crystal lattice expansion at 370 K. This transition can also be induced by femtosecond laser pulses. In this paper we use the phase transition in 60 nm Fe49Rh51 film to optically generate pulses of Gigahertz quasi-Rayleigh SAWs. We detect them via photoelastic effect and show that the lattice transformation during phase transition is a dominant strain-generation mechanism for above-threshold excitation. The weight of this contribution rises as the sample is heated closer to AFM-FM transition temperature and 'switches off' when heated above it allowing to control the SAW amplitude. A model based on thermodynamical parameters of Fe49Rh51 shows that the lattice transformation occurring within 95 ps effectively contributes to SAW generation happening at a comparable timescale, while non-equilibrium fast kinetics of the phase transition does not.</p>

            <h2>Spatial and Temporal Cluster Tomography of Active Matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leone V. Luzzatto, Mathias Casiulis, Stefano Martiniani, István A. Kovács</p>
            <p>Critical phase transitions have proven to be a powerful concept to capture the phenomenology of many systems, including deeply non-equilibrium ones like living systems. The study of these phase transitions has overwhelmingly relied on two-point correlation functions. In this Letter, we show that cluster tomography -- the study of one-dimensional cross-sections of the clusters that emerge near a phase transition -- is an alternative higher-order tool that efficiently locates and characterizes phase transitions in active systems. First, using motility-induced phase separation as a paradigmatic example, we show how complex geometric features of clusters, captured by spatial cluster tomography, can be used to measure critical exponents in active systems without explicitly introducing system-specific order parameters. Second, we introduce temporal cluster tomography, an analogous cluster-based measurement that characterizes the dynamical behavior of active systems. We show that cluster dynamics can be captured by a generalization of burstiness analysis in complex temporal networks. Both spatial and temporal cluster tomography are easy to implement yet powerful approaches to study non-equilibrium systems, making them useful additions to the standard toolbox of statistical physics.</p>

            <h2>On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Parejo, Andrés Santos</p>
            <p>We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed, and enables quantitative assessment of quantum effects in noble gases such as helium, neon, and argon. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the synthesis and luminescence behavior of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ nanoparticles with varying $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ content. The materials were prepared via a wet chemical route and thermally annealed to improve crystallinity and reduce defects. Phase composition and structural parameters were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity mapping was used to evaluate emission uniformity and monitor the degradation of luminescence under electron beam exposure. Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectroscopy confirmed energy transfer from $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ to $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ ions. Luminescence intensities were found to depend strongly on both Ce content and thermal treatment. The results contribute to the understanding of defect-related quenching mechanisms and are relevant for the design of rare-earth-based luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications.</p>

            <p>Many biological, culinary, and engineering processes lead to the co-encapsulation of several soft particles within a liquid interface. In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.</p>

            <p>Lattice-matched GaP layers can be grown on Si(001) substrate via a two-step growth procedure, consisting of low-temperature nucleation followed by high-temperature overgrowth. Previous time-resolved spectroscopic studies on a thin GaP nucleation layer discovered a discrete electronic state and a phonon mode at 2 THz, both localized at the heterointerface and enhanced resonantly at pump photon energy of 1.4 eV. Here we investigate the influence of the high-temperature overgrowth on the interface electronic state and the 2-THz phonon mode. We find that the 1.4-eV resonances in the electronic transition and in the phonon amplitude vanish after the overgrowth, although the 2-THz phonon mode is still detected. Furthermore, the optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude after the overgrowth is qualitatively different from that before the overgrowth. Our observations imply that the 2-THz phonon mode itself is robust against the high-temperature overgrowth. The phonon amplitude is defined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition, however, the latter of which is more sensitively affected by the overgrowth. We propose that the drastic changes in the electronic transition is triggered by the formation of pyramidal nano-facets at the GaP/Si interface.</p>

            <h2>Universal Critical Scaling and Phase Diagram of the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect under Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Tozar</p>
            <p>Standard scaling theory dictates that disorder leads to immediate localization in one-dimensional Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology fundamentally alters this paradigm, protecting transport up to a substantial critical disorder strength. By employing a numerically stable log-space transfer matrix approach up to thermodynamic scales (N=1000), we identify a sharp phase transition from the topological skin phase to the Anderson localized phase. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that this transition belongs to a unique universality class with critical exponents \nu\approx1.50 and \beta\approx0.65. Furthermore, we map the global phase diagram, confirming that the critical disorder scales as W_c\propto\sqrt\gamma, consistent with localization suppression by an imaginary vector potential. Our results establish the rigorous limits of non-Hermitian topological protection in imperfect media.</p>

            <h2>Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Tozar</p>
            <p>We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.</p>

            <p>We study a one-dimensional gas of $N$ Brownian particles that diffuse independently but are simultaneously reset whenever any of them reaches a fixed threshold located at $L > 0$. For any $N > 2$, the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) at long-times with strong long-range correlations. These correlations emerge purely from the dynamics, and not from built-in interactions. Despite being strongly correlated, the NESS has a solvable structure that allows for an exact computation of several physical observables, both global and local. These include the average density profile, the distribution of the position of the $k$-th ordered particles, the distribution of the gap between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval around the origin.</p>

            <h2>Higgs physics in superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chu, Haotian Zhang, Zhili Zhang</p>
            <p>As pointed out by Nambu&Goldstone, continuous symmetry breaking gives rise to gapless bosonic excitation. In superconductors, continuous local U(1) gauge symmetry is broken. The gapless excitation thus created is the collective phase mode of a superconductor. In 1962, Anderson pointed out that Coulomb interaction lifts this gapless mode to the superconducting plasma frequency. Therefore, in a superconducting fluid there are no bosonic excitations below the Cooper pair binding energy. Anderson mechanism also implies that the massless photon becomes massive in a superconductor. It provides a microscopic theory for dissipationless charge transport (with Landau criterion for superfluidity) and the Meissner effect in a superconductor. Jumping to particle physics, to explain why the gauge bosons for electroweak interaction are massive, Higgs, Englert, Kibble et al. proposed the existence of the Higgs field. This matter field couples to the massless W, Z bosons and generates mass via the Higgs mechanism. Due to their conceptual similarities, these two mechanisms are referred to as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. In 2013, the detection of the Higgs boson provided the final proof for the Higgs hypothesis decades after its conception. The amplitude mode of a superconductor, which corresponds to the Higgs boson in the above analogy, is referred to as the Higgs mode. Its spectroscopic detection has also remained elusive for decades. In recent years, the development of ultrafast techniques enabled an effective approach for studying the mode. Here, we introduce the Higgs mode from a perspective of why superconductors superconduct and review the recent development in Higgs spectroscopy, particularly in the field of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. We discuss the novel insights that may be learnt from these studies for future high-Tc superconductivity and correlated materials research in general.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the spin structure and spin dynamics of excitons in bulk lead halide perovskite semiconductors with cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic crystal symmetry. The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals. Polarization beats at the frequency of the bright exciton are observed in both configurations. Comparison with theory indicates that the excitons are in the strong exchange interaction regime, and the reduction of symmetry does not lead to a significant splitting of the exciton spin levels.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Breakdown of Anderson Localization: Thermodynamic Segregation disguised as the Skin Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali Tozar</p>
            <p>We investigate the interplay between strong disorder and repulsive interactions in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model under open boundary conditions. While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver. This "interaction-induced segregation" manifests as a sharp thermodynamic crossover, characterized by a divergent energy susceptibility, challenging the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Our study unveils the precise role of the underlying potential in regulating the fundamental processes of dynamic hysteresis, which manifests in numerous natural and designed systems. We identify that it is possible to induce symmetry breaking in dynamic hysteresis, and consequently to observe dynamic transitions under moderate conditions, which is absent for the symmetric case, if appropriate asymmetry is implemented in the design of the underlying potential. This kind of asymmetry appears through the disparate widths of the two wells of the intrinsic bistable potential governing the dynamics and the barrier separating them. It is characteristically distinct from the potential in which the two minima are energetically dissimilar. Our understanding suggests that only the intrinsic asymmetry of the former type can substantially influence the elemental dynamics of the processes to generate significant effects on the outcomes. Our study presents a novel approach to quantitatively regulate the outputs, to increase or decrease the extent of dynamic hysteresis, based on the requirements, by effectively controlling the proper asymmetry of the intrinsic potential.</p>

The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities.</p>

Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincaré-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--Hückel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</p>

            <p>Zero energy states in one dimensional SSH Kitaev hybrid systems have emerged as promising candidates for topological qubits. In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.</p>

By using the uniaxial dispersion model, we characterized the form-birefringence properties, which can enable the phase matching condition in waveguides or other nonlinear optical applications.

            <p>The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties. In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of supply chain during production.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ken Ishihara, Hideaki Shimazaki</p>
            <p>Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome this limitation, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for nonstationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization through dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting more efficient computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.</p>

            <h2>Nonstabilizerness dynamics in many-body localized systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski, Emanuele Tirrito</p>
            <p>Nonstabilizerness, also known as ``magic'', quantifies the deviation of quantum states from stabilizer states, capturing the complexity necessary for quantum computational advantage. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness in disordered many-body localized (MBL) systems using the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Leveraging a phenomenological description based on the $\ell$-bit model, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that interactions profoundly influence nonstabilizerness spreading, inducing a power-law growth of SRE that markedly contrasts with the rapid saturation observed in ergodic systems. We validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of the disordered transverse-field Ising model, showing excellent agreement across various disorder strengths, system sizes, and initial states. Additionally, we uncover a universal relationship between SRE and entanglement entropy, revealing their common scaling in the MBL regime independent of disorder strength and system size. Our results offer critical insights into the interplay of disorder, interactions, and complexity in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Application-specific machine-learned interatomic potentials: exploring the trade-off between DFT convergence, MLIP expressivity, and computational cost</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ilgar Baghishov, Jan Janssen, Graeme Henkelman, Danny Perez</p>
            <p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing computational materials science and chemistry by offering an efficient alternative to {\em ab initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, fitting high-quality MLIPs remains a challenging, time-consuming, and computationally intensive task where numerous trade-offs have to be considered, e.g., How much and what kind of atomic configurations should be included in the training set? Which level of {\em ab initio} convergence should be used to generate the training set? Which loss function should be used for fitting the MLIP? Which machine learning architecture should be used to train the MLIP? The answers to these questions significantly impact both the computational cost of MLIP training and the accuracy and computational cost of subsequent MLIP MD simulations. In this study, we use a configurationally diverse beryllium dataset and quadratic spectral neighbor analysis potential. We demonstrate that joint optimization of energy versus force weights, training set selection strategies, and convergence settings of the {\em ab initio} reference simulations, as well as model complexity can lead to a significant reduction in the overall computational cost associated with training and evaluating MLIPs. This opens the door to computationally efficient generation of high-quality MLIPs for a range of applications which demand different accuracy versus training and evaluation cost trade-offs.</p>

            <h2>Geometric Regularity in Deterministic Sampling Dynamics of Diffusion-based Generative Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Defang Chen, Zhenyu Zhou, Can Wang, Siwei Lyu</p>
            <p>Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion generative models: each simulated sampling trajectory along the gradient field lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical boomerang shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing deterministic numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only 5 - 10 function evaluations.</p>

            <h2>Proof of a perfect platonic representation hypothesis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liu Ziyin, Isaac Chuang</p>
            <p>In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the ``perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD), two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive while avoiding jargon and lengthy technical details.</p>

            <h2>Size-Dependent Skin Effect Transitions in Weakly Coupled Non-Reciprocal Chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yixuan Li, Linhu Li, Zhihao Xu</p>
            <p>Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique boundary phenomena absent in their Hermitian counterparts, most notably the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). In this work, we explore a lattice model consisting of two coupled non-reciprocal chains, focusing on the interplay between system size, inter-chain coupling, and spectral topology. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we systematically examine the evolution of the complex energy spectra and spectral winding numbers under periodic and open boundary conditions. Our results uncover a variety of size-dependent localization transitions, including the emergence and instability of concurrent bipolar skin effects in the $W=0$ region, and their crossover to unipolar and conventional bipolar NHSE as the system size increases. Notably, we demonstrate that these size-dependent behaviors persist even beyond the weak-coupling regime, highlighting their universality in non-Hermitian systems with complex spectral structures. This study provides insights into the mechanisms governing skin effects and offers practical guidelines for engineering non-Hermitian topological phases in synthetic lattices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vinícius B. Müller, Fernando L. Metz</p>
            <p>We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a systematic characterization of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks within the quenched mean-field approximation.</p>

For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</p>

Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</p>

We identify a flux sweet spot where the dispersive shift vanishes, achieved by balancing the dispersive couplings to the internal and qubit modes.

            <h2>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Galen J. Wilkerson</p>
            <p>Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</p>

            <h2>Meta-learning three-factor plasticity rules for structured credit assignment with sparse feedback</h2>

            <p>Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Tangui Aladjidi, Tiago D. Ferreira, Alberto Bramati, Mathias Albert, Pierre-Élie Larré, Quentin Glorieux</p>
            <p>A superfluid flows without friction below a critical velocity, exhibiting zero drag force on impurities. Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity. Our findings establish a fundamental link between internal-energy dissipation in quantum fluids and concepts of self-propulsion in active-matter systems, and opens new possibilities for exploiting vortices for controlled quantum transport at the microscale.</p>

            <p>We theoretically demonstrate a gate-tunable superconducting spin valve effect (SVE) in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure composed of a monolayer superconductor (S) sandwiched between two ferromagnetic (F) monolayers (F/S/F). By electrostatically gating the ferromagnetic layers to modulate their chemical potentials, the system can be continuously tuned between the standard, inverse and triplet (non-monotonic) SVE regimes within the same device. This tunability originates from the gate-controlled hybridization between the superconducting and ferromagnetic electronic spectra, which determines the effective exchange field induced in the S-layer. Furthermore, we reveal that gating enables exotic, non-BCS temperature dependencies of the superconducting order parameter, including reentrant superconductivity, bistable states, first-order phase transitions, and the emergence of superconductivity at finite temperatures. Our results establish vdW F/S/F trilayers as a versatile and highly controllable platform for superconducting spintronics, where external gate voltages can selectively activate different spin-valve functionalities and unconventional superconducting states.</p>

            <p>Magnetic skyrmions, renowned for their fascinating electromagnetic properties, hold potential for next-generation topological spintronic devices. Recent advancements have unveiled a rich tapestry of 3D topological magnetism. Nevertheless, the practical application of 3D topological magnetism in the development of topological spintronic devices remains a challenge. Here, we showcase the experimental utilization of 3D topological magnetism through the exploitation of skyrmion-edge attractive interactions in 90-nm-wide confined chiral FeGe and CoZnMn magnetic nanostructures. These attractive interactions result in two degenerate equilibrium positions, which can be naturally interpreted as binary bits for a skyrmion sliding switch. Our theory and simulation reveal current-driven spiral motions of skyrmions, governed by the anisotropic gradient of the potential landscape. Our experiments validate the theory that predicts a tunable threshold current density via magnetic field and temperature modulation of the energy barrier.

            <p>Topological magnetic solitons have emerged as promising candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices, thanks to their fascinating electromagnetic properties. For fundamental device applications, the ability to electrically manipulate individual solitons is crucial. However, electrical manipulation of single antiskyrmions has been rarely demonstrated. In this work, we present current-controlled manipulations, encompassing the creation, deletion, and topological transformation of a single antiskyrmion within FeNiPdP nanostructured cells at room temperature. This nanostructure is uniquely designed with dimensions of about 400 nm in width and length, enabling the stabilization of a single antiskyrmion. By simply adjusting the density of nanosecond single-pulsed currents, we achieve the reversible creation and deletion of single antiskyrmions. Moreover, we uncover a rich variety of current-controlled topological transformations among individual antiskyrmions, skyrmions, bubbles, and ferromagnetic states. Our experimental findings are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, highlighting the pivotal role of current-induced combined effects, such as spin transfer torque and Joule heating.

            <p>Thin, metallic magnetic films can support nonreciprocal spin waves due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). However, these films typically have high damping, making spin wave propagation distances short (less than one micrometer). In this work, we theoretically study a thin ferromagnetic strip with iDMI and excite spin waves by driving a central segment of the strip. Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called "overlap function" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers. Moreover, to circumvent the issue of short propagation distances, we propose a geometry where iDMI is only present in the driving region and low-damping materials comprise the remainder of the strip. Our calculations show significant spin wave amplitudes over several microns from the excitation region.</p>

Here, we demonstrate precise control of ferromagnetism in a SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin film, where a high density of states (DOS), arising from low-dimensional quantum states, places the system at the crossover between a non-magnetic and bulk ferromagnetic state. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES/ARPES), transport measurements, and theoretical calculations, we systematically tune the Fermi level via electron doping across the high-DOS point. We directly visualize the spin-split band structure and reveal its influence on both magnetic and transport properties. Our findings provide compelling evidence that magnetism can be engineered through DOS control at a phase crossover, establishing a pathway for the rational design of tunable quantum materials.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets have attracted tremendous interest for revealing intriguing physics and promising spintronics applications. In contrast to conventional antiferromagnets, altermagnets break both PT and Tt symmetries, and simultaneously exhibit spin-split band structures with a vanishing net magnetization. To quantify insulating altermagnets without conduction electron, we propose to use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) to identify the altermagnetic fingerprints. In particular, we demonstrate not only the giant MOKE responses, but also their connection with the orientations of Neel vectors at room temperature in altermagnet hematite alpha-Fe_2O_3. Specifically, under the Neel vector along the [1-100] axis, we find a giant polar Kerr rotation angle 93.4 mdeg in the (11-20) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2'/c'. Under the Neel vector along the [11-20] axis, we find a longitudinal Kerr angle 9.6 mdeg in the (0001) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2/c. Further, we show that such pronounced MOKE effects directly enable an optical imaging of altermagnetic domains, together with their reversible domain wall (DW) motion. Our studies not only suggest MOKE can be used to identify altermagnet candidates, but also signify the feasibility of exploring altermagnetic optical and DW spintronics, which could largely expand the current research paradigm of altermagnetism.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke</p>
            <p>This study establishes a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings. We integrate analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and \textit{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments to demonstrate that externally applied strain is a powerful stimuli for manipulating three-dimensional magnetic skyrmion strings. Analytical models predict that strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings in bulk systems, a finding corroborated by numerical simulations. These simulations further reveal that strain drives the system from fragmented multi-domain states toward unified single-domain configurations and facilitates skyrmion string rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. The collapse of the skyrmion lattice exhibits a temperature-dependent character, shifting from first-order to second-order behavior near the critical temperature $T_c$. Reducing sample thickness significantly increases the critical strain required for annihilation due to the suppression of tilting. Experimental validation on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirms strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism in this system, over magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of strain-mediated control in three-dimensional magnetic systems, demonstrating its feasibility for energy-efficient spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Single particle dynamical signature of topology induced by single mode cavities in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Pavan, Grazia Di Bello, Giulio De Filippis, Carmine Antonio Perroni</p>
            <p>Witnessing and tracking topological phase transitions induced by interactions with the environment is a crucial challenge. Among the various experimental approaches to detect topological properties, the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) has emerged as a powerful bulk probe in one-dimensional chiral systems, allowing the extraction of the topological invariant from single-particle dynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology.</p>

            <h2>Domain Wall Control of Topological Qubits in the Kitaev SSH Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Griffith Rufo, Sabrina Rufo, Heron Caldas</p>
            <p>Zero energy states in one dimensional SSH Kitaev hybrid systems have emerged as promising candidates for topological qubits. In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.</p>

            <h2>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of $γ$-Belite(010)-Water Interfaces with High-Dimensional Neural Network Potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernadeta Prus, Jörg Behler</p>
            <p>Belite -- dicalcium silicate Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ -- is a main constituent of low-carbon cement. In this work, we study several terminations of the (010) surface of $\gamma$-belite, its most stable polymorph, by molecular dynamics simulations. The energies and forces are provided by a high-dimensional neural network potential trained to density functional theory data. Water can interact in molecular form as well as dissociatively with the investigated interfaces, and the degree of dissociation is determined primarily by the protonation of SiO$_4$ groups accessible at the surface. A major part of the simultaneously formed hydroxide ions is adsorbed at surface calcium atoms, whose octahedral coordination spheres are completed by additional water molecules. The T3 termination, which is most stable in vacuum, shows only little reactivity in water. For the only slightly less stable T2 termination, however, two distinct types of surface defects are observed. The type I defect is even stable in vacuum and leads to a reconstruction of the entire surface, while the type II defect is only found in the presence of water. Overall, our results suggest that a variety of structures may be formed at the Ca$_2$SiO$_4$(010) surface, which are stabilized in the presence of water.</p>

            <p>When a gas of particles interacts with much a larger reservoir the dynamics of density on large scales is typically governed by diffusion. We study this paradigmatic problem for weakly coupled integrable systems and show that this picture is altered when transport is investigated on top of long-lived non-thermal states. Remarkably, for states non-invariant under parity we find Burgers equation arising in the hydrodynamic limit. We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear Euler-scale coupling of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions, which we call velocity swap models. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath.</p>

            <p>We investigate the ground-state properties of ultracold two-component Fermi gases in the presence of a transverse harmonic potential, focusing on the strongly interacting regime in which pairs of fermions form tightly bound molecules. Using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, we calculate the equation of state and density profiles for the full fermionic system, which allows us to address the importance of finite-range corrections arising from the internal fermionic structure of the composite bosons. We interpret the results in terms of a molecular Bose gas in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and compare them with theoretical predictions for a weakly interacting two-dimensional Bose gas, identifying the range of validity of mean-field and beyond-mean-field descriptions. We also develop an analytical theory for the transverse density profile, capturing its broadening with increasing interaction strength. This work provides a benchmark for an effective bosonic description of strongly bound fermionic dimers and offers new insights into the three- to two-dimensional crossover.</p>

The as-grown sample S1 exhibits characteristics typical of optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals containing twins and twin boundaries. Analysis of both FLC and PG showed an unexpected improvement in all characteristics of the sample after 6 years of storage (sample S2), indicating that the effect of twin boundaries is somehow limited. After 17 years of storage, all characteristics of the sample changed dramatically, which indicates a strong influence of internal defects formed during the aging process.

            <h2>The Impact of Magnons, Defects, and Rapid Energy Migration on the Optical Properties of the 2D Magnet CrPS4</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacob T. Baillie, Eden Tzanetopoulos, Rachel T. Smith, Remi Beaulac, Daniel R. Gamelin</p>
            <p>Strong coupling between optical and magnetic excitations could enable contactless, spatially resolved, or ultrafast interrogation and control of magnetism two-dimensional (2D) materials and devices. The layered 2D A-type antiferromagnet CrPS4 stands out among van der Waals (vdW) magnets for its rich optical fine structure, but its spectroscopy is not yet understood and has so far been interpreted without consideration of magnetic exchange. Here, we show that this fine structure comes primarily from exchange-mediated coupling between on-site optical "spin-flip" transitions of Cr3+ and low-energy spin transitions involving the surrounding lattice. Well-resolved magnon sidebands to optical 4A2 <--> 2E transitions are observed in photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation spectra, as well as a pronounced PL sideband due to short-range exchange splitting. Energy migration is probed using Yb3+ dopants as traps, revealing sub-picosecond inter-site excitation hopping. Formation of dispersive Frenkel excitons of coupled on-site d-d transitions due to inter-site exchange is discussed. In addition to impacting how optical fine structure is interpreted in this and potentially other vdW magnets, these findings may have ramifications for future applications of layered 2D magnets by revealing new opportunities to drive mode-specific spin-wave excitations using light.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. A. Mojarro, Sergio E. Ulloa</p>
            <p>We study superconductivity and superfluid weight of the two-dimensional $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice with on-site asymmetries, hosting an isolated quasi-flat band with tunable bandwidth via a parameter $\alpha$. Within a mean-field approximation of the attractive Hubbard model, we obtain the superconducting order parameters on the three inequivalent sublattices and show their strong dependence on $\alpha$, interaction strength, and electron filling. At quasi-flat band filling, a superconducting gap opens and grows power-law fast with interaction strength, instead of the usual slow exponential growth, due to diverging density of states. We calculate the superfluid weight from linear response theory and study its band dispersion and geometric contributions. While the conventional part proportional to band derivatives is suppressed in the quasi-flat band regime, the contribution dominated by the quantum metric grows linearly for small interaction strength. We further demonstrate how tuning $\alpha$ enhances the quantum metric and thus the geometric superfluid weight especially near half-filling, while increasing on-site asymmetries increases the conventional contribution by broadening the quasi-flat band. We obtain the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and demonstrate its strong dependence and enhancement with the parameter $\alpha$. Our results establish a tunable flat band system, the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice model, as a candidate for tunable quantum geometry and superfluid weight and as a prototype of related behavior in tunable quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alan Kahan, Pablo Viñas, Torsten V. Zache, Alejandro Bermudez</p>
            <p>We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vighnesh Dattatraya Naik, Markus Heyl</p>
            <p>The dynamics of long-range quantum Ising models represents a current frontier in experimental physics, notably in trapped ions or Rydberg atomic systems. However, a theoretical description of these dynamics beyond 1D remains a significant challenge for conventional methods. Here, we address this challenge by means of neural quantum states to simulate global quenches from the fully polarized ferromagnetic state in the 2D quantum Ising model with power-law decaying interactions. From these numerically exact simulations, we find that the dynamics exhibit slow relaxation with long-lived oscillations. We explain this behavior through a theory for the formation of magnon bound states, which are generated, as we show, through effective attractive interactions between magnons that persist over several lattice sites due to the power-law nature of the interactions. Our results are readily observable in current quantum simulation platforms realizing long-range interacting models such as in Rydberg atomic systems.</p>

            <p>The landscape of two-dimensional photonics has been dominated by van der Waals (vdW) materials. Expanding this library to include non-vdW layered systems promises enhanced environmental robustness and access to novel functionalities, such as strong ionic conductivity, yet their exfoliation remains challenging. Here, we establish Na2Zn2TeO6 (NZTO), a P2-type superionic conductor, as an exfoliable non-vdW optical material. We demonstrate that the highly disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer inherently facilitates mechanical cleavage down to few-nanometer thicknesses (about 4 nm). Optical interrogation via spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals NZTO as a wide-bandgap dielectric with pronounced optical birefringence (Delta_n about 0.25) across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The lattice dynamics, probed by temperature-resolved Raman spectroscopy, underscore the rigidity of the [Zn2TeO6]2- framework, which remains largely decoupled from the high ionic mobility. These results identify NZTO as a compelling platform for robust, anisotropic dielectric photonics, simultaneously opening a pathway toward the convergence of ionic transport and optical control - an emerging paradigm we term iono-photonics.</p>

            <h2>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Galen J. Wilkerson</p>
            <p>Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</p>

            <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for large-scale extraction and organization of unstructured data owing to their exceptional Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. Empowering materials design, vast amounts of data from experiments and simulations are scattered across numerous scientific publications, but high-quality experimental databases are scarce. This study considers the effectiveness and practicality of five representative AI tools (ChemDataExtractor, BERT-PSIE, ChatExtract, LangChain, and Kimi) to extract bandgaps from 200 randomly selected Materials Science publications in two presentations (arXiv and publisher versions), comparing the results to those obtained by human processing. Although the integrity of data extraction has not met expectations, encouraging results have been achieved in terms of precision and the ability to eliminate irrelevant papers from human consideration. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and limitations of these tools, offering insights into improving future data extraction techniques for enhanced scientific discovery and innovation. In conjunction with recent research, we provide guidance on feasible improvements for future data extraction methodologies, helping to bridge the gap between unstructured scientific data and structured, actionable databases.</p>

Our model proves valid for SQUID screening parameters up to $\beta_\mathrm{L}<1$, hence covering the full range of practically relevant design parameters. We demonstrate that our model significantly improves agreement with experimental data compared to the existing models, thereby enabling optimization beyond the previously accessible parameter space. Moreover, our model supports non-sinusoidal current-phase relations of the rf-SQUID's Josephson junction, allowing, for the first time, for the modeling of devices based on Josephson tunnel junctions with inhomogeneous tunnel barriers. We show that the effects of such inhomogeneities are qualitatively similar to, yet distinct from, those of the screening parameter, making their inclusion essential for accurate characterization. Incorporating these effects yields great improved agreement with measurements, even at readout power conditions well beyond typical operating parameters.</p>

            <p>We propose a single auxiliary-assisted purification-based framework for quantum error correction, capable of correcting errors that drive a system from its ground-state subspace into excited-state sectors. The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle.</p>

The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Z. Zhang, Reja H. Wilke, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>There has been great interest in identifying a Kitaev quantum spin liquid state in frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions. In particular, the experimental report of a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in the presence of a magnetic field has generated excitement as it could be strong evidence for a field-induced chiral spin liquid. More recent experiments, however, provide a conflicting interpretation advocating for topological magnons in the field-polarized state as the origin of the non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity observed in their experiments. An inherent difficulty in distinguishing between the two scenarios is the phase transition between a putative two-dimensional spin liquid and the field-polarized state exists only at zero temperature, while the behaviour at finite temperature is mostly crossover phenomena. In this work, we provide insights into the finite temperature crossover behavior between the spin excitation continuum in a quantum spin liquid and topological magnons in the field-polarized state in three different theoretical models with large Kitaev interactions. These models allow for a field-induced phase transition from a spin liquid (or an intermediate field-induced spin liquid) to the field-polarized state in the quantum model. We obtain the dynamical spin structure factor as a function of magnetic field using molecular dynamics simulations and compute thermal Hall conductivity in the field-polarized regime. We demonstrate the gradual evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor exhibiting crossover behaviour near magnetic fields where zero-temperature phase transitions occur in the quantum model. We also examine nonlinear effects on topological magnons and the validity of thermal Hall conductivity computed using linear spin wave theory. We discuss the implications of our results to existing and future experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emily Z. Zhang, Ciarán Hickey, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has traditionally been one of the primary methods for investigating quantum magnets, particularly in identifying a continuum of excitations as a hallmark of spin fractionalization in quantum spin liquids (QSLs). However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $K\Gamma\Gamma'$ model, we show that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics in these frustrated systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. P. Garrido, P. A. Orellana, A. Matos-Abiague</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied. We propose exploiting the extended nature of edge-like MSs as effective interconnects enabling the coupling between topological states in adjacent planar JJs. The impact of electrostatic disorder on the MSs is also analyzed.</p>

            <p>Here, we explore the role of inherent altermagnetic topology in transverse transport phenomena (such as crystal/anomalous Hall, Nernst, and thermal Hall effects) in several famous altermagnets, including tetragonal \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O (\textit{X} = K, Rb, Cs; \textit{Y} = S, Se, Te), RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, as well as hexagonal CrSb and MnTe. Notably, in \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O, the first experimentally realized layered altermagnets, transverse transport is governed by altermagnetic pseudonodal surfaces, emphasizing the purely topological contributions to transverse transport. Interestingly, we demonstrate that strain engineering and magnetic field, two unique methods for selectively controlling crystal and anomalous transport, can substantially enhance the magnitude of these phenomena while preserving the alternating spin characteristics in both real and momentum space. Moreover, due to the spin symmetry breaking via shear strain, a new magnetic phase, fully compensated ferrimagnetism, with isotropic spin splitting, can be induced. Our findings provide effective strategies not only for manipulating transverse transport in altermagnets but also for controlling magnetic phase transitions, offering valuable insights for their potential applications in spintronics and spin caloritronics.</p>

However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD (Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Distillation), which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems, such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.</p>

            <h2>Dislocation correlations in GaN epitaxial films revealed by EBSD and XRD</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladimir M. Kaganer, Domenik Spallek, Philipp John, Oliver Brandt, Jonas Lähnemann</p>
            <p>Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of $5\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.8\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and HR-EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is modeled by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. The kink in the plot of the autocorrelation function allows a robust and accurate determination of the screening distance without making any simulation or fit. Screening distances of 2 $\mu$m and 0.3 $\mu$m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the HR-EBSD measurements is observed and quantified. In this version, an error in the processing of the HR-EBSD maps of the Si wafer is specified.</p>

            <h2>Projectively implemented altermagnetism in an exactly solvable quantum spin liquid</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avedis Neehus, Achim Rosch, Johannes Knolle, Urban F. P. Seifert</p>
            <p>Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.</p>

            <h2>Optically induced magnetic inertia and magnons from non-Markovian extension of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Branislav K. Nikolic</p>
            <p>The Landau-Lisfhitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has been the cornerstone of modeling the dynamics of localized spins, viewed as classical vectors of fixed length, within nonequilibrium magnets. When light is employed as the nonequilibrium drive, the LLG equation must be supplemented with additional terms that are usually conjectured using phenomenological arguments for direct opto-magnetic coupling between localized spins and (real or effective) magnetic field of light. However, direct coupling of magnetic field to spins is 1/c smaller than coupling of light and electrons; or both magnetic and electric fields are too fast for slow classical spins to be able to follow them. Here, we displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an extended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a theory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried by them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when photoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation. Unlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert damping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot within the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties. By applying SKFT-derived extended LLG equation, as our central result, to a light-driven ferromagnet as an example, we predict an optically induced magnetic inertia term. Its magnitude is governed by spatially nonlocal and time-dependent prefactor, leading to excitation of coherent magnons at sharp frequencies in and outside of the band of incoherent (or thermal) magnons.</p>

            <h2>Accurate Prediction of Tensorial Spectra Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ting-Wei Hsu, Zhenyao Fang, Arun Bansil, Qimin Yan</p>
            <p>Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Topological phases of electrons induced by electron-magnon interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kosuke Fujiwara, Takahiro Morimoto</p>
            <p>Topological phases of electrons such as topological insulators and quantum Hall states typically require strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. In this study, we consider an electron system coupled to a spin system, where electrons interact with magnons, quasiparticles of spin waves. We show that the interaction between electrons and magnons transfers the effect of symmetry breaking in the spin system to the electron system, whereby a non-trivial topological phase can be induced in the electron system that is otherwise topologically trivial. Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems, without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or external magnetic field for electron systems.</p>

            <h2>Correlation effects in one-dimensional metallic quantum wires under various confinements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vidit Gangwar, Vinod Ashokan, Ankush Girdhar, Klaus Morawetz, N. D. Drummond, K. N. Pathak</p>
            <p>Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $\epsilon_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - \pi^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\epsilon_{\rm c} \sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical signatures and control of time-reversal breaking in twisted nodal superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jefferson Tang, Pavel A. Volkov</p>
            <p>Recent observations of time-reversal breaking superconductivity at twisted cuprate interfaces motivate the development of new approaches to better characterize this emergent phenomenon. Here we study the dynamical properties of the order parameters at the twisted unconventional superconductor interfaces. We reveal the emergence of a soft collective mode (Josephson plasmon) at the time-reversal breaking transition, which can be tuned by temperature, twist angle or magnetic field. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that the generation of a second harmonic voltage under alternating current driving is a necessary and sufficient signature of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Finally, we demonstrate that strong nonlinear driving induces dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking, introducing a tool for their out-of-equilibrium control. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ interfaces.</p>

            <p>The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic dynamical equation yielding non-equilibrium universal scaling. It exhibits notorious non-perturbative aspects. The KPZ fixed point is strong-coupling, all the more in $d>1$. Strikingly, another, even stronger-coupling fixed point of the KPZ equation, called inviscid Burgers fixed point, has been recently unveiled. These non-pertubative features can be theoretically accessed and studied in a controlled way in all dimensions using the functional renormalisation group. We propose an overview of the related results, which provide a unified picture of the fixed-point structure and associated scaling regimes of the KPZ equation in $d=1$ and in higher dimensions.</p>

            <p>A site-selective $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study is carried out on the Kondo lattice compound CePtAl$_4$Ge$_2$, which crystallizes in a rhombohedral lattice with quasi-two-dimensional Ce layers forming a triangular lattice network. Two inequivalent Al sites, Al(1) and Al(2), are unambiguously assigned by comparing measured nuclear quadrupole parameters with electric field gradients obtained from electronic structure calculations. Knight shift analysis yields distinct hyperfine coupling constants, revealing that they arise predominantly from RKKY-type transferred hyperfine fields through conduction electrons. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal pronounced anisotropic spin fluctuations, and comparison of the relaxation rates between the two Al sites clarifies the momentum-space structure of these fluctuations. At low magnetic fields, $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is strongly enhanced on cooling toward the Néel temperature, indicating the growth of in-plane antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state.</p>

            <p>By generalizing a class of models recently introduced to account for protracted transients in biological systems, we identify a novel mechanism for hyperuniformity. In this model, competition of particles over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. We show that, in its spatially extended form, this many-particle model exhibits hyperuniform density fluctuations. Through explicit coarse-graining, we develop a hydrodynamic theory that conforms closely with the results of stochastic simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, hyperuniformity arises from the divergence of the interaction range as the system approaches the critical point. These findings may find applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics, and ecology.</p>

            <p>Whether a zero-moment antiferromagnet can host an intrinsic half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface remains an open question in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Existing proposals in compensated magnets reach only transport analogues of this limit and do not realize a genuine AFM half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface. Here we show that in two-dimensional altermagnets the Néel-vector orientation acts as an intrinsic knob for magnetic-space-group reduction that lifts the degeneracy between spin sectors. Using Janus monolayer Ta$_2$TeSeO as a realistic and clean platform and combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that rotating the Néel vector first breaks the relevant mirror symmetry, opening a gap in one spin sector of symmetry-related Weyl pairs, and then breaks the residual $C_{2z}$ symmetry, shifting the remaining Weyl cones in opposite energy directions so that a single spin sector retains a Fermi surface at the Fermi level. These two symmetry-lowering steps convert a compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetal into an intrinsic AFM half-metal. The nearly degenerate in-plane magnetic anisotropy then enables reversible switching between the two spin channels using minute strain or weak anisotropic fields. Because this mechanism relies solely on Néel-vector-induced symmetry reduction, it provides a general low-power route to intrinsic half-metallicity in compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetals.</p>

            <p>Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected. In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes. In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.</p>

We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy.

            <p>An electric bias can shift the Fermi level along the Dirac cone of a topological insulator and modify its charge transport, but tuning the electronic states and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) without destroying the surface topology is challenging. Here, we show that thin film Bi2Se3/n-p (p-n) molecular diodes form ordered interfaces where charge transfer and orbital re-hybridisation result in a decrease (increase) of the carrier density and improved mobility. In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points. Raman spectroscopy gives evidence that the coupling effect may be controlled by optical irradiation, opening a pathway towards the design of heavy-light element hybrids with optically tunable quantum transport.</p>

            <h2>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yantao Wu</p>
            <p>Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provides a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</p>

The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Decker, Christopher Watson, Junyu Zhou, Yuhao Liu, Chenxu Liu, Ang Li, Gushu Li, Samuel Stein</p>
            <p>Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction. We introduce F2, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data. Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47% and depth by 38% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of 10^(-7). These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation</p>

            <h2>Vortex leapfrogging and superfluid dissipation mechanisms in a fluid of light</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Nathan du Toit, Nicolas Pavloff, Quentin Glorieux</p>
            <p>We report the experimental observation of vortex leapfrogging in a two-dimensional fluid of light. By imprinting two vortex-antivortex pairs and tracking their real-time evolution through phase-resolved imaging, we observe a dynamics that is accurately described by a point-vortex model with an outward background flow. By precisely controlling the initial vortex separation, we identify configurations in which leapfrogging breaks down and determine the corresponding dissipation mechanisms. The first originates from phase-slip events occurring at large injected velocities. The second arises when the injection of multi-charged vortices leads to the formation of a dispersive shock wave which acts as a continuous source of phase slippage. These mechanisms advance our understanding of vortex dynamics and dissipation in superfluids.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Geometry Driven Crystallization: A Neural-Network Variational Monte Carlo Study</h2>

            <p>Wigner crystals are a paradigmatic form of interaction driven electronic order. A key open question is how Berry curvature and, more generally, quantum geometry reshape crystallization. The discovery of two-dimensional materials with relatively flat bands and pronounced Berry curvature has added fresh urgency to this question. Recent mean-field studies have proposed a topological variant of the Wigner crystal, the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), with non-zero Chern number. However it remains unclear whether the AHC survives beyond the mean-field approximation. Here, we map out the ground-state phase diagram of the $\lambda$-jellium model - a simple model whose interaction strength and Berry curvature are independently tunable - using state-of-the-art neural-network variational Monte Carlo. The AHC is found to remain stable against quantum fluctuations. Surprisingly, quantum geometric effects are found to dramatically enhance crystallization. Both the AHC and the standard Wigner Crystal are stabilized at densities up to an order of magnitude above the critical density in the absence of quantum geometry, yet still significantly below the threshold predicted by mean-field theory. These striking results highlight the rich interplay between quantum fluctuations, quantum geometry, and crystallization, providing concrete guidance for experiments and enabling future explorations of fractionalized crystals and chiral superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Effect of superconductivity on non-uniform magnetization in dirty SF junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. V. Levin, P. M. Ostrovsky</p>
            <p>We study proximity effect in a tunnel junction between a bulk superconductor and a thin disordered ferromagnetic layer on its surface. Cooper pairs penetrating from the superconductor into the ferromagnet tend to destabilize its uniform magnetic order. The competition of this effect and the intrinsic magnetic stiffness of the ferromagnet leads to a second order phase transition between uniform and non-uniform magnetic states. Using the quasiclassical Usadel equation, we derive the Landau functional for this transition and construct the complete phase diagram of the effect. We identify a special point of "resonance" at which the characteristic energy scale of the proximity effect equals the exchange field of the ferromagnet. At this point, the uniform magnetic state is unstable even in the limit of large stiffness. We further explore the parameter regime far beyond the transition and determine the properties of the resulting strongly non-uniform magnetic state.</p>

            <p>The combination of semiconducting properties and synthetically tunable chirality in chiral metal halide semiconductors (CMHS) offer a compelling platform for room temperature control over electronic spin properties, leveraging effects such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) for the development of new opto-spintronic functionalities. We report room-temperature CISS-induced magnetoresistance (CISS-MR) exceeding 100% for spin valves in a configuration consisting of a ferromagnet (FM), tunneling barrier, and CMHS. The high CISS-MR is attributed to interfacial spin-selective tunneling barrier induced by the chirality, which can produce current dissymmetry factors that surpass the limit imposed by the Jullière model governed by the intrinsic spin polarization of the adjacent FM contact. The CISS-MR exhibits a strong dependence on the CMHS composition, revealing a structure-property relationship between CISS and structural chirality. The observed exceptionally large tunneling MR response differentiates from a subtle anisotropic MR arising from the proximity effect at the FM/CMHS interface in the absence of a tunneling barrier. Our study provides insights into charge-to-spin interconversion in chiral semiconductors, offering materials design principles to control and enhance CISS response and utilize it in functional platforms.</p>

            <h2>Self-consistent solution of Eliashberg equations for metal hydride superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomas J. Escamilla, Chumin Wang</p>
            <p>In recent years, the quest for high critical-temperature superconductors has increasingly focused on metal and molecular hydrides, which have demonstrated potential for superconductivity at or near room temperature under extremely high pressures. Such hydrides were first proposed by N. W. Ashcroft in 1968, because hydrogen-rich materials possess elevated vibrational frequencies due to the low atomic mass of hydrogen. This article presents a self-consistent solution to the Eliashberg equations for analysing superconductivity in hydrides, contrasting with the commonly used McMillan-Allen-Dynes parameterized formula. We also analyse effects of the electron-phonon spectral function and the broadening parameters arising from phonon lifetime and sample imperfections on the superconducting critical temperature. Finally, both theoretical approaches are applied to a typical metal hydride superconductor, and the reliability of self-consistent solutions is validated against the experimentally measured critical temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tetsufumi Tanamoto, Keiji Ono</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigated the readout process of a spin--qubit structure based on a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor. Our study focuses on a logical qubit composed of two physical qubits. Different spin configurations result in different charge distributions, which subsequently influence the electrostatic effects on the GAA transistor. Consequently, the current flowing through the GAA transistor depends on the qubit's state. We calculated the current-voltage characteristics of the three-dimensional configurations of the qubit and GAA structures, using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Moreover, we performed circuit simulations using the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) to investigate whether a readout circuit made from complementary metal--oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can amplify the weak signals generated by the qubits. Our findings indicate that, by dynamically controlling the applied voltage within a properly designed circuit, the readout can be detected effectively based on a conventional sense amplifier.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Quantum Chiral Solitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leandro M. Chinellato, Oleg A. Starykh, Cristian D. Batista</p>
            <p>We introduce a non-perturbative framework for quantizing chiral solitons in interacting quantum spin chains. This approach provides a direct lattice extension of the well-established $S$-duality between the sine-Gordon and Thirring models, thereby bridging the gap between continuum dualities and their lattice counterparts. By constructing the quantum chiral-soliton operators explicitly, we show how their unconventional dynamics appear in the excitation spectrum and correlation functions across the full Brillouin zone. A key result is that the dominant soliton tunneling amplitude alternates in sign, $\operatorname{sgn}(t_{1+}) = (-1)^{2S+1}$, sharply distinguishing half-odd-integer from integer spin chains. We further identify characteristic signatures of these chiral excitations in the dynamical spin structure factor, demonstrating their visibility in inelastic neutron scattering. Our results open a route to experimentally probing non-perturbative features of dual quantum field theories in condensed-matter settings.</p>

            <h2>Topological spin-up triplet excitonic condensation in two-dimensional electron-hole systems</h2>

            <p>We investigate topological spin-up triplet excitonic condensation and its competition with other stabilities in a two-dimensional interacting electron-hole system taking into account Rashba spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields. Using an unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach, we self-consistently evaluate spin-selective excitonic condensate order parameters and the Chern number. The ground state phase diagram in the dependence on magnetic field and Coulomb interaction shows a spin-up triplet excitonic condensate (EC) with a nonzero Chern number, emerging uniquely away from the topologically trivial singlet and spin-down triplet EC regions. Strong spin-polarized triplet excitonic fluctuations preceding the condensation are further revealed through the signatures of the dynamical excitonic susceptibility spectra. Our results establish a class of topological quantum phases driven by excitonic coherence and suggest a realistic pathway to its realization in a distorted Janus monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides or some twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>We report disorder-mediated first-order linear and higher-order nonlinear (magneto-)transport of Ta$_2$NiSe$_7$ (TNS) in the charge-density-wave (CDW) regime. CDW transition temperature ($T_{CDW}$) and carrier density are proportional and inversely proportional to residual resistance ratio of samples, respectively. Such relation helps to understand the unique CDW order therein. High-$T_{CDW}$ TNS exhibits negative first-harmonic magnetoresistance (MR$^{1\omega}$) under a magnetic field ($B$) parallel to the direction of alternating current ($I^{\omega}$), which may arise from the anomalous velocity induced by the Berry curvature of three-dimensional topological bands near the Fermi level. As $T_{CDW}$ drops, a positive-to-negative MR$^{1\omega}$ transition is observed with decreasing perpendicular $B$, which is likely due to the contribution of Zeeman effect on current pathways in the disordered system. Moreover, interestingly, the second-harmonic nonlinear signals are suppressed, while the third-harmonic signals are significant and sensitive to both $B$ and $T_{CDW}$. Such observations, together with scaling analysis, suggest the quantum geometry quadrupole at play and the modulation of disorder on third-order nonlinearity. Our results pave an avenue for tailoring distinct-order magnetoresistive phases in disordered topological materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia</p>
            <p>We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincaré-type operators developed in our companion study~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</p>

            <p>Magnetic exchange interactions govern the macroscopic magnetic behavior of solids and underpin both fundamental spin phenomena and emerging technologies. The accurate and efficient determination of these interactions is therefore critical for predictive modeling of magnetic materials. Here we present a systematic first-principles comparison of three widely used approaches-the Least-Squares Total Energy (LSTE), the Four-State Total Energy (FSTE), and the Green's function-based Liechtenstein \textit{et al.} (LKAG) methods-applied to thirteen antiferromagnetic compounds. We introduce an framework for identifying the minimal supercells required for an accurate exchange parameter extraction in the FSTE method, significantly reducing computational cost while preserving precision. Our results show that LSTE and FSTE yield nearly identical exchange parameters, whereas the LKAG method reproduces the dominant exchange interactions but exhibits quantitative deviations. A detailed analysis of computational efficiency versus accuracy reveals that the LSTE scheme offers the most favorable balance, establishing a general, reproducible, and scalable workflow for Heisenberg mapping, while the FSTE approach remains the most straightforward for extracting specific exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Effect of thermal fluctuations on topological crossover in the chiral d+id superconducting phase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.G. Groshev, A.K. Arzhnikov</p>
            <p>The effect of thermal fluctuations on the temperature dependence of the topological index C1 of the chiral d+id superconducting phase of a two-dimensional single-band model on a triangular lattice is investigated. Thermal fluctuations are taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent functional-integral theory. It is established that when the nodal points are located far inside (outside) the Fermi contour of the normal phase, thermal fluctuations expand the relative temperature ranges in which the values of the topological index are close to integer values C1=4(-2). This expansion depends both on the value of the topological index and on the magnitude of the effective attraction between the electrons. However, as the nodal points approach the Fermi contour, topological crossovers to new C1 values are observed, which can persist over a wide temperature range. The nature and degree of influence of thermal fluctuations on these crossovers are established. It is assumed that the observed effects may also manifest in the edge state behavior of a similar system with open boundaries.</p>

            <h2>Supercritical-subcritical correspondence, asymmetric effects and antisymmetric corrections near a critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyang Li, Yuliang Jin</p>
            <p>The second-order phase transitions in the Ising model and liquid-gas systems share a universality class and critical exponents, despite the absence of $Z_2$ symmetry in the liquid-gas Hamiltonian. This discrepancy highlights a central puzzle in critical phenomena: what is the influence of asymmetry on scaling laws? For over a century, this question has been explored through examining violations of the empirical ``rectilinear diameter law'' for the subcritical coexistence curve, where asymmetry could generate singular corrections. Here, we extend this investigation to the supercritical regime. We propose a supercritical-subcritical correspondence, drawing a formal analogy between the subcritical coexistence curve and recently defined supercritical boundary lines ($L^\pm$ lines). Our theory predicts that the linear mixing of physical fields - a hallmark of asymmetric systems - produces universal scaling corrections, with antisymmetric coefficients, in these supercritical loci. We verify these predictions using liquid-gas data from the NIST database and a model liquid-liquid transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same asymmetric scaling framework governs the behavior of higher-order cumulants in the order parameter distribution.</p>

            <p>The emergence of the Abrikosov lattice in the normal phase of type-II superconducting films when the magnetic field approaches the critical field $H_{c2}$ from above was predicted in Ref.~\cite{GVV2011}. In the quantum fluctuation regime \cite{GL2001} it is characterized by the formation of relatively large (with sizes of order $\xi_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \xi_{\mathrm{BCS}}\sqrt{H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})}$) ``long lived'' (lifetime of order $\tau_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \hbar \Delta^{-1} H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})$) clusters of rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs - signatures of developing Abrikosov vortices. We demonstrate that these fluctuation-induced vortex clusters, previously considered unobservable due to their ultrafast dynamics and weak (only logarithmically singular) contribution to the dc-conductivity, can in fact be detected through their distinct electromagnetic signature. By analyzing the high-frequency electromagnetic response of these rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting film, we predict a pronounced and measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity arising directly from quantum fluctuations. This enhancement is expected to occur at characteristic frequencies $\omega_{QF} \sim \hbar^{-1}\Delta(H-H_{c2})/H_{c2}$, which are well below the superconducting threshold at $2\hbar^{-1}\Delta $, where a similar increase in imaginary conductivity occurs in the superconducting phase. For niobium, a prototypical type II superconductor, $\omega_{QF}$ lies in the experimentally accessible microwave range, making the effect directly testable with modern microwave spectroscopy.</p>

            <p>We develop a first-principles many-body framework to describe the dynamics of photocarriers and phonons in semiconductors following ultrafast excitation. Our approach incorporates explicit ab initio light-matter coupling and first-principles collision integrals for carrier-carrier, carrier-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering. It also yields time-dependent quasiparticle and phonon frequency renormalizations, along with light-induced coherent atomic motion. The equations of motion are solved in a maximally localized Wannier basis, ensuring gauge-consistent scattering integrals and ultradense momentum sampling, thereby enabling direct comparison with pump-probe experiments. The method can be coupled to constrained density-functional theory to access light-induced structural phase transitions at longer times after the light pulse. We showcase the capabilities and predictive power of this framework on MoS$_2$ and h-BN monolayers. For MoS$_2$, we resolve photoinduced renormalizations of electronic and lattice properties, ultrafast carrier relaxation, hot-phonon dynamics, and displacive coherent atomic motion. Including carrier-carrier scattering is crucial to obtain realistic photocarrier equilibration times, while omitting phonon-phonon scattering leads to incorrect long-time lattice thermalization and a factor of two larger A$_{1g}$ coherent phonon damping time. For h-BN, we quantify photoinduced changes in the electronic, optical, and lattice responses in quasi-equilibrium, demonstrating a fluence-dependent enhancement of screening and melting of excitonic features.</p>

By calculating the Zak phase we show that also in the presence of the substrate there is a topological phase transition and that topologically protected edge modes emerge for finite chains. Finally, we demonstrate the long-range heat transport along the chain due to the coupling to the surface waves of the sample.

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ has garnered significant interest due to its high Curie temperature (T$_C$), large saturation magnetization, and complex magnetic behavior arising, in part, from multiple inequivalent iron sites and vacancies. While several aspects of its complex magnetic and structural characteristics have been examined through careful experiments and first principles studies, much of it remains debatable. In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive temperature-dependent Raman spectrum for bulk Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ and in the process reveal an interesting peak shift anomaly at 150 K. We discuss the possible relationship of this Raman anomaly with the anomalous lattice expansion reported earlier for this material at around 110 K. The impact of the anomalous lattice expansion on the magnetic anisotropy in this van der Waals material is also revealed by an isothermal magnetization analysis. These findings will prove crucial for the use of Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ in high-performance spintronic devices.</p>

Using a tight-binding model on the Honeycomb lattice inspired by the frontier electronic states of CTFs, we show that introducing an effective uniaxial strain--implemented as a modulation of electron hopping on a subset of bonds--can generate a series of distinct topological band structures. This effect can be realized in practice through chemical substitution of linkers along the strained bonds. First-principles calculations demonstrate that replacing biphenyl with pyrene linkers drives a CTF to the brink of a HOTI phase, suggesting a viable route toward topological band-structure engineering in COFs.</p>

These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</p>

            <h2>Many interacting particles in solution. III. Spectral analysis of the associated Neumann--Poincaré-type operators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia</p>
            <p>The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce composite many-body Neumann--Poincaré-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works~\cite{supplem_prl,supplem_pre,supplem_pre_force}.</p>

            <h2>Calibration of a DEM contact model for wet industrial granular materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sahar Pourandi, P. Christian van der Sande, Igor A. Ostanin, Thomas Weinhart</p>
            <p>This study presents and calibrates a Discrete Element Method (DEM) contact model for wet granular materials in the pendular regime. The model extends a previously calibrated dry contact formulation by incorporating liquid bridges that generate capillary adhesion between particles, while liquid migration is represented through evolving bridge volumes. Two reactor-grade polypropylene powders with different particle size distributions, bulk densities, and surface morphologies are investigated, resulting in distinct wetting behavior. A schematic framework is introduced to relate increasing liquid content to the transition from dry to wet contacts using two key parameters: the minimum liquid film volume and the maximum liquid bridge volume. These parameters are calibrated using dynamic angle of repose measurements from rotating drum experiments. The calibrated model reproduces the experimental flow behavior of both powders: full agreement is obtained for the coarser, more porous powder across all liquid contents, while for the finer, denser powder, agreement is achieved at low to moderate liquid contents. At higher liquid contents, discrepancies arise due to agglomeration effects amplified by particle scaling. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic angle of repose as a calibration target and highlight the limitations of particle scaling for strongly cohesive wet granular systems. The proposed framework provides a practical basis for DEM-based modeling of wet powder flow in industrial processes.</p>

            <h2>Order parameter for non-mean-field spin glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michele Castellana</p>
            <p>We propose a novel renormalization group (RG) method for non mean-field models of spin glasses, which leads to the emergence of a novel order parameter. Unlike previous approaches where the RG procedure is based on a priori notions on the system, our analysis follows a minimality principle, where no a priori assumption is made. We apply our approach to a spin-glass model built on a hierarchical lattice. In the RG decimation procedure, a novel order parameter spontaneously emerges from the system symmetries, and self-similarity features of the RG transformation only. This order parameter is the projection of the spin configurations on the ground state of the system. Kadanoff's majority rule for ferromagnetic systems is replaced by a more complex scheme, which involves such novel order parameter. The ground state thus acts as a pattern which translates spin configurations from one length scale to another. The rescaling RG procedure is based on a minimal, information-theory approach and, combined with the decimation, it yields a complete RG transformation. Below the upper critical dimension, the predictions for the critical exponent $\nu$, which describes the critical divergence of the correlation length, are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations from both this and previous studies. Overall, this study opens new avenues in the understanding of the critical ordering of realistic spin glasses, and it can be applied to spin-glass models on a cubic lattice and nearest-neighbor couplings which directly model spin-glass materials, such as AuFe, CuMn and other magnetic alloys.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aprem P. Joy, Roman Lange, Achim Rosch</p>
            <p>Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.</p>

            <h2>Computational Screening and Discovery of Silver-Indium Halide Double Salts</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christos Tyrpenou, G. Krishnamurthy Grandhi, Paola Vivo, Mikaël Kepenekian, George Volonakis</p>
            <p>Perovskite-inspired materials have emerged as promising candidates for both outdoor and indoor photovoltaic applications owing to their favorable optoelectronic properties and reduced toxicity. Here, we employ the experimentally realized AgBiI$_4$ double salt as a structural prototype and replace Bi$^{3+}$ with In$^{3+}$ to design a novel lead-free halide compound, AgInI$_4$. First-principles calculations predict that AgInI$_4$ is both chemically and dynamically stable, exhibiting a direct band gap of 1.72 eV, comparable to its bismuth analogue. However, its predicted photovoltaic performance, evaluated using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency metric, is lower under both solar and LED illumination. This reduction arises primarily from symmetry-forbidden optical transitions and the absence of Bi-derived 6s$^2$ lone-pair states at the valence band maximum. High-throughput screening of the Ag-In-I ternary phase-space reveals several more stable and metastable compounds that fall into two structural families: tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated, with characteristic band gaps near 3.0 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. Despite multiple synthetic attempts, the predicted AgInI$_4$ phase could not be experimentally realized, underscoring the challenges of stabilizing indium-based halide double salts. While these materials are unlikely to serve as efficient photovoltaic absorbers, their tunable band gaps and stability make them promising candidates for charge transport and other optoelectronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuation-Induced Supersolidity at the Superfluid-Solid Interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Baptiste Coquinot, Ragheed Alhyder, Alberto Cappellaro, Mikhail Lemeshko</p>
            <p>Supersolidity, combining superfluid and crystalline orders, has been realized in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates by tuning interatomic interactions. Here we show that supersolidity can also emerge from mode coupling at a superfluid-solid interface, without modifying bulk interactions and for a broad class of superfluids. Using an analytical and numerical treatment of the coupled superfluid and phonon fields, we derive the criterion for a density-modulation instability driven by interfacial coupling and dependent on dimensionality. In superfluid helium, the instability first appears at the roton mode, while in a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interactions it occurs at the lowest accessible wave vector set by the system size. Beyond the threshold, the ground state acquires an interfacial density modulation while the bulk remains superfluid, forming a hybrid superfluid-supersolid phase. Our results identify interfacial mode coupling as a promising route to supersolidity, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of interfacial supersolid and bulk superfluid quantum properties.</p>

            <h2>Two-phase hydrodynamic model of active colloid motion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Kiverin, S. Luguev, I. Yakovenko</p>
            <p>The paper presents a two-phase hydrodynamic model for the numerical simulation of collective motion in a thin layer of active colloids containing spherical microswimmers. The model accounts for three fundamental mechanisms governing the dynamics of the active colloid: the random motion of the microswimmers, their mutual collisions, and their interaction with the surrounding fluid phase. The accurate resolution of the characteristic time scales associated with each mechanism is crucial for reproducing the different dynamic modes. The model reproduces two primary modes of motion: Brownian and collective, as well as the transition between them. It is demonstrated that hydrodynamic interactions begin to play a significant role when the microswimmer velocity exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the kinetic energy transferred to the fluid phase is sufficient to generate a noticeable feedback effect on the swimmers' motion. Conversely, a further increase in microswimmers' velocity enhances the role of collisions, causing the system to revert from a collective mode back to a Brownian-like state. A similar transition occurs at higher volume fractions of microswimmers within the colloid.</p>

            <h2>Spontaneous Ratchet Currents and Transition Dynamics in Active Wetting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noah Grodzinski, Robert L. Jack, Michael E. Cates</p>
            <p>Self-propelled particles accumulate on repulsive barriers in so-called active wetting, but the relationship between this process and equilibrium wetting remains unclear. Using an exact (noiseless) hydrodynamic framework for an active lattice gas, we show, using a slit geometry with periodic boundary conditions, that active matter exhibits both fully- and partially-wet states, with a critical wetting transition between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking ratchet current in the partially wet state, leading to departure of the bulk densities from their binodal values and the emergence of a novel dynamical pathway for the full-to-partial wetting transition. We elucidate this modified dynamical pathway using a minimal model. The results, while establishing a direct connection between active and equilibrium wetting, also identify the nonequilibrium consequences of activity.</p>
