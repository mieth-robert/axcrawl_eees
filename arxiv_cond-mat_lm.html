            <h2>Electron Transport in One-Dimensional Disordered Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. Slavin, Y. Savin, M. Klimov, M. Kiyashko</p>
            <p>We have studied the peculiarities of electron transport in one-dimensional (1D) disordered chain at the presence of correlations between on-site interaction and tunneling integrals. In the considered models the disorder in host-lattice sites positions is caused by presence of defects, impurities, existence of electron-phonon interaction, e.t.c. It is shown, that for certain combination of parameters the localization of electron state, inherited by a various of 1D disordered systems, disappear and electron transport becomes possible. The parameters of this transport are established.</p>

            <h2>An anomalous particle-exchange mechanism for two isolated Bose gases merged into one</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Q. H. Liu</p>
            <p>In an isolated ideal Bose system with a fixed energy, the number of microstates depends solely on the configurations of bosons in excited states, implying zero entropy for particles in the ground state. When two such systems merge, the resulting entropy is less than the sum of the individual entropies. This entropy decrease is numerically shown to arise from an effectively but anomalous exchange of particles in excited states, where $\overline{N}!/(\overline{N}_{1}!\overline{N}_{2}!)<1$. Here, $\overline{N}$, $\overline{N}_{1}$, and $\overline{N}_{2}$ are real decimals representing, respectively, the mean number of particles in excited states in the merged system and the two individual systems before merging, with $\overline{N}<\overline{N}_{1}+\overline{N}_{2}$.</p>

            <h2>Brightening interlayer excitons by electric-field-driven hole transfer in bilayer WSe2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Ouyang, Erfu Liu, Soonyoung Cha, Raj Kumar Paudel, Yiyang Sun, Zhaoran Xu, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Nathaniel M. Gabor, Yia-Chung Chang, Chun Hung Lui</p>
            <p>We observe the interlayer A1s^I, A2s^I, and B1s^I excitons in bilayer WSe2 under applied electric fields using reflectance contrast spectroscopy. Remarkably, these interlayer excitons remain optically bright despite being well separated from symmetry-matched intralayer excitons-a regime where conventional two-level coupling models fail unless unphysically large coupling strengths are assumed. To uncover the origin of this brightening, we perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations and find that the applied electric field distorts the valence-band Bloch states, driving the hole wavefunction from one layer to the other. This field-driven interlayer hole transfer imparts intralayer character to the interlayer excitons, thereby enhancing their oscillator strength without requiring hybridization with bright intralayer states. Simulations confirm that this mechanism accounts for the major contribution to the observed brightness, with excitonic hybridization playing only a minor role. Our results identify interlayer hole transfer as a robust and general mechanism for brightening interlayer excitons in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially when inter- and intralayer excitons are energetically well separated.</p>

            <h2>Determining Exciton Binding Energy and Reduced Effective Mass in Metal Tri-Halide Perovskites from Optical and Impedance Spectroscopy Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. Lizárraga, J. A. Guerra, L. A. Enrique-Moran, E. Serquen, E. Ventura, Cesar E. P. Villegas, A. R. Rocha, P. Venezuela</p>
            <p>Accurate determination of the exciton binding energy and reduced effective mass in halide perovskites is of utmost importance for the selective design of optoelectronic devices. Although these properties are currently determined by several spectroscopic techniques, complementary theoretical models are often required to bridge macroscopic and microscopic properties. Here, we present a novel method to determine these quantities while fully accounting for polarization effects due to carrier interactions with longitudinal optical phonons. Our approach estimates the exciton-polaron binding energy from optical absorption measurements using a recently developed Elliott based Band Fluctuations model. The reduced effective mass is obtained via the Pollmann-Buttner exciton-polaron model, which is based on the Frohlich polaron framework, where the strength of the electron-phonon interaction arises from changes in the dielectric properties. The procedure is applied to the family of perovskites ABX3 (A = MA, FA, Cs; B = Pb; X = I, Br, Cl), showing excellent agreement with high field magnetoabsorption and other optical-resolved techniques. The results suggest that the Pollmann-Buttner model offers a robust and novel approach for determining the reduced effective mass in metal tri-halide perovskites and other polar materials exhibiting free exciton bands.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomas Jungwirth, Jairo Sinova, Rafael M. Fernandes, Qihang Liu, Hikaru Watanabe, Shuichi Murakami, Satoru Nakatsuji, Libor Smejkal</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism is a collinear compensated magnetically-ordered phase with a d, g or i-wave anisotropy and alternating spin polarization of the electronic structure in the position and momentum space. Its recent discovery was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research context, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of spontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated altermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on microscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We highlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in altermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional ferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely explored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions by references to relevant experiments.</p>

            <h2>Gigantic Harmonic Generation in Néel-Torque Antiferromagnetic Resonance</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kuangyin Deng, Ran Cheng</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the resonant and higher-harmonic magnetic responses of a collinear antiferromagnet induced by Néel spin-orbit torques (NSOTs). By deriving the dynamical susceptibilities up to the third harmonic, we find remarkable NSOT-induced amplifications of the linear and nonlinear magnetic dynamics by orders of magnitude compared to conventional spin-orbit torques, enabling highly-efficient frequency conversion in the sub-terahertz frequency range. We then propose a multilayer antiferromagnetic nano-device leveraging the gigantic harmonic generation to achieve unprecedented frequency amplifiers and converters. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role of the NSOTs in nonlinear dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Band-Gap Tunability in Anharmonic Perovskite-like Semiconductors Driven by Polar Electron-Phonon Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pol Benítez, Ruoshi Jiang, Siyu Chen, Cibrán López, Josep-Lluís Tamarit, Edgardo Saucedo, Bartomeu Monserrat, Claudio Cazorla</p>
            <p>The ability to finely tune optoelectronic properties in semiconductors is crucial for the development of advanced technologies, ranging from photodetectors to photovoltaics. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to achieve such tunability by utilizing electric fields to excite low-energy polar optical phonon modes, which strongly couple to electronic states in anharmonic semiconductors. We conducted a high-throughput screening of over $10,000$ materials, focusing on centrosymmetric compounds with imaginary polar phonon modes and suitable band gaps, and identified $310$ promising candidates with potential for enhanced optoelectronic tunability. From this set, three perovskite-like compounds --Ag$_3$SBr, BaTiO$_3$, and PbHfO$_3$-- were selected for in-depth investigation based on their contrasting band-gap behavior with temperature. Using first-principles calculations, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations, tight-binding models, and anharmonic Fröhlich theory, we analyzed the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results show that polar phonon distortions can induce substantial band-gap modulations at ambient conditions, including reductions of up to $70\%$ in Ag$_3$SBr and increases of nearly $23\%$ in BaTiO$_3$, relative to values calculated at zero temperature, while PbHfO$_3$ exhibits minimal change. These contrasting responses arise from distinct electron-phonon coupling mechanisms and orbital hybridization at the band edges. This work establishes key design principles for harnessing polar lattice dynamics to engineer tunable optoelectronic properties, paving the way for adaptive technologies such as wavelength-selective optical devices and solar absorbers.</p>

            <h2>Quantum polaritons go hyperbolic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kateryna Domina, Tetiana Slipchenko, D.-H.-Minh Nguyen, Alexey B. Kuzmenko, Luis Martin-Moreno, Dario Bercioux, Alexey Y. Nikitin</p>
            <p>Magnetized charge-neutral graphene supports collective hybrid electronic excitations - polaritons - which have quantum origin. In contrast to polaritons in doped graphene, which arise from intraband electronic transitions, those in charge-neutral graphene originate from interband transitions between Landau levels, enabled by the applied magnetic field. Control of such quantum polaritons and shaping their wavefronts remains totally unexplored. Here we design an artificial two-dimensional quantum material formed by charge-neutral graphene nanoribbons exposed to an external magnetic field. In such metasurface, quantum polaritons acquire a hyperbolic dispersion. We find that the topology of the isofrequency curves of quantum hyperbolic magnetoexciton polaritons excited in this quantum material can change, so that the shape of isofrequency curves transforms from a closed to open one by tuning the external magnetic field strength. At the topological transition, we observe canalization phenomena, consisting of the propagation of all the polaritonic plane waves in the continuum along the same direction when excited by a point source. From a general perspective, our fundamental findings introduce a novel type of actively-tunable quantum polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion and can be further generalized to other types of quantum materials and polaritons in them. In practice, quantum hyperbolic polaritons can be used for applications related to quantum sensing and computing.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyuan Sun, Stafford Withington, Christopher Thomas, Songyuan Zhao</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step towards their application to superconducting electronics and quantum technologies. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</p>

            <p>We propose a novel scheme to realize the supersolid phase in ultracold gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules by engineering an additional anisotropy in inter-molecular dipolar interaction via an elliptically polarized microwave. It is shown through quantum Monte-Carlo calculations that the interplay of the anisotropies between the interaction and trapping potential gives rise to rich quantum phases. Particularly, it is found that the supersolid phase emerges in the parameter regime accessible to current experiments. Our study paves the way for exploring the properties of supersolid phases in ultracold gases of polar molecules.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting gap and its Little-Parks like oscillations with high-order harmonics in lithium intercalated 1T-TiSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Yi Ji, Zongzheng Cao, Yi Hu, Haoyang Wu, Heng Wang, Yuying Zhu, Haiwen Liu, Lexian Yang, Qi-Kun Xue, Ding Zhang</p>
            <p>The superconducting phase of doped 1T-TiSe$_2$ is a fruitful playground for exploring exotic quantum phenomena such as the anomalous metal state and spontaneously formed superconducting network. Here, we address these emergent states by studying the superconducting gap of lithium intercalated TiSe$_2$-a fundamental quantity that has remained unexplored so far. We fabricate a device that combines solid-state lateral lithium intercalation, resistance measurements and tunneling spectroscopy. We successfully probe the superconducting gap of TiSe$_2$ and reveal that the gap closing temperature well exceeds the transition temperature ($T_c$) expected from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, indicating pronounced superconducting fluctuations even in a bulk-like system. Moreover, the symmetric gap persists even in the anomalous metal state, demonstrating the particle-hole symmetry of this exotic phase directly from the density of states. Finally, the superconducting gap shows magneto-oscillations with higher harmonics, attesting to a rather regular structure of the intrinsic superconducting network.</p>

            <h2>Density functional theory study of effect of NO annealing on electronic structures and carrier scattering properties of 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nahoto Funaki, Kosei Sugiyama, Mitsuharu Uemoto, Tomoya Ono</p>
            <p>The effect of the nitrided layer introduced by NO annealing on the electronic structure and carrier scattering property of the 4H-SiC(0001)/SiO$_2$ interface is investigated by the density functional theory calculation using the interface models where the areal N atom density corresponds to that in practical devices. The areal N atom density is one third of the areal C atom density in practical devices. It is found that the nitrided layer screens the unfavorable Coulomb interaction of O atoms in the SiO$_2$. However, the electrons flowing under the nitrided layer are significantly scattered by the fluctuation of potential due to the low areal N atom density. These results imply that the areal N atom density should be increased so that the fluctuation of potential is suppressed.</p>

            <h2>Half-metallicity and anomalous Slater-Pauling behaviour in half-Heusler CrMnSb</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Himanshu Joshi, Shradhanjali Dewan, Lalrin Kima, Aldrin Lalremtluanga, Homnath Luitel, K. C. Bhamu, D.P. Rai</p>
            <p>This study provides a first-principles insight into half-Heusler CrMnSb to understand its deviation from the conventional Slater-Pauling semiconducting behavior. CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.</p>

            <h2>Spatial QUBO: Convolutional Formulation of Large-Scale Binary Optimization with Dense Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Yamashita, Hideyuki Suzuki</p>
            <p>The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p>

            <h2>Coercivity Panorama of Dynamic Hysteresis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma</p>
            <p>We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength $\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c=H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The $H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$ scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis obtained with the Curie-Weiss model. Our work provides a panoramic view of the finite-time evolution of the stochastic $\phi^4$ model, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical Heterogeneity in Supercooled Water and its Spectroscopic Fingerprints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesare Malosso, Edward Danquah Donkor, Stefano Baroni, Ali Hassanali</p>
            <p>A growing body of theoretical and experimental evidence strongly supports the existence of a second liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in deeply supercooled water leading to the co-existence of two phases: a high-and low-density liquid (HDL and LDL). While the thermodynamics associated with this putative LLCP has been well characterised through numerical simulations, the dynamical properties of these two phases close to the critical point remain much less understood. In this work, we investigate their dynamical and spectroscopic features using machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Dynamical analyses using the van-Hove correlation function, reveal that LDL exhibits very sluggish and heterogeneous molecular mobility, in contrast to the faster and more homogeneous dynamics of HDL. Infrared absorption (IR) spectra further show clear vibrational distinctions between LDL and HDL, in particular in the far IR region between 400 - 1000 cm-1. Together, these findings provide new dynamical fingerprints that clarify the microscopic behavior of supercooled water and offer valuable guidance for experimental efforts aimed at detecting the long-sought liquid-liquid transition.</p>

            <h2>Dissipation Pathways in a Photosynthetic Complex</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ignacio Gustin, Chang Woo Kim, Ignacio Franco</p>
            <p>Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for understanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes such as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are well established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy is funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex molecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is partially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria. Specifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific vibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we introduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed theory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a state-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific spectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by low-frequency modes ($<$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance with the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the most important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\sim$200 cm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned intramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($>$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no role in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow energy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the energy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value, these insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices and, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control tasks.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nianrui Fu, Siyuan Wang, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan</p>
            <p>Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</p>

            <p>In the development of active animate materials, electromechanical coupling is highly attractive to realize mechanoresponsive functionality. Piezoelectricity is the most utilized electromechanical phenomenon due to the wide availability of materials that display precise and reliable coupling. However, the inherent directionality of these materials is constrained by the symmetry of their crystal structure, which limits the choice of available properties in natural piezoelectric materials. A solution to alleviate this limitation could be to leverage geometry or architecture at the mesoscale. Here, we present an integrated framework to design and 3D-print piezoelectric truss metamaterials with customizable anisotropic responses. To explore the vast design space of truss metamaterials, we employ generative machine learning to optimize the topology and geometry of truss lattices and achieve target piezoelectricity. Then, we develop an in-gel-3D printing method to fabricate polymer-ceramic piezoelectric truss metamaterial structures using a composite slurry of photo-curable resin and lead-free piezoelectric particles. The ML framework discovers designs exhibiting unconventional behaviors, including auxetic, unidirectional, and omnidirectional piezoelectricity, while the additive manufacturing technique ensures shaping freedom and precision in fabricating these metamaterials at small scales. Our results show an improvement of over 48% in the specific hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficient in optimized metamaterials over bulk lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We successfully achieved metamaterials with higher transverse piezoelectric coupling coefficient than its longitudinal coefficient, which is a phenomenon that is rare in bulk materials. Our approach enables customizable piezoelectric responses and paves the way towards the development of a new generation of electro-active animate materials.</p>

            <h2>Neural models of multiscale systems: conceptual limitations, stochastic parametrizations, and a climate application</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Falasca</p>
            <p>This work explores key conceptual limitations in data-driven modeling of multiscale dynamical systems, focusing on neural emulators and stochastic climate modeling. A skillful climate model should capture both stationary statistics and responses to external perturbations. While current autoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically struggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical system to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models under two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another with only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case, the models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses in ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial observations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \textit{proper} variables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees of freedom. These issues are not specific to neural networks but reflect fundamental limitations of data-driven modeling and the need to target the slow dynamics of the system. We argue that physically grounded strategies -- such as coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations -- are critical, both conceptually and practically, for the skillful emulation of complex systems like the coupled climate system. Building on these insights, we turn to a more realistic application: a stochastic reduced neural model of the sea surface temperature field and the net radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere, assessing its stationary statistics, response to temperature forcing, and interpretability.</p>

            <h2>A scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jared Gibson, Zhanzhi Jiang, Angela Kou</p>
            <p>Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them. This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits. Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in the single-photon regime to be > 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip readout circuitry. Our work introduces a new tool for using circuit QED to measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.</p>

            <h2>Scaling Laws of Quantum Information Lifetime in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingzhi Zhang, Fangjun Hu, Runzhe Mo, Tianyang Chen, Hakan E. Türeci, Quntao Zhuang</p>
            <p>Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.</p>

            <p>Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging, spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature. We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1 over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiqiang Chen, Kai Gong</p>
            <p>Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na+, Cl-, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an exponential decay model based on the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, such as surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</p>

            <h2>On Boltzmann Averaging in Ab Initio Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendrik H. Heenen, Karsten Reuter</p>
            <p>Ab initio thermodynamics is a widespread, computationally efficient approach to predict the stable configuration of a surface in contact with a surrounding (gas or liquid) environment. In a prevalent realization of this approach, this stable configuration is simply equated with the structure in a considered candidate pool that exhibits the lowest surface free energy. Here we discuss the possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing, higher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when the extended surface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic boundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged averages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling in a surface unit-cell exceeding the system's correlation length. In contrast, averaging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally ill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface oxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in a practical context.</p>

Our approach allows for the creation of spin-split bands and the corresponding transport properties provide an effective platform for circularly polarized light isolation without the need of geometrodynamic spin-orbit interaction. Beyond the concurrent solid-state materials, we anticipate our work to offer photonic crystals as a versatile platform to test the spin-split band properties and inspire optical designs for photospintronic applications.</p>

            <p>The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators ($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively in the symmetry-broken phase.</p>

            <p>Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially, providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second, we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on them.</p>

            <h2>Topological Holography: Towards a Unification of Landau and Beyond-Landau Physics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heidar Moradi, Seyed Faroogh Moosavian, Apoorv Tiwari</p>
            <p>We outline a holographic framework that attempts to unify Landau and beyond-Landau paradigms of quantum phases and phase transitions. Leveraging a modern understanding of symmetries as topological defects/operators, the framework uses a topological order to organize the space of quantum systems with a global symmetry in one lower dimension. The global symmetry naturally serves as an input for the topological order. In particular, we holographically construct a String Operator Algebra (SOA) which is the building block of symmetric quantum systems with a given symmetry $G$ in one lower dimension. This exposes a vast web of dualities which act on the space of $G$-symmetric quantum systems. The SOA facilitates the classification of gapped phases as well as their corresponding order parameters and fundamental excitations, while dualities help to navigate and predict various corners of phase diagrams and analytically compute universality classes of phase transitions. A novelty of the approach is that it treats conventional Landau and unconventional topological phase transitions on an equal footing, thereby providing a holographic unification of these seemingly-disparate domains of understanding. We uncover a new feature of gapped phases and their multi-critical points, which we dub fusion structure, that encodes information about which phases and transitions can be dual to each other. Furthermore, we discover that self-dual systems typically posses emergent non-invertible, i.e., beyond group-like symmetries. We apply these ideas to $1+1d$ quantum spin chains with finite Abelian group symmetry, using topologically-ordered systems in $2+1d$. We predict the phase diagrams of various concrete spin models, and analytically compute the full conformal spectra of non-trivial quantum phase transitions, which we then verify numerically.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huaisong Zhao, Feng Yuan, Tianxing Ma, Peng Zou</p>
            <p>The measurement of the pairing gap plays an essential role in studying the physical properties of superconductors or superfluids. We develop a strategy for measure the pairing gap through the dynamical excitations. With the random phase approximation (RPA), the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional attractive Fermi-Hubbard model are studied by calculating the dynamical structure factor. Two distinct collective modes are investigated: a Goldstone phonon mode at the transferred momentum ${\bf q}=\left[0,0\right]$ and a roton mode at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$. The roton mode demonstrates a sharp molecular peak in the low-energy regime. Remarkably, the area under the roton molecular peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which persists even in three-dimensional and spin-orbit coupled (SOC) optical lattices. This result provides a potential strategy to measure the pairing gap of lattice systems experimentally by measuring the dynamical structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.</p>

            <h2>Ab initio modelling of quantum dot qubits: Coupling, gate dynamics and robustness versus charge noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamza Jnane, Simon C Benjamin</p>
            <p>Electron spins in semiconductor devices are highly promising building blocks for quantum processors (QPs). Commercial semiconductor foundries can create QPs using the same processes employed for conventional chips, once the QP design is suitably specified. There is a vast accessible design space; to identify the most promising options for fabrication, one requires predictive modelling of interacting electrons in real geometries and complex non-ideal environments. In this work we explore a modelling method based on real-space grids, an ab initio approach without assumptions relating to device topology and therefore with wide applicability. Given an electrode geometry, we determine the exchange coupling between quantum dot qubits, and model the full evolution of a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate to predict qubit loss and infidelity rates for various voltage profiles. We determine full, 3D solutions and introduce a method which can obtain near-identical predictions using far more efficient 2D computations. Moreover we explore the impact of unwanted charge defects (static and dynamic) in the environment, and test robust pulse sequences. As an example we exhibit a sequence correcting both systematic errors and (unknown) charge defects, observing an order of magnitude boost in fidelity. The technique can thus identify the most promising device designs for fabrication, as well as bespoke control sequences for each such device.</p>

            <p>In magnetic topological insulators, spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking by intrinsic magnetic order can gap the topological surface spectrum, resulting in exotic properties like axion electrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological magnetoelectric responses. Understanding the magnetic order and its coupling to topological states is essential to harness these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant magnetic dipole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic fluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its antiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover in the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, whereby two-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give way to three-dimensional long-range order at the Néel temperature. We also observe the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure. More generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical spectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Gonzalo Usaj, Nathan Goldman</p>
            <p>The Středa formula establishes a fundamental connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the Středa formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems, while offering a link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-Středa response is regularized through Cesàro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk, and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-Středa response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally-invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-Středa response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.</p>

For weak interactions, in contrast, the ground state is given by the harmonic trap. In this work, we conduct a variational study of the transition between these two limits. We find that this transition occurs abruptly at the critical interaction strength whose value is universal if scaled appropriately with the number of particles. To connect the abrupt change in the properties of the system to the classical description of phase transitions, we analyze the static response of the Bose gas related to the isothermal compressibility. Finally, we perform numerically exact calculations for a few particles to demonstrate the effects of finite range interactions on this transition. We conclude that finite range effects wash out the point of transition.</p>

            <p>In magnetic systems, angular momentum is carried by spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Nonlocal devices, comprising heavy-metal nanowires on magnetic insulators like yttrium iron garnet (YIG), enable angular momentum transport via magnons. These magnons are polarized by spin accumulation at the interface through the spin Hall effect (SHE) and detected via the inverse SHE (iSHE). The processes are generally reciprocal, as demonstrated by comparable efficiencies when reversing injector and detector roles. However, introducing Ru, which enables the orbital Hall effect (OHE), disrupts this reciprocity. In our system, magnons polarized through combined SHE and OHE and detected via iSHE are 35% more efficient than the reverse process. We attribute this nonreciprocity to nonzero spin vorticity, resulting from varying electron drift velocities across the Pt/Ru interface. This study highlights the potential of orbital transport mechanisms in influencing angular momentum transport and efficiency in nonlocal spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation after crossing the critical point. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-induced phase transition in periodically driven free-fermionic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pallabi Chatterjee, Ranjan Modak</p>
            <p>It is well known that unitary evolution tends to increase entanglement, whereas continuous monitoring counteracts this growth by pinning the wavefunction trajectories to the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In this work, we investigate the fate of the measurement-induced phase transition in a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping amplitude is modulated periodically in time using a square pulse. In the high-frequency limit, a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian quantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in {Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021)}] reveals that if the hopping amplitude is varied symmetrically around zero, the system always favors the area-law phase, where the steady-state entanglement entropy is independent of subsystem size. In contrast, asymmetry in the drive amplitudes tends to promote entanglement growth. Furthermore, numerical evidence for the system sizes accessible to us suggests that decreasing the drive frequency typically favors entanglement growth. For such driven systems, at least for reasonably small frequency regimes, as a function of measurement strength, we observe a potential signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition between a gapless critical phase, characterized by logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy with subsystem size, and a gapped area-law phase. However, it is almost impossible to rule out the possibility that the transition observed here is not an actual thermodynamic transition, but a finite-size crossover between logarithmic to area law entanglement phase. Even in that scenario, the critical length scale beyond which the area law phase prevails increases with the increasing time period of driving. On the other hand, for a symmetric drive, the system consistently exhibits an area-law phase, regardless of the driving frequency.</p>

            <p>Fermionic superfluid junctions typically exhibit suppressed thermal and spin transport due to the presence of a pairing gap but allow coherent particle transport. While dissipation generally weakens coherent transport, it can also induce excitations that open other transport channels. In this work, we experimentally study a one-dimensional superfluid junction of strongly interacting fermions with local particle loss and observe dissipation-induced thermal and spin transport that appear to saturate at strong dissipation. Notably, in this regime, the measured thermal and spin conductances are comparable to the universal quantized conductance of one-dimensional ideal Fermi gas. Qualitatively similar behavior is observed for two dissipation mechanisms, either spin-imbalanced or pairwise losses. Our findings provide new insights into transport in interacting open quantum systems and suggest possibilities of dissipative control of spin and thermoelectric transport.</p>

We analyze the flow of an electronic fluid with a finite odd viscosity in the presence of such disorder and compute the conductivity tensor. We find that in the generic case of finite intrinsic conductivity, the Hall angle in the viscous regime is parametrically suppressed compared to the elastic regime. In the special case where the intrinsic conductivity vanishes, the ratio between the transverse and the longitudinal resistivities matches the ratio between the odd and even components of the viscosity tensor.</p>

            <p>Experiments have reached a monumental capacity for designing and synthesizing microscopic particles for self-assembly, making it possible to precisely control particle concentrations, shapes, and interactions. However, more physical insight is needed before we can take full advantage of this vast design space to assemble nanostructures with complex form and function. Here we show how a significant part of this design space can be quickly and comprehensively understood by identifying a class of thermodynamic constraints that act on it. These thermodynamic constraints form a high-dimensional convex polyhedron that determines which nanostructures can be assembled at high equilibrium yield and reveals limitations that govern the coexistence of structures, which we verify through detailed, quantitative assembly experiments of nanoscale particles synthesized using DNA origami. Strong experimental agreement confirms the importance of the polyhedral structure and motivates its use as a predictive tool for the rational design of self-assembly. These results uncover fundamental physical relationships underpinning many-component programmable self-assembly in equilibrium and form the basis for robust inverse-design, applicable to a wide array of systems from biological protein complexes to synthetic nanomachines.</p>

Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</p>

            <p>Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.</p>

            <h2>When Homogeneous Systems Meet Dissipation and Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xixi Feng, Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Gao Xianlong, Shujie Cheng</p>
            <p>We investigate the localization and topological properties of the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in a one-dimensional homogeneous system. Our results demonstrate that, despite the absence of disorder in the initial system, the NESS can exhibit localization under bond dissipation. These dissipation-driven localization and delocalization phenomena are clearly distinguished using Wigner distributions. Furthermore, we find that the initial localization characteristics of the system significantly influence the localization properties of the NESS. Drawing upon the concept of Bose-Einstein condensate broadening in cold-atom experiments, along with experimental data, we systematically characterize the impact of bond dissipation and disorder on the localization and topological properties of the NESS. The phase diagram reveals that the NESS can be topologically non-trivial even when the initial system is topologically trivial, and that the topological triviality of the initial system strengthens the topological non-triviality of the NESS. This work provides new insights into the localization and topological phase transitions in homogeneous systems induced by bond dissipation and disorder.</p>

            <p>A new thermal bath scheme for Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg) is introduced. New game moves for sampling the given temperature are achieved via Monte Carlo dynamics of both Metropolis and Glauber in a stochastic game. This kind of approach makes the game an ideal tool for demonstrating thermal dependency of entropy production in a novel way. Using this new approach, Ising-Conway Entropy game rate of entropy production depending on different temperatures is explored. Thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and a plausible test bed for studying complex dynamical systems in classical statistical mechanics, that is conceptually simple, pedagogically accessible, yet realistic.</p>

            <p>The study of strongly correlated electron systems remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) systems hosting various exotic phases of matter including quantum spin liquids, unconventional superconductivity, and topological orders. Although Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) has established itself as a pillar for simulating one-dimensional quantum systems, its application to 2D systems has long been hindered by the notorious ``local minimum'' issues. Recent methodological breakthroughs have addressed this challenge by incorporating Gutzwiller-projected wavefunctions as initial states for DMRG simulations. This hybrid approach, referred to as DMRG guided by Gutzwiller-projected wave functions (or Gutzwiller-guided DMRG), has demonstrated remarkable improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to explore exotic quantum phases such as topological orders. This review examines the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, details key algorithmic developments, and showcases its applications in recent studies of 2D quantum systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Li, Bing Dong</p>
            <p>In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for a system composed of a spinless quantum dot coupled to two normal leads and two Majorana bound states (MBSs), utilizing the auxiliary-mode expansion method and the nonequilibrium Green function technique. Subsequently, we use these equations to analyze the linear conductance, adiabatic linear capacitance, and adiabatic linear relaxation resistance of the system. We find that when the phase difference between the two MBSs is an integer multiple of $\pi$, the MBSs enter the zero mode, leading to the complete suppression of the linear relaxation resistance. In this case, the relaxation resistance is highly sensitive to the MBSs modes. On the other hand, when the phase difference is not an integer multiple of $\pi$, the linear conductance is fully suppressed. Furthermore, the linear relaxation resistance remains completely suppressed, even when the MBSs are not in the zero mode, and the system loses its sensitivity to the MBSs modes.</p>

            <p>Flexoelectricity, polarization induced by strain gradients, is especially pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to mechanical deformation. In nanostructures with sub-nm curvature, this effect is governed by quantum-mechanical polarization and electrostatic modulation, not merely classical lattice distortion. Here, we present the first direct experimental and theoretical demonstration of large intrinsic quantum flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles, exhibiting polarization densities (P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}) that exceed those of mesoscale systems by 5 to 7 orders of magnitude. These nanowrinkles, with sub-nm radii of curvature at their apex, undergo atomic-level buckling and result in localized strain fields, as confirmed by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy. These curvatures create an asymmetry to {\pi}-orbital interactions across the atomic layer, which, in turn, leads to localized polarization densities. Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals curvature-dependent work function shifts consistent with flexoelectric polarization, while conductive atomic force microscopy detects reproducible flexoelectric currents exhibiting a threshold voltage ({\Phi}th ~1 V) that matches the band offset predicted by ab initio calculations (~1.2 V). Together, these results confirm how flexoelectric dipoles reshape the local electronic potential. Graphene nanowrinkles thus provide a pristine platform for uncovering quantum-mechanical flexoelectricity: a fundamentally ubiquitous effect, whose study in the simplest crystalline material can illuminate electromechanical behavior across condensed matter, soft matter, and biological systems.</p>

            <p>Bare Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface atoms exhibit a buckled structure where one Si atom in a dimer is lowered while the other is raised, leading to two possible buckling configurations equivalent in energy. The relatively low energy barrier between these configurations allows dimers to flip rapidly and uncontrollably unless stabilized by surface defects or observed at low temperatures due to reduced thermal energy using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). This rapid flipping results in a time-averaged symmetric appearance under STM. In this study, we investigated variable length buckled dimer wires on the hydrogenated Si(100) surface composed of silicon dangling bonds for the first time. We demonstrate that on degenerate p-type silicon at 4.5 K, the rapid switching of these dimers can be frozen at low scanning biases. Such buckled wires can however be controllably flipped using a bias pulse. A line as long as 37 dimers was repeatedly uniformly flipped by a single pulse delivered near one terminus of the wire. The tip-directed flipping of a particular wire does not switch adjacent wires, suggesting binary wires can make well isolated rewritable binary memory elements. Furthermore, at sufficiently high biases switching generates telegraph noise that could be of utility for random number generation. The integration and encapsulation of these wires with previously described silicon dangling bond-made logic gates and binary wires might allow for self contained actuation and readout without requiring any role of an STM tip.</p>

            <p>Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</p>

            <h2>Extended Structural Dynamics -- Emergent Irreversibility from Reversible Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick BarAvi</p>
            <p>The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central problem in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are constrained to dilute gases and short timescales. In this work, we introduce Extended Structural Dynamics (ESD), a deterministic framework in which irreversibility arises from the internal geometry of structured particles. In ESD, particles possess finite size and internal degrees of freedom, such as rotation and vibration, that are dynamically coupled to translational motion. This coupling induces instability, nonlinear feedback, and chaotic mixing in the extended phase space, even under time-reversal symmetric laws. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible volume of phase space, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) form measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times scaling as Trec. These results address the Loschmidt and Zermelo paradoxes without coarse-graining, randomness, or fine-tuning. We further extend the model to charged systems (cESD), where long-range electromagnetic interactions drive continuous structural coupling. ESD thus provides a deterministic and testable mechanism for emergent thermodynamic behavior, with applications ranging from mesoscopic systems to the cosmological arrow of time.</p>

            <h2>Unified Magnetoelectric Mechanism for Spin Splitting in Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Mera Acosta</p>
            <p>We identify a relativistic magnetoelectric correction that completes the theoretical description of spin splitting (SS) in magnetic systems. Derived from the Dirac equation, this term couples local magnetic moments to the scalar electric potential, providing a third fundamental mechanism, alongside Zeeman and spin-orbit coupling (SOC), that governs SS in ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and altermagnets. In compensated magnets, the correction depends on the difference in electric potential between symmetry-inequivalent motifs, $\mu_{\text{B}}(\mathcal{V}_1 - \mathcal{V}_2)\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \boldsymbol{m}$, which explains how finite SS emerges in the absence of SOC and enables a complete classification of momentum dependence and motif connectivity across all 32 point groups. Through illustrative examples, we show that distinct SS behaviors - quadratic (altermagnetic), linear (spin Zeeman effect), and $k$-independent (SS at $\Gamma$) - are specific manifestations of the proposed magnetoelectric relativistic mechanism, each governed by electric quadrupoles, dipoles, or monopoles, respectively. The formalism naturally extends to higher-order multipoles and more complex symmetries. This work establishes a unified framework for SS in magnets and provides a predictive tool for analyzing symmetry-allowed SS in magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in our recently developed MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. The enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed by analyzing the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and the stability of Li-ion in Ti-doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.</p>

            <p>We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the wealth shared in a country or the whole world is described by the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution with two conserved quantities of system wealth and norm or number of agents. This distribution depends on a dimensional parameter being the ratio of system total wealth and its dispersion range determined by highest revenues. At relatively small values of this ratio there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in such physical systems as multimode optical fibers. This leads to a huge fraction of poor households and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of S\&P500 companies at New York Stock Exchange. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</p>

            <p>Laughlin's thought experiment of quantized charge pumping is central to understanding the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) and the topological origin of its conductance quantization. Its direct experimental observation, however, has been hindered by the difficulty of realizing clean electronic edges. We address this by fabricating ultra-small, lithographically defined contacts on graphene. This creates a Corbino-equivalent system, with well-confined inner edge states. Crucially, the small contact size induces strong energy quantization of the edge states. This quantization allows us to directly resolve the spectral flow associated with Laughlin's pump. By tracing the finite-size resonances of the inner edge, we observe clear oscillations in conductance as a function of magnetic field and carrier density. The oscillation period scales with contact size, consistent with quantized charge transfer. Thus, our results provide a direct observation of the spectral flow underlying Laughlin's pump. The simplicity of the graphene platform makes this approach scalable and robust for exploring fundamental topological effects.</p>

            <p>The typical bound on parameter estimation, known as the standard quantum limit (SQL), can be surpassed by exploiting quantum resources such as entanglement. To estimate the magnetic probe field, we propose a quantum sensor based on a variable-range many-body quantum spin chain with a moderate transverse magnetic field. We report the threefold benefits of employing a long-range system as a quantum sensor. First, sensors with quasi-long-range interactions can always beat the SQL for all values of the coordination number, while a sensor with long-range interactions does not have this ubiquitous quantum advantage. Second, a long-range Hamiltonian outperforms a nearest-neighbor (NN) Hamiltonian in terms of both estimating precision and system-size scaling. Finally, we observe that the system with long-range interactions can go below the SQL in the presence of a high temperature of the initial state, while sensors having NN interactions cannot. Furthermore, a sensor based on the long-range Ising Hamiltonian proves to be robust against impurities in the magnetic field and when the time-inhomogeneous dephasing noise acts during interaction of the probe with the system.</p>

            <p>From benign overfitting in overparameterized models to rich power-law scalings in performance, simple ridge regression displays surprising behaviors sometimes thought to be limited to deep neural networks. This balance of phenomenological richness with analytical tractability makes ridge regression the model system of choice in high-dimensional machine learning. In this paper, we present a unifying perspective on recent results on ridge regression using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. We highlight the fact that statistical fluctuations in empirical covariance matrices can be absorbed into a renormalization of the ridge parameter. This `deterministic equivalence' allows us to obtain analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors in a few lines of algebra by leveraging the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. From these precise asymptotics, we can easily identify sources of power-law scaling in model performance. In all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. This allows us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antai Tao, Guangzhe Liu, Rongjing Zhang, Junhua Yuan</p>
            <p>In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, we reveal how bacteria strategically navigate these factors. We observe that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (~ 0.25). Furthermore, we find that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this two-dimensional environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.</p>

            <p>A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Christmann, Petr Ivashkov, Mattia Chiurco, Guglielmo Mazzola</p>
            <p>We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</p>

            <h2>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis Colmenarez, Seyong Kim, Markus Müller</p>
            <p>Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a 50 percent threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. Next, we perform a similar analysis for a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, the lift-connected surface code. We find a 50 percent threshold under erasure errors alone and, for the first time, derive the exact statistical mechanics mappings in the presence of both computational and erasure errors. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds for code classes beyond topological codes under realistic noise, and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</p>

            <h2>The tricritical Ising CFT and conformal bootstrap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johan Henriksson</p>
            <p>The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.</p>

            <p>For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes.

            <h2>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Calum A. Brown, Katarzyna Macieszczak, Robert L. Jack</p>
            <p>Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</p>

            <p>Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose \texttt{SineKAN}, a NQS \textit{ansatz} based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \texttt{SineKAN} wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the one dimensional Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the \texttt{SineKAN} model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state \textit{ansätze}, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP) \textit{a.k.a.} Feed Forward Neural Networks, when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. We find that \texttt{SineKAN} models can be trained to high precisions and accuracies with minimal computational costs.</p>

            <p>Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nanoscale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are promising for next-generation ultrafast optical interconnects and augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions presents significant challenges, including enhanced nonradiative surface recombination, defect and/or dislocation-related emission degradation and nanoscale pixel contact formation. In this work, we demonstrate strain-engineered nanoscale blue LED pixels fabricated via top-down nanostructuring of an all-InGaN quantum well/barrier heterostructure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on significantly low dislocation-density single-crystal GaN substrates. Sidewall passivation using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 enables excellent diode behavior, including a high rectification ratio and extremely low reverse leakage. Monte Carlo analyses suggest almost 100% yield of completely dislocation-free active regions for 450 nm nanopixels. Electroluminescence measurements show bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46%. Poisson Schrodinger simulations reveal partial strain relaxation in the QW, effectively mitigating the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE). Additionally, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm that the nanoscale geometry enhances light extraction efficiency by over 40% compared to planar designs, independent of substrate materials. These results establish a scalable pathway for dislocation free, high-brightness InGaN microLED arrays suitable for advanced display and photonic systems.</p>

            <p>Record wall-plug efficiencies in long-wavelength, nitride light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have recently been achieved in devices containing high V-pit densities. Numerical modeling suggests this may be due to improved electrical efficiencies (EE). In order to test this proposition, a novel scanning tunneling luminescence microscope (STLM) is used to map the local optoelectronic properties of commercial, green-emitting LED heterostructures around V-pits with nanoscale spatial resolution. Using the STLM tip as the hole injector, injection at the lips of V-pits is found to be drastically different from injection on the heterostructure's c-plane. A $\approx$ 3-fold improvement in internal quantum efficiency near V-pits is observed at low injection, and at higher injection a $\approx$ 1.2 V reduction in the forward bias unambiguously confirms the EE hypothesis for hole injection.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pronoy Das, Sathwik Bharadwaj, Jungho Mun, Xueji Wang, Junsuk Rho, Zubin Jacob</p>
            <p>The absence of inversion symmetry in chiral tellurium (Te) creates exotic spin textures within its electron waves. However, understanding textured optical waves within Te remains a challenge due to the semi-classical limitations of long-wavelength approximation. To unveil these textured optical waves, we develop a spin-resolved deep-microscopic optical bandstructure for Te analogous to its electronic counterpart. We demonstrate that the degeneracies in this optical bandstructure is lifted by the twisted lattice of Te, which induces optical gyrotropy. Our theory shows excellent agreement with experimental optical gyrotropy measurements. At the lattice level, we reveal that the chirality of Te manifests as deep-microscopic optical spin texture within the optical wave. Our framework uncovers the finite-momentum origin of optical activity and provides a microscopic basis for light-matter interactions in chiral crystalline materials.</p>

            <p>We report a scalable and cost-effective method for fabricating high-performance Bragg mirrors using a bottom-up approach that combines evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) and dip-coating. The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hendrik Rose, Stefan Schumacher, Torsten Meier</p>
            <p>We present a microscopic and fully quantized model to investigate the interaction between semiconductor nanostructures and quantum light fields including the many-body Coloumb interaction between photoexcited electrons and holes. Our approach describes the coupled dynamics of the quantum light field and single and double electron-hole pairs, i.e., excitons and biexcitons, and exactly accounts for Coulomb many-body correlations and carrier band dispersions. Using a simplified yet exact approach, we study a one-dimensional two-band system interacting with a single-mode, two-photon quantum state within a Tavis$\unicode{x2013}$Cummings framework. By employing an exact coherent factorization scheme, the computational complexity is reduced significantly enabling numerical simulations. We also derive a simplified model which includes only the bound $1s$-exciton and biexciton states for comparison. Our simulations reveal distinct single- and two-photon Rabi oscillations, corresponding to photon-exciton and exciton-biexciton transitions. We demonstrate, in particular, that biexciton continuum states significantly modify the dynamics in a way that cannot be captured by simplified models which consider only bound states. Our findings emphasize the importance of a comprehensive microscopic modeling in order to accurately describe quantum optical phenomena of interacting electronic many-body systems.</p>

            <p>Membranes of complex oxides like perovskite SrTiO3 extend the multi-functional promise of oxide electronics into the nanoscale regime of two-dimensional materials. Here we demonstrate that free-standing oxide membranes supply a reconfigurable platform for nano-photonics based on propagating surface phonon polaritons. We apply infrared near-field imaging and -spectroscopy enabled by a tunable ultrafast laser to study pristine nano-thick SrTiO3 membranes prepared by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy. As predicted by coupled mode theory, we find that strong coupling of interfacial polaritons realizes symmetric and antisymmetric hybridized modes with simultaneously tunable negative and positive group velocities. By resolving reflection of these propagating modes from membrane edges, defects, and substrate structures, we quantify their dispersion with position-resolved nano-spectroscopy. Remarkably, we find polariton negative dispersion is both robust and tunable through choice of membrane dielectric environment and thickness and propose a novel design for in-plane Veselago lensing harnessing this control. Our work lays the foundation for tunable transformation optics at the nanoscale using polaritons in a wide range of freestanding complex oxide membranes.</p>

            <p>The interaction between the electronic and structural degrees of freedom is central to several intriguing phenomena observed in condensed-matter physics. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom, resulting in magnetoelastic coupling, which is typically small and only detectable in macroscopic samples. Here we demonstrate a giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish an effective control of magnetism in the surface layer and utilize it to probe the impact of magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We further determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, which exhibits giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, revealing how electronic correlations result in a strong electron-lattice coupling.</p>

            <p>Water interactions with oxygen-deficient cerium dioxide (CeO$_2$) surfaces are central to hydrogen production and catalytic redox reactions, but the atomic-scale details of how defects influence adsorption and reactivity remain elusive. Here, we unveil how water adsorbs on partially reduced CeO$_{2-x}$(111) using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with chemically sensitive, oxygen-terminated probes, combined with first-principles calculations. Our AFM imaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features radically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed to molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface defects. While the experiments are carried out at cryogenic temperature, water was dosed at room temperature, capturing configurations relevant to initial adsorption events in catalytic processes. Density functional theory identifies Ce$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically favored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water orientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$ from Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures. By resolving how subsurface defects control water adsorption at the atomic scale, this work demonstrates the power of chemically selective AFM for probing site-specific reactivity in oxide catalysts, laying the groundwork for direct investigations of complex systems such as single-atom catalysts, metal-support interfaces, and defect-engineered oxides.</p>

            <p>Quantized bulk response functions are hallmark signatures of topological phases, but their manifestation in periodically driven (Floquet) systems is not yet fully established. Here, we show that two-dimensional anomalous Floquet systems exhibit a quantized bulk response encoded in a Chern-Simons axion (CSA) coupling angle, reflecting a topological magnetoelectric effect analogous to that in three-dimensional insulators. The periodic drive introduces an emergent "photon" dimension, allowing the system to be viewed as a three-dimensional Sambe lattice. Within this framework, cross-correlated responses such as photon-space polarization and magnetization density, emerge as physical signatures of the CSA coupling. The CSA angle, constructed from the non-Abelian Berry connection of Floquet states, admits a natural interpretation in terms of the geometry of hybrid Wannier states. These results provide a unified framework linking Floquet band topology to quantized bulk observables.</p>

The opposite Chern number of the two spins hinders the formation of a quantum Hall ferromagnet, instead favouring other phases. We study the phase diagram in dependence on different short-range Haldane pseudopotentials $V_m$ and uncover several phases: A fractional topological insulator, a phase separated state, a spin-polarized fractional quantum Hall state, and the partially particle-hole transformed Halperin (111) state. The effect of the pseudopotentials $V_m$ depends on the parity of $m$, the relative angular momentum.</p>

Transverse TEs require materials with a large Nernst effect, which typically requires a strong applied magnetic field. However, topological materials with magnetic order offer an alternative pathway for achieving large Nernst via the anomalous Hall effect and the accompanying anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) that arise from band topology. Here, we show that YbMnBi2 with a low Hall density and a chemical potential near the Weyl points has, to the best of our knowledge, the highest ANE-dominated Nernst thermopower of any magnetic material, with $S_{yx}$ around 110 $\mu$V/K ($T$ = 254 K, 5 T < $|\mu_0 H|$ < 9 T applied along the spin canting direction), due to the synergism between classical contributions from filled electron bands, large Hall conductivity of topological origin, and large resistivity anisotropy.

            <p>Electron interactions in quantum materials fundamentally shape their energy bands and, with them, the material's most intriguing quantum phases. Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has emerged as a model system, where flat bands give rise to a variety of such phases, yet the precise nature of these bands has remained elusive due to the lack of high-resolution momentum space probes. Here, we use the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) to directly image the interacting energy bands of MATBG with unprecedented momentum and energy resolution. Away from the magic angle, the observed bands closely follow the single-particle theory. At the magic angle, however, we observe bands that are completely transformed by interactions, exhibiting light and heavy electronic character at different parts of momentum space. Upon doping, the interplay between these light and heavy components gives rise to a variety of striking phenomena, including interaction-induced bandwidth renormalization, Mott-like cascades of the heavy particles, and Dirac revivals of the light particles. We also uncover a persistent low-energy excitation tied to the heavy sector, suggesting a new unaccounted degree of freedom. These results resolve the long-standing puzzle in MATBG - the dual nature of its electrons - by showing that it originates from electrons at different momenta within the same topological heavy fermion-like flat bands. More broadly, our results establish the QTM as a powerful tool for high-resolution spectroscopic studies of quantum materials previously inaccessible to conventional techniques.</p>

We calculate in particular the quantum depletion, the anomalous density, the condensate fluctuations, and the pair correlation function using both the time-dependent Bogoliubov approach and the self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. During their time evolution, these quantities exhibit slow or fast oscillations depending on the strength of the shielding interactions. We find that at long time scales the molecular condensate is characterized by nonequilibrium steady-state momentum distribution functions, with depletion, anomalous density and correlations that deviate from their corresponding equilibrium values. We demonstrate that the pair correlations expand diffusively at short times while they spread ballistically at long times.</p>

            <p>Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive nanomaterials for quantum information applications due to single photon emission (SPE) from atomic defects, primarily tungsten diselenide (WSe2) monolayers. Defect and strain engineering techniques have been developed to yield high purity, deterministically positioned SPE in WSe2. However, a major challenge in application of these techniques is the low temperature required to observe defect-bound TMD exciton emission, typically limiting SPE to T<30 K. SPE at higher temperatures either loses purity or requires integration into complex devices such as optical cavities. Here, 2D heterostructure engineering and molecular functionalization are combined to achieve high purity (>90%) SPE in strained WSe2 persisting to over T=90 K. Covalent diazonium functionalization of graphite in a layered WSe2/graphite heterostructure maintains high purity up to T=90 K and single-photon source integrity up to T=115 K.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shama, Jordan T. McCourt, Merve Baksi, Gleb Finkelstein, Divine Kumah</p>
            <p>Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Eu metal and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, which leads to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu adlayer leads to the formation of EuO$_x$ and the superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$. The superconducting state is quasi-two-dimensional, as evidenced by the angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage characteristics. An in-plane upper critical field B$_{c2}$ significantly exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit is observed, possibly reflecting features of Ising superconductivity. The strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high-T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>The electronic structures, magnetic transition and Fermi surface instability of room-temperature altermagnet KV$_{2}$Se$_{2}$O</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuanji Xu, Huiyuan Zhang, Maoyuan Feng, Fuyang Tian</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a distinct and fundamental class of magnetic order. Exploring its interplay with quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, density-wave instabilities, and many-body effects represents a compelling frontier. In this work, we theoretically confirm the presence of high-temperature metallic altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O. We demonstrate that the anomalous metal-insulator-metal transition arises from a Lifshitz transition associated with Fermi surface reconstruction. The previously reported spin-density wave gap is found to lie below the Fermi level in our study and is now recognized to be attributed to the V-shaped density of states, originating from orbital-selective and sublattice-resolved half-metal-like behavior on a specific V atom. Furthermore, we identify the instability from the nesting of spin-momentum-locked two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which induces the SDW state. These findings position KV$_2$Se$_2$O as a promising platform for investigating the interplay among altermagnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and density-wave order.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer a versatile platform for manipulating atomic-scale topological spin textures. In this study, using first-principles and micromagnetic calculations, we demonstrate a reversible transition between magnetic skyrmions and bimerons in a MoTeI/In_2Se_3 multiferroic heterostructure. The physical origin lies in the reorientation of the easy axis of magnetic anisotropy, triggered by the reversal of ferroelectric polarization. We show that the transition operates effectively under both static and dynamic conditions, exhibiting remarkable stability and flexibility. Notably, this transition can be achieved entirely through electric control, without requiring any external magnetic field. Furthermore, we propose a binary encoding scheme based on the skyrmion-bimeron transition, presenting a promising path toward energy-efficient spintronic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pengwei Zhao, Ryuichi Shindou</p>
            <p>Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively.</p>

            <p>In this study, we investigate the spin texture of the hourglass fermions band network in BiInO$_3$ using density functional theory (DFT) and symmetry analysis. Hourglass fermions are of interest in spintronics due to their unique and robust band structure, as well as their potential applications in novel electronic devices. BiInO$_3$ exhibits non-symmorphic crystal symmetries, such as glide reflection and glide rotational symmetry, influencing its electronic properties. Through symmetry analysis, we explore the band crossings and spin textures along specific high-symmetry paths in the Brillouin zone. Our results reveal a fascinating hourglass-shaped band dispersion and spin polarisation governed by symmetry operations and spin-orbit interaction. We analyse the spin-splitting mechanisms, including Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, and suggest potential applications for spin-based devices. This study sheds light on the role of symmetry in crystals for fascinating spin properties of hourglass fermions in non-symmorphic materials, offering insights for future developments in spintronics.</p>

We performed physical characterizations of single-molecule and self-assembled monolayer junctions of the same molecules that allowed meaningful comparisons between the Ru and Fe adducts. In the case of the Fe-containing junctions, two distinct oxidation states are present. These junctions exhibit one of the highest Seebeck coefficients (S ca. 130 {\mu}V/K) reported to date for similar systems paired with broad electric conductance distribution and limited thermal conductance. As a result, the experimental thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for Fe-containing junctions reaches up to 0.4 for junctions with relatively high conductance. This is one of the highest ZT values reported for molecular systems at room temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Swarup K. Sarkar, Sh. Mardonov, E. Ya. Sherman, Pankaj K. Mishra</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double (triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.</p>

            <p>For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.</p>

            <p>Recent studies on cavity-coupled two-dimensional electron gas demonstrate that vacuum-field engineering can tailor electronic transport properties of materials. By achieving ultra-strong coupling between a terahertz resonator and mesoscopic graphene, we demonstrate that cavity vacuum fields can alter the effective degeneracies of Landau levels, resulting in a nonlinear Landau fan diagram for massless Dirac fermions while preserving quantum-Hall quantization. Specifically, by leveraging graphene's gate-tunability, we observe that quantum-Hall features, minimum longitudinal and quantized Hall conductance for a given filling factor, occur at carrier densities reduced by more than 20 percent compared to systems without cavity. Theoretical analysis attributes this effect to the virtual cavity photon mediated transitions between the non-equidistant Landau levels in graphene, significantly reducing their effective degeneracy. This study paves the way for investigating cavity quantum electrodynamics in highly tunable, atomically thin two-dimensional crystals.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sankar Das Sarma, Katharina Laubscher, Haining Pan, Jay D. Sau, Tudor D. Stanescu</p>
            <p>One of the most important physical effects in condensed matter physics is the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), introduced in seminal works by Emmanuel Rashba. In this article, we discuss, describe, and review (providing critical perspectives on) the crucial role of RSOC in the currently active research area of topological quantum computation. Most, if not all, of the current experimental topological quantum computing platforms use the idea of Majorana zero modes as the qubit ingredient because of their non-Abelian anyonic property of having an intrinsic quantum degeneracy, which enables nonlocal encoding protected by a topological energy gap. It turns out that RSOC is a crucial ingredient in producing a low-dimensional topological superconductor in the laboratory, and such topological superconductors naturally have isolated localized midgap Majorana zero modes. In addition, increasing the RSOC strength enhances the topological gap, thus enhancing the topological immunity of the qubits to decoherence. Thus, Rashba's classic work on SOC may lead not only to the realization of localized non-Abelian anyons, but also fault tolerant quantum computation.</p>

            <p>Light dark matter candidates such as axions and dark photons generically couple to electromagnetism, yielding dark-matter-to-photon conversion as a key search strategy. In addition to resonant conversion in cavities and circuits, light dark matter bosons efficiently convert to photons on material interfaces, with a broadband power proportional to the total area of these interfaces. In this work, we make use of interface conversion to develop a new experimental dark matter detector design: the disordered dielectric detector. We show that a volume filled with dielectric powder is an efficient, robust, and broadband target for axion-to-photon or dark-photon-to-photon conversion. We perform semi-analytical and numerical studies in small-volume 2D and 3D disordered systems to compute the conversion power as a function of dark matter mass. We also discuss the power gathered onto a sensitive photodetector in terms of the bulk properties of the disordered material, making it possible to characterize the predicted dark-matter-to-photon conversion rate across a wide range of wavelengths. Finally, we propose DPHaSE: the Dielectric Powder Haloscope SNSPD Experiment which is composed of a disordered dielectric target, a veto system, and a photon collection chamber to maximize the coupling between the powder target and a low noise superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD). The projected reach, in the 10 meV-eV mass range, is sensitive to QCD axion-photon couplings and exceeds current constraints on dark photon dark matter by up to 5 orders of magnitude.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Toshali Mitra, Sukrut Mondkar, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Alexander Soloviev</p>
            <p>Semi-holography provides a formulation of dynamics in gauge theories involving both weakly self-interacting (perturbative) and strongly self-interacting (non-perturbative) degrees of freedom. These two subsectors interact via their effective metrics and sources, while the full local energy-momentum tensor is conserved in the physical background metric. In the large $N$ limit, the subsectors have their individual entropy currents, and so the full system can reach a pseudo-equilibrium state in which each subsector has a different physical temperature. We first complete the proof that the global thermal equilibrium state, where both subsectors have the \textit{same} physical temperature, can be defined in consistency with the principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Particularly, we show that the global equilibrium state is the unique state with maximum entropy in the microcanonical ensemble. Furthermore, we show that in the large $N$ limit, a \textit{typical} non-equilibrium state of the full isolated system relaxes to the global equilibrium state when the average energy density is large compared to the scale set by the inter-system coupling. We discuss quantum statistical perspectives.</p>

            <p>The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the system.</p>

            <p>Lattice arrays have been shown to have great value as simulators for complicated mathematical problems. In all physical lattices so far, coupling is only between nearest neighbors or nearest plus next-nearest neighbors; the geometry of the lattice controls the couplings of the sites. Realizing independently tunable, long-range interactions between distant condensates is a prerequisite for scalable analogue spin machines but has so far been restricted to short-range geometric coupling. In this work we show that it is possible using two-dimensional lattices of polariton condensates to use the third dimension to arbitrarily select two sites to couple coherently. Light emitted in the vertical direction from a condensate at one site can be imaged and sent back into the system to impinge on a different condensate at an arbitrary distance. We demonstrate this for the case of two condensates, in which we first ensure that they have no coupling within the plane of the lattice, and then use external imaging to phase lock the two together. Phase-resolved interferometry confirms clearly visible interference fringes and deterministic phase locking even when direct, planar coupling is suppressed. Analytical modeling reveals complementary mechanisms underpinning the robust coherence. Because the mirror adds no cameras, modulators, or electronic processing, the condensate pair operates as a pure, high-bandwidth analog element. Extension to dense graphs via segmented micro-mirror arrays is therefore ultimately limited only by the field of view and numerical aperture of the imaging optics. Our scheme thus paves the way to reconfigurable, energy-efficient polaritonic hardware for optimization, classification, clustering, and other neuromorphic tasks at the speed of light.</p>

            <p>We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) of non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The method, which represents an alternative to Girko Hermitization approach, is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we apply it to consider two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we discuss the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a possible generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.</p>

            <p>Gem-dicarbonyls of transition metals supported on metal (oxide) surfaces are common intermediates in heterogeneous catalysis. While infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a standard tool for detecting these species on applied catalysts, the ill-defined crystallographic environment of species observed on powder catalysts renders data interpretation challenging. In this work, we apply a multi-technique surface science approach to investigate rhodium gem-dicarbonyls on a single-crystalline rutile TiO$_2$(110) surface. We combine spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to determine their location and coordination on the surface. IR spectroscopy shows the successful creation of gem-dicarbonyls on a titania single crystal by exposing deposited Rh atoms to CO gas, followed by annealing to 200-250 K. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) data reveal that these complexes are mostly aligned along the [001] crystallographic direction, corroborating theoretical predictions. Notably, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data reveal multiple rhodium species on the surface, even when the IR spectra show only the signature of rhodium gem-dicarbonyls. As such, our results highlight the complex behavior of carbonyls on metal oxide surfaces, and demonstrate the necessity of multi-technique approaches for the adequate characterization of single-atom catalysts.</p>

            <p>Lattice vibrations within crystalline solids, or phonons, provide information on a variety of important material characteristics, from thermal qualities to optical properties and phase transition behaviour. When the material contains light ions, or is subjected to sufficiently low temperatures and/or high pressures, anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) may significantly alter its phonon characteristics. Unfortunately, accurate inclusion of these two effects within numerical simulations typically incurs a substantial computational cost. In this work, we present a novel approach which promises to mitigate this problem. The scheme leverages the recently introduced quantum correlators approach for the extraction of anharmonic phonon frequencies from molecular dynamics data. To account for NQEs without excessive increase of the computational cost, we include nuclear quantum effects via the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method. This is the first full exploration of the use of QTB for the calculation of phonon dispersion relations. We demonstrate the noteworthy efficiency and accuracy of the scheme, and analyze its upsides and drawbacks by first considering 1-dimensional systems, and then the physically interesting case of solid neon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Serge Galam</p>
            <p>I address the challenge of extracting reliable insights from large datasets using a simplified model that illustrates how hierarchical classification can distort outcomes. The model consists of discrete pixels labeled red, blue, or white. Red and blue indicate distinct properties, and white represents unclassified or ambiguous data. A macro-color is assigned only if one color holds a strict majority among the pixels. Otherwise, the aggregate is labeled white, reflecting uncertainty. This setup mimics a percolation threshold at fifty percent. Assuming direct access of the various proportions of colors is infeasible from the data, I implement a hierarchical coarse-graining procedure. Elements (first pixels, then aggregates) are recursively grouped and reclassified via local majority rules, producing ultimately a single super-aggregate whose color represents the inferred macro-property of the collection of pixels as a whole. Analytical results, supported by simulations, show that the process introduces additional white aggregates beyond white pixels, which could be initially present. These arise from groups lacking a clear majority, requiring arbitrary symmetry-breaking decisions to attribute a color to them. While each local resolution may appear minor and inconsequential, their repetitions introduce a growing systematic bias. Even with complete data, unavoidable asymmetries in local rules are shown to skew outcomes. This study highlights a critical limitation of recursive data reduction. Insight extraction is shaped not only by data quality, but by how local ambiguity is handled. That results in built-in biases. Thus, the related flaws are not due to the data, but due to structural choices made during local aggregations. Though based on a simple model, the findings expose the high likelihood of inherent flaws in widely used hierarchical classification techniques.</p>

We provide a simple and efficient algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point $\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma -\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition.

            <p>Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings, alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion, typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and, more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance. Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging molecular quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p>Can there be multiple bulk theories for the same boundary theory? We answer this affirmatively in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model using the tools of constrained systems. We find different symmetry sectors generated by specific constraints within the chord Hilbert space of the DSSYK with matter. Each sector corresponds to a different bulk description. These include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (as a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy chord) used in de Sitter holography. We derive the partition functions and thermal correlation functions in the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems from the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</p>

For such a computation of the covariance, in comparison to previous work for computations of the log-gas covariance, we obtain a formula between two linear statistics, given arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$ over the real line, that is dependent upon an asymptotic approximation of the Jellium probability distribution function from large $N$ deviations, and from an effective saddle-point action.</p>

            <h2>Effective K valley Hamiltonian for TMD bilayers under pressure and application to twisted bilayers with pressure-induced topological phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miftah Hadi Syahputra Anfa, Sabri Elatresh, Hocine Bahlouli, Michael Vogl</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent studies on topologically non-trivial moiré bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study MoTe$_2$ bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering an untwisted bilayer system with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data were then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then apply our model to a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers - here, we assume rigid layers, which is a crucial simplification. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.</p>

            <h2>Detection of Majorana zero modes bound to Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katharina Laubscher, Jay D. Sau</p>
            <p>We study signatures of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) bound to Josephson vortices in superconductor-three-dimensional topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junctions placed in a perpendicular magnetic field. First, using semiclassical analytical as well as numerical techniques, we calculate the spatially resolved supercurrent density carried by the low-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in the junction. Motivated by a recent experiment [Yue et al., Phys. Rev. B 109, 094511 (2024)], we discuss if and how the presence of vortex MZMs is reflected in supercurrent measurements, showing that Fraunhofer signatures alone are not suitable to reliably detect vortex MZMs. Next, we propose two ways in which we believe supercurrent measurements could be complemented to further verify that the junction does indeed host MZMs. Explicitly, we discuss how additional Majorana signatures could be obtained by (1) mapping out the local density of states in the junction via scanning tunneling microscopy techniques, and (2) microwave spectroscopy of the spectrum of low-energy CdGM states in the junction.</p>

Second by computing the nonequilibrium conductance of the CRN directly. The two approaches coincide, as expected from our theory of thermodynamic circuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fabrizio Canfora, Pablo Pais</p>
            <p>A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</p>

            <h2>Negative exchange interaction in Si quantum dot arrays via valley-phase induced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin D. Woods</p>
            <p>The exchange interaction $J$ offers a powerful tool for quantum computation based on semiconductor spin qubits. However, the exchange interaction in two-electron systems in the absence of a magnetic field is usually constrained to be non-negative $J \geq 0$, which inhibits the construction of various dynamically corrected exchange-based gates. In this work, we show that negative exchange $J < 0$ can be realized in two-electron Si quantum dot arrays in the absence of a magnetic field due to the presence of the valley degree of freedom. Here, valley phase differences between dots produce a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field in the low-energy effective theory, which in turn can lead to a negative exchange interaction. In addition, we show that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field can break Nagaoka ferromagnetism and be engineered by altering the occupancy of the dot array. Therefore, our work uncovers new tools for exchange-based quantum computing and a novel setting for studying quantum magnetism.</p>

            <h2>Floquet-engineered diode performance in a Majorana-quantum dot Josephson junction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koustav Roy, Gourab Paul, Debika Debnath, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>We study nonreciprocal signatures of Josephson current (JC) in a quantum dot (QD)-based Josephson junction (JJ) that comprises of two periodically driven Kitaev chains (KCs) coupled with an intervening QD. The simultaneous breaking of the inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{IS}$) and the time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{TRS}$), indispensable for the Josephson diode effect (JDE), is achieved solely via the two Floquet drives that differ by a finite phase, which eventually results in a nonreciprocal current, and hence yields a finite JDE. It may be noted that the Floquet Majorana modes generated at both the far ends of the KCs (away from the QD) and adjacent to the QD junctions mediate the JC owing to a finite superconducting (SC) phase difference in the two KCs. We calculate the time-averaged JC and inspect the tunability of the current-phase relation (CPR) to ascertain the diode characteristics. The asymmetric Floquet drive also manifests an anomalous JC signature in our KC-QD-KC JJ. Furthermore, additional control over the QD energy level can be achieved via an external gate voltage that renders flexibility for the Josephson diode (JD) to act as an SC switching device. Tuning different system parameters, such as the chemical potential of the KCs, Floquet frequency, the relative phase mismatch of the drives, and the gate voltage, our model shows the highest possible rectification to be around $70\%$. Summarizing, our study provides an alternative scenario, replacing the traditional usage of an external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling effects in a JD via asymmetrically driven Kitaev leads that entail Majorana-mediated transport.</p>

            <p>The BEDT-TTF (BEDT-TTF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafuvalene) based Mott insulators of the form $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$X (X=Br,Cl) host a correlated electron system on a triangular lattice of (BEDT-TTF)$^{+1}_2$ dimers. Each dimer lattice site carries one hole and one S=1/2 spin which interacts antiferromagnetically. Anionic substitution has been shown to tune across a charge order transition, where unequal share of the hole between the molecules of a dimer site results in electronic ferroelectricity. We demonstrate successful tuning across the charge order transition via uniaxial strain. We use Raman scattering spectroscopy to study the local charge state and collective dipole fulctuations. We induce charge order at 33 K in the quantum dipole liquid material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Br through application of tensile strain of 0.4% along the c-axis. We suppress charge order down to 10 K in $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Hg(SCN)$_2$Cl by applying a tensile strain of 1.6% along the b-axis. We identify the softening of collective dipole fluctuations through the charge order transition, consistent with electronic ferroelectricity.

            <h2>Characterizing the Hyperuniformity of Disordered Network Metamaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Emmett Maher, Katherine A. Newhall</p>
            <p>Advancements in materials design and manufacturing have allowed for the production of ordered and disordered metamaterials with diverse and novel properties. Hyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials, which anomalously suppress density fluctuations on large length scales compared to typical disordered systems, and network materials are two classes of metamaterial that have desirable physical properties. Recent focus has been placed on the design of disordered hyperuniform network metamaterials that inherit the desirable properties of both of these metamaterial classes. In this work, we focus on determining the extent to which network structures derived from the spatial tessellations of hyperuniform point patterns inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point patterns. In particular, we examine the Delaunay, Voronoi, Delaunay-Centroidal, and Gabriel tessellations of nonhyperuniform and hyperuniform point patterns in two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space. We use the spectral density to characterize the density fluctuations of two-phase media created by thickening the edges of these tessellations in two dimensions and introduce a novel variance-based metric to characterize the network structures directly in two and three dimensions. We find that, while none of the tessellations completely inherit the hyperuniformity of the progenitor point pattern, the degree to which the hyperuniformity is inherited is sensitive to the tessellation scheme and the short- and long-range translational disorder in the point pattern, but not to the choice of beam shape when mapping the networks into two-phase media.</p>

In the higher-temperature antiferromagnetic phase within the range $T_{\rm s2}=8~{\rm K}<T<T_{\rm N}$, an out-of-plane component of the antiferromagnetic moment may or may not be present.

Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology.

In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</p>

            <h2>A General Approach to the Shape Transition of Run-and-Tumble Particles: The 1D PDMP Framework for Invariant Measure Regularity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leo Hahn</p>
            <p>Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) have emerged as a paradigmatic example for studying nonequilibrium phenomena in statistical mechanics. The invariant measure of a wide class of RTPs subjected to a potential possesses a density that is continuous at high tumble rates but exhibits divergences at low ones. This key feature, known as shape transition, constitutes a qualitative indicator of the relative closeness (continuous density) or strong deviation (diverging density) from the equilibrium setting. Furthermore, the points at which the density diverges correspond to the configurations where the system spends most of its time in the low tumble rate regime. Building on and extending existing results concerning the regularity of the invariant measure of one-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), we show how to characterize the shape transition even in situations where the invariant measure cannot be computed explicitly. Our analysis confirms shape transition as a robust, general feature of RTPs subjected to a potential. We also refine the regularity theory for the invariant measure of one-dimensional PDMPs.</p>

We study the phase diagram of the trilayer Ising superconductor NbSe$_2$ in the in-plane magnetic field, taking into ac count the orbital effect, the paramagnetic effect, and the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-momentum gap structure in the high-field region is shown by a large-scale numerical calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We find an exotic superconducting phase, a layer-selective FFLO phase, in which finite-momentum Cooper pairs coexist with zero-momentum Cooper pairs, separated from the orbital FFLO phase.</p>

            <p>Much of our knowledge of quantum systems is encapsulated in the expectation value of Hermitian operators, experimentally obtained by averaging projective measurements. However, dynamical properties are often described by products of operators evaluated at different times; such observables cannot be measured by individual projective measurements, which occur at a single time. For example, the dynamical structure factor describes the propagation of density excitations, such as phonons, and is derived from the spatial density operator evaluated at different times. Conventionally, this is measured by first exciting the system at a specific wavevector and frequency, then measuring the response. Here, we describe an alternative approach using a pair of time-separated weak measurements, and analytically show that their cross-correlation function directly recovers the dynamical structure factor. We provide numerical confirmation of this technique with a matrix product states simulation of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, weakly measured by phase contrast imaging. We explore the limits of the method and demonstrate its applicability to real experiments with limited imaging resolution.</p>

            <p>Recent progress in manipulating individual quantum systems enables the exploration of engines exploiting non-classical resources. One of the most appealing is the energy provided by the inherent backaction of quantum measurements. While a handful of experiments have investigated the inner dynamics of engines fueled by measurement backaction, powering a useful task by such an engine is missing. Here we demonstrate the amplification of microwave signals by an engine fueled by repeated quantum measurements of a superconducting transmon qubit. Using feedback, the engine acts as a quantum Maxwell demon operating without a hot thermal source. Measuring the gain of this amplification constitutes a direct probing of the work output of the engine, in contrast with inferring the work by measuring the qubit state along its evolution. Observing a good agreement between both work estimation methods, our experiment validates the accuracy of the indirect method. We characterize the long-term stability of the engine as well as its robustness to transmon decoherence, loss and drifts. Our experiment exemplifies a practical usage of the energy brought by quantum measurement backaction.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional, can be a promising probe of the measurement-induced phase.</p>

            <p>Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.</p>

            <p>Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</p>

            <p>Pair density modulation is a superconducting state, recently observed in exfoliated iron-based superconductor flakes, in which the superconducting gap oscillates strongly with the same periodicity as the underlying crystalline lattice. We propose a microscopic model that explains this modulation through a combination of glide-mirror symmetry breaking and the emergence of nematic superconductivity. The first ingredient results in a sublattice texture on the Fermi surface, which is aligned with the anisotropic superconducting gap of the nematic $s_\pm+d$ state. This gives rise to distinctive gap maxima and minima located on the two inequivalent iron sublattices while still being a zero-momentum pairing state. We discuss how further investigation of such modulations can give insight into the nature of the superconducting pairing, such as the signs of the order parameters and visualization of a phase transition to a mixed two-component state using local probes.</p>

            <p>The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</p>

By classifying over a dozen boron nanostructures, including B$_{12}$, B$_{40}$, B$_{65}$, B$_{80}$, and B$_{92}$, according to their local atomic environments (4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination), we identify clear trends in structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetism. A universal energetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = a/n^b + E_c^{sheet}$ (with $b \approx 1$) captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases. Notably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select cages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the $\chi_3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\alpha$-sheet, and B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO-LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g = 1.78$ eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14 eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity of their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin polarization ($M = 3 \, \mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for designing boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are further validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage. This work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap for the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.</p>

            <h2>Quantum dot energy levels in bilayer graphene: Exact and approximate study</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. Giavaras</p>
            <p>In bilayer graphene the exact energy levels of quantum dots can be derived from the four-component continuum Hamiltonian. Here, we study the quantum dot energy levels with approximate equations and compare them with the exact levels. The starting point of our approach is the four-component continuum model and the quantum dot is defined by a continuous potential well in a uniform magnetic field. Using some simple arguments we demonstrate realistic regimes where approximate quantum dot equations can be derived. Interestingly these approximate equations can be solved semi-analytically, in the same context as a single-component Schrödinger equation. The approximate equations provide valuable insight into the physics with minimal numerical effort compared with the four-component quantum dot model. We show that the approximate quantum dot energy levels agree very well with the exact levels in a broad range of parameters and find realistic regimes where the relative error is vanishingly small.</p>

            <h2>Observation of Berry Curvature-Enhanced Anomalous Photo-Nernst Effect in Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</h2>

            <p>The anomalous Nernst effect is the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect, which can emerge in magnetic materials or topological materials without magnetic field. Such effect is critical to both fundamental topological physics and various application fields, including energy harvesting, spintronics and optoelectronics. In this work, we observe the anomalous photo-Nernst effect, which use light excitation to generate temperature gradients for the thermoelectric response. Our experiments reveal a pronounced edge photocurrent response in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 under zero magnetic field, originating from the anomalous photo-Nernst effect. The pronounced photo-Nernst current benefits from the exceptional properties of Co3Sn2S2, including the large thermoelectric coefficient, topologically enhanced anomalous response of Weyl bands and the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation. Furthermore, by comparing the nominal anomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe a clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the topological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our results reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in magnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental physics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.</p>

            <p>MXenes and MBenes, which are two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides and borides, have been extensively studied for their impressive properties. Recently, we reported a family of transition metal sulfides MSene (M2S) with rich properties [Phys. Rev. B 111, L041404 (2025)], it is worth studying whether selenides with similar structure also have rich properties. In this work, through high-throughput screening, we present a novel family of 2D transition metal selenides, M2Se. In this family, there are fifty-eight candidate materials, of which ten are stable and metallic. Notably, eight exhibit superconductivity, among which four are superconducting topological metals. Besides, eight show charge density wave (CDW) behavior, among which five also exhibit antiferromagnetism. It is revealed that CDW originates from electron-phonon coupling rather than Fermi surface nesting. Moreover, strain can be applied to regulate the competition between CDW and superconductivity. Our findings reveal the rich properties of superconductivity, band topology, CDW, and magnetism in M2Se, providing a new platform for the controllable integration of multifunctional quantum states.</p>

            <p>The crystallization of charge carriers, dubbed the Wigner crystal, is anticipated at low densities in clean two-dimensional electronic systems (2DES). While there has been extensive investigation across diverse platforms, probing spontaneous charge and spin ordering is hindered by disorder effects and limited interaction energies. Here, we report transport evidence for Wigner crystals with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in high-quality, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated monolayer MoTe2, a system that achieves a large interaction parameter (r_s) at proper hole densities. A density-tuned metal-insulator transition (MIT) occurring at 3.1E10^11 cm-2 (corresponding to r_s~32) and pronounced nonlinear charge transport in the insulating regime at low temperatures signify the formation of Wigner crystals. Thermal melting of the crystalline phase is observed below approximately 2 K via temperature-dependent nonlinear transport. Magnetoresistance measurements further reveal a substantial enhancement of spin susceptibility as approaching the MIT. The temperature dependence of spin susceptibility in the Wigner crystal phase closely follows the Curie-Weiss law, with the extracted negative Weiss constant illustrating antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, we have found the system exhibits metallic-like differential resistivity under finite DC bias, possibly indicating the existence of a non-equilibrium coherent state in the depinning of Wigner crystals. Our observations establish monolayer MoTe2 as a promising platform for exploring magnetic and dynamic properties of Wigner crystals.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kensei Ushio, Shu Kamiyama, Yuto Hoshi, Ryota Mizuno, Masayuki Ochi, Kazuhiko Kuroki, Hirofumi Sakakibara</p>
            <p>We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals heterostructures have been used to tailor atomic layers into various artificial materials through interactions at heterointerfaces. The interplay between the band gap created by the band folding of the interfacial potential and the band inversion driven by enhanced spin-orbit interaction (SOI) through band hybridization enables us to realize a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D-TI). Here we report the realization of graphene 2D-TIs by epitaxial growth of three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) BiSbTeSe$_2$ ultrathin films on graphene. By increasing the BiSbTeSe$_2$ thickness from 2 nm to 9 nm to enhance SOI on graphene, the electronic state is altered from the trivial Kekul${é}$ insulator to the 2D-TI. The nonlocal transport reveals the helical edge conduction which survives up to 200 K at maximum. Our graphene 2D-TI is stable, easy to make electrical contacts, and of high quality. It offers various applications including spin-current conversion and platforms for Majorana fermions in junctions to superconductors.</p>

            <p>We investigate the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement in a triangular spin-qubit system due to spatially correlated noise. In particular, we demonstrate how the formation of a highly entangled dark state -- a W state -- enables robust, long-lived tripartite entanglement. Surprisingly, we find that environmentally induced coherent coupling does not play a crucial role in sustaining this entanglement. This contrasts sharply with the two-qubit case, where the induced coupling significantly influences the entanglement dynamics. Furthermore, we explore two promising approaches to enhance the tripartite entanglement by steering the system towards the dark state: post-selection and coherent driving. Our findings offer a robust method for generating high-fidelity tripartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Rein, Marcin Raczkowski, Zhenjiu Wang, Toshihiro Sato, Fakher F. Assaad</p>
            <p>Topology plays a cardinal role in explaining phases and quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In this study, we formulate a set of models of Dirac fermions in 2+1 dimensions with SU($N$)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry that have the potential to host critical points described by field theories with topological terms. For $N=2$ it shows a rich phase diagram containing semimetallic, quantum spin Hall insulating, Kekulé valence bond solid and s-wave superconducting phases and features multiple Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson phase transitions driven by interaction strength. At $N=1$ a deconfined quantum critical point is observed. At $N=2$ one expects the critical theory to correspond to a level 2 Wess-Zumino-Witten theory in 2+1 dimensions. Here the numerical results however show a strong first order transition. Another transition can be governed by a topological $\theta$-term which is rendered irrelevant for even values of $N$ thus leading to Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson behaviour.</p>

            <p>In light of recent experimental data indicating a substantial thermal Hall effect in square lattice antiferromagnetic Mott insulators, we investigate whether a simple Mott insulator can sustain a finite thermal Hall effect. We verify that the answer is "no" if one performs calculations within a spin-only low-energy effective spin model with non-interacting magnons. However, by performing determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show the single-band $t$-$t'$-$U$ Hubbard model coupled to an orbital magnetic field does support a finite thermal Hall effect when $t' \neq 0$ and $B \neq 0$ in the Mott insulating phase. We argue that the (carrier agnostic) necessary conditions for observing a finite thermal Hall effect are time-reversal and particle-hole symmetry breaking. By considering magnon-magnon scattering using a semi-classical Boltzmann analysis, we illustrate a physical mechanism by which finite transverse thermal conductivity may arise, consistent with our symmetry argument and numerical results. Our results contradict the conventional wisdom that square and triangular lattices with SU(2) symmetry do not support a finite thermal Hall effect and call for a critical re-examination of thermal Hall effect data in insulating magnets, as the magnon contribution should not be excluded a priori.</p>

            <p>This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.</p>

            <h2>Ionic-bond-driven atom-bridged room-temperature Cooper pairing in cuprates and nickelates: a theoretical framework supported by 32 experimental evidences</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jun-jie Shi, Yao-hui Zhu</p>
            <p>Unlike ordinary conductors and semiconductors, which conduct electricity through individual electrons, superconductors usually conduct electricity through pairs of electrons, known as Cooper pairs. Even after 4 decades of intense study, no one knows what holds electrons together in complex high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprates and nickelates. Here, targeting the critical challenge of the pairing mechanism behind high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity in oxides, we create a new theoretical framework by standing on the foundation of the chemical-bond$\rightarrow$structure$\rightarrow$property relationship. Considering the dominance of eV-scale ionic bonding, affinity of O$^-$ (1.46 eV) and O$^{2-}$ (-8.08 eV) and large second ionization energy ($\sim$10-20 eV) of metal atoms, we propose a groundbreaking idea of electron e$^-$ (hole h$^+$) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, i.e., the ionic-bond-driven e$^-$-O-e$^-$ (h$^+$-M-h$^+$) itinerant Cooper pairing, by following the principle of "tracing electron footprints to explore pairing mechanisms". Its correctness and universality are confirmed by 32 diverse experimental evidences, especially, the STM topographic image combining with small Cooper-pair size. Any other sub-eV and covalent-binding pairing mechanisms would be doubtful. Our findings resolve a 40-year puzzle of the microscopic mechanism for high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity and validate the feasibility of room-temperature carrier-pairing in ionic-bonded superconductors, bringing the dream of room-temperature superconductivity one step closer.</p>

            <p>We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansätze.</p>

This technique enables the deterministic induction of single folds in graphene with fold dimensions, width and height in the hundreds of nanometers, tunable through the geometry of the polymer cavities and the applied strain. Importantly, these folds are reversible, returning to a flat morphology with minimal structural damage, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, our method allows for the creation of fields of folds with reproducible periodicity, defining clear potential for practical applications.

            <h2>Bootstrapping Flat-band Superconductors: Rigorous Lower Bounds on Superfluid Stiffness</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qiang Gao, Zhaoyu Han, Eslam Khalaf</p>
            <p>The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However, accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration free models with superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple intra-unit-cell magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness. Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on the structure of these models. Straight-forward generalization of the method can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches. Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities beyond energy.</p>

            <p>We integrate concepts from topological band theory and strong-correlation physics with the principle of orbital symmetry conservation, which characterizes reactions as symmetry allowed or forbidden based on whether molecular orbitals cross along the reaction coordinate. Using a $4\pi$ electrocyclization as an example, we show how Green's functions generalize the concepts of symmetry allowed and symmetry forbidden reactions even in the presence of strong multi-reference correlations. We demonstrate how symmetry forbidden reactions are characterized by strong multi-reference correlations, resulting in crossings of Green's function zeros rather than poles as MO-theory would predict. Taking into account Green's functions zeros, a topological invariant is introduced that captures symmetry protected crossings of poles or zeros. We discuss the effects of symmetry breaking and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be generalized to reactions involving different spin states or to excited states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhiqiang Wang, Ke Wang, K. Levin</p>
            <p>There should be no question that magnetism and superconductivity appear in close proximity in many if not most of the unconventional superconductors. These two phases are importantly correlated: the strongest manifestations of this superconducting pairing are generally associated with the weakest magnetism. It is often stated that this behavior results from a quantum critical point (QCP), although not all such superconductors fit into this category. In this paper we consider a second scenario for addressing these proximity phenomena in which no QCP is present. Although there are other examples for this latter category, most notable are those associated with very strongly paired superconductors that have insulating and magnetically ordered ``parent" materials. Here, too, one finds that ``failed" long range order is key to establishing superconductivity. This leads to the general question, which is the focus of this paper. Why, and how, in either of these contexts, does this proximal magnetism play a constructive role in helping to stabilize superconductivity? Our understanding here should help pave the way towards the discovery of new families of superconductors, which are expected to emerge on the brink of magnetism.</p>

            <p>We investigated the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density-matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to graphene whose fishbone-shaped spectra primarily oscillates at twice the frequency of the pump laser, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits a first-order harmonic component induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into this interesting results, we employ a simplified model that considers only the nonequivalent electrons at $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points in the Brillouin zone. This model allows us to derive an analytical expression for the ATAS contribution stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, and reveal that the first-order harmonic component of spectra arises ont only from the Berry connections but also from the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.</p>

The discovery of record-breaking values of $T_c$ in quite a number of hydrides under high pressure was an impressive demonstration of capabilities of electron-phonon mechanism of Cooper pairing. This lead to an increased interest on possible limitations of Eliashberg-McMillan theory as the main theory of superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. We shall consider some basic conclusions following from this theory and present some remarks on the limit of very strong electron-phonon coupling. We shall discuss possible limitations on the value of the coupling constant related to possible lattice and specific heat instability and conclude that within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant may acquire very large values. Finally we discuss some bounds for $T_c$ derived in the strong coupling limit and propose an elementary estimate of an upper limit for $T_c$, expressed via combination of fundamental physical constants.</p>

By combining scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy with density functional theory, we analyze the emergence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in single Gd atoms and Gd dimers and uncover the underlying magnetic interaction mechanisms, on the basis of which we predict by means of spin-dynamics simulations the formation of stable chiral Néel-type spin-spiral configurations in Gd chains. These findings highlight rare-earth magnets as a promising platform for precisely tuning spin-spiral ground states, an essential prerequisite for the realization of topological superconductivity.</p>

            <h2>Valley resolved optical spectroscopy and coherent excitation of quantum Hall edge states in graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ashutosh Singh, Maria Sebastian, Mikhail Tokman, Alexey Belyanin</p>
            <p>We show that chiral edge states in graphene under Quantum Hall effect conditions can be selectively probed and excited by terahertz or infrared radiation with single-quasiparticle sensitivity without affecting bulk states. Moreover, valley-selective excitation of edge states is possible with high fidelity. The underlying physical mechanism is the inevitable violation of adiabaticity and inversion symmetry breaking for electron states near the edge. This leads to the formation of Landau level-specific and valley-specific absorbance spectral peaks that are spectrally well separated from each other and from absorption by the bulk states, and have different polarization selection rules. Furthermore, inversion symmetry breaking enables coherent driving of chiral edge photocurrents due to second-order nonlinear optical rectification which becomes allowed in the electric dipole approximation.</p>

            <p>Within the Gross-Pitaevskii framework, we reveal the emergence of a crystallized phase of an exciton condensate in an atomically-thin anisotropic semiconductor, where screening of exciton-exciton interactions is introduced by a proximal doped graphene layer. While such screened interactions are expected to yield a hexagonal crystal lattice in the excitonic condensate in isotropic semiconductor quantum wells [see e.g. Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 060401 (2012)], here we show that for atomically thin semiconductors with strong electronic anisotropy, such as few-layer black phosphorus, the crystallized exciton phase acquires a parallel stripe structure - unanticipated to date. The optimal conditions for the emergence of this phase, as well as for its coexistence with excitonic superfluidity in a striped supersolid phase, are identified.</p>

            <p>Finite-momentum superconductivity has become an important research topic in condensed matter physics. In particular, the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is stabi lized in atomically thin films by the orbital effect of an external magnetic field, has been getting attention as a fascinating finite-momentum superconducting state recently. We study the phase diagram of the trilayer Ising superconductor NbSe$_2$ in the in-plane magnetic field, taking into ac count the orbital effect, the paramagnetic effect, and the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-momentum gap structure in the high-field region is shown by a large-scale numerical calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We find an exotic superconducting phase, a layer-selective FFLO phase, in which finite-momentum Cooper pairs coexist with zero-momentum Cooper pairs, separated from the orbital FFLO phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michèle Jakob, Katharina Laubscher, Patrick Del Vecchio, Anasua Chatterjee, Valla Fatemi, Stefano Bosco</p>
            <p>Spin qubits in semiconducting quantum dots are currently limited by slow readout processes, which are orders of magnitude slower than gate operations. In contrast, Andreev spin qubits benefit from fast measurement schemes enabled by the large resonator couplings of superconducting qubits but suffer from reduced coherence during qubit operations. Here, we propose fast and high-fidelity measurement protocols based on an electrically-tunable coupling between quantum dot and Andreev spin qubits. In realistic devices, this coupling can be made sufficiently strong to enable high-fidelity readout well below microseconds, potentially enabling mid-circuit measurements. Crucially, the electrical tunability of our coupler permits to switch it off during idle periods, minimizing crosstalk and measurement back-action. Our approach is fully compatible with germanium-based devices and paves the way for scalable quantum computing architectures by leveraging the advantages of heterogeneous qubit implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joseph Gibson, Victor Drouin-Touchette, Stefanos Kourtis</p>
            <p>We propose a quantum algorithm for approximately counting the number of solutions to planar 2-satisfiability (2SAT) formulas natively on neutral atom quantum computers. Our algorithm maps Boolean variables to atomic registers arranged in space according to a given formula, so that 2SAT constraints are enforced via the Rydberg blockade between neighboring atoms. A quench under Rydberg dynamics of an initial computational basis state produces a superposition of all solutions after a sufficiently long evolution. For almost uniform superpositions, a polynomial number of measurements is enough to estimate the solution count up to any constant multiplicative factor via sampling based counting. We demonstrate numerically that this protocol leads to almost uniform solution sampling in 1D and 2D grids and that it produces accurate counts for 2SAT instances on punctured grids, suggesting its general applicability as a heuristic for #P-complete problems.</p>

            <h2>Interplay between Symmetry Breaking and Interactions in a Symmetry Protected Topological Phase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Parameshwar R. Pasnoori, Patrick Azaria</p>
            <p>We solve the one dimensional massive Thirring model or equivalently the sine-Gordon model in the repulsive regime with general Dirichlet boundary conditions, which are characterized by two boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}$ associated with the left and right boundaries respectively. In the presence of these boundary fields, which explicitly break the charge conjugation symmetry, the system exhibits a duality symmetry which changes the sign of the mass parameter $m_0$ and shifts the values of the boundary fields by $\phi_{L,R}\rightarrow \phi_{L,R}+\pi$. When the mass parameter $m_0<0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, or equivalently due to duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0>0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, the system is at a trivial point. Here, the ground state is unique just as in the case of periodic boundary conditions. In contrast, when the mass parameter $m_0<0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=\pi$, and equivalently due to the duality symmetry, when the mass parameter $m_0>0$ and the boundary fields $\phi_{L,R}=0$, the system is at a topological point where it exhibits a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, which is characterized by the existence of zero energy bound states at both the boundaries. For a given value of the mass parameter $m_0$, we find that these phases remain stable in the presence of symmetry breaking fields at the boundary, provided they are smaller than certain critical values which depend on the strength of the interactions in the bulk. Hence, we show that the stability of the SPT and trivial phases depends on the interplay of the symmetry breaking boundary field values and the bulk interaction strength.</p>

            <p>High-efficiency single-photon detection in the microwave domain is a key enabling technology for quantum sensing, communication, and information processing. However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\mu}eV) presents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion as achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable energy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single photons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an efficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system comprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction (JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to maximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon coupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons coherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable electrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion. Moreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition energy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system efficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based cavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient microwave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics and hybrid quantum information technologies.</p>

            <p>La doped SrFeO$_{3}$, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$, exhibits a metal-to-insulator transition accompanied by both antiferromagnetic and charge ordering states along with the Fe-O bond disproportionation below a critical temperature near 200K. Unconventionally slow charge dynamics measured in this material near the critical temperature shows that its excited charge ordering states can exhibit novel electronic structures with nontrivial energy profiles. Here, we reveal possible metastable states of charge ordering structures in La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ using the first-principle and climbing image nudged elastic band methods. In the strong correlation regime, La$_{1/3}$Sr$_{2/3}$FeO$_{3}$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a charge ordering state of the big-small-big pattern, consistent with the experimental measurement of this material at the low temperature. As the correlation effect becomes weak, we find at least two possible metastable charge ordering states with the distinct Fe-O bond disproportionation. Remarkably, a ferroelectric metallic state emerges with the small energy barrier of $\sim$7 meV, driven by a metastable CO state of the small-medium-big pattern. The electronic structures of these metastable charge ordering states are noticeably different from those of the ground-state. Our results can provide an insightful explanation to multiple metastable charge ordering states and the slow charge dynamics of this and related oxide materials.</p>

            <p>The component of the resistivity tensor $\rho_{ij}$ corresponding to voltage transverse to both an applied current and a magnetic field can be separated into odd and even parts with respect to the applied magnetic field. The former contains information, for example, about the ordinary or anomalous Hall effect. The latter is often ascribed to experimental artefacts and ignored. Here, we show that upon suppressing these artefacts in carefully controlled experiments, useful information remains. We first investigate the well-explored ferromagnet CoFeB, where the even part of $\rho_{yx}$ contains a contribution from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, which we confirm by Stoner--Wohlfarth modelling. We then apply our approach to magnetotransport measurements of $\rm Mn_5Si_3$ thin films, which undergo a transition from non-collinear to an altermagnetic collinear state. In this material, the even part of the transverse signal is sizable only in the low-spin-symmetry phase below $\approx 80$~K. Transverse resistivity measurements thus offer a simple and readily available probe of magnetic order transitions.</p>

            <p>Eigenstate multifractality, a hallmark of non-interacting disordered metals which can potentially be observed in many-body localized states as well, is characterized by anomalous slow dynamics and appears relevant for many areas of quantum physics from measurement-driven systems to superconductivity. We propose a novel approach to achieve non-ergodic multifractal (NEM) states without disorder by iteratively introducing defects into a crystal lattice, reshaping it from a plain structure into fractal geometry. By comprehensive analysis of the Sierpiński gasket case, we find a robust evidence of the emergence of NEM states that go beyond the conventional classification of quantum states and designate new pathways for quantum transport studies. We discuss potential experimental signatures of these states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yung-Yeh Chang, Kazuma Saito, Chen-Hsuan Hsu</p>
            <p>Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits prominent correlated phenomena in two distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a two-dimensional spin helix phase emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity, reflected in the scaling exponents of various correlation functions, accessible through electrical means. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids. Integrating critical aspects of Luttinger liquid physics, magnetism, and Kondo physics in twisted bilayer graphene, our findings offer insights into similar correlated phenomena across a broad range of twisted van der Waals structures.</p>

            <p>This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Magnetron sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin films are widely used as protective coatings due to their high hardness, but suffer from inherent brittleness and low fracture toughness, limiting their applicability. The multilayering of TiN films with metallic titanium (Ti) interlayers in the form of bi-layer and tri-layer systems have been studied using microcantilever fracture tests. Plastic dissipation in the Ti layer is shown to lead to an increase in crack growth resistance. The effect of the elastic-plastic mismatch between the two materials on the crack driving force, as well as the size of the fully developed plastic zone in Ti have been quantified in this work for the first time. It is shown that incorporating a Ti layer thickness of 250 nm can improve the fracture resistance by nearly ten times compared to the initiation fracture toughness in TiN, preventing catastrophic fracture of these multi-layered films. These results will aid in physics informed design of optimised thickness of metallic interlayers in multi-layered thin films.</p>

            <p>In the strong-coupling regime, the interaction between light and matter reaches a hybridization state where the photonic and material components are inseparably linked. Using tailored states of light to break symmetries in such systems can facilitate the development of novel non-equilibrium quantum materials. Chiral optical cavities offer a promising approach for this, enabling either temporal or spatial symmetry-breaking, both of which are unachievable with conventional mirror cavities. For spatial symmetry-breaking, a cavity must discriminate the handedness of circularly polarized light, a functionality uniquely provided by chiral metamaterials. Here, we propose and demonstrate experimentally a chiral transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) metasurface with broken out-of-plane symmetry, allowing for the selective formation of self-hybridized exciton-polaritons with specific handedness. Our metasurface maintains maximal chirality for oblique incidence up to 20°, significantly outperforming all previously known designs, thereby transforming the angle of incidence from a constraint into a new degree of freedom for sub-nanometer-precise tuning of the cavity's resonant wavelength. Moreover, we study the chiral strong-coupling regime in nonlinear experiments and reveal the polariton-driven nature of chiral third-harmonic generation. Our results demonstrate a clear pathway towards van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces as a novel and potent platform for chiral polaritonics with implications in a wide range of photonics research, such as non-reciprocal photonic devices and valleytronics.</p>

The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yannis Ulrich, Johannes Mitscherling, Laura Classen, Andreas P. Schnyder</p>
            <p>We analyze the quantum geometric contribution to the intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) for a general multiband Hamiltonian. The nonlinear conductivity, obtained in Green's function formalism, is decomposed into its quantum geometric constituents using a projector-based approach. In addition to the previously identified Berry curvature and interband quantum metric dipoles, we obtain a third term of quantum geometric origin, given by the momentum derivative of the $intraband$ quantum metric. This contribution, which we term the intraband quantum metric dipole, provides substantial corrections to the NLHE in topological magnets and becomes the dominant geometric term in topological antiferromagnets with gapped Dirac cones. Considering generalized 2D and 3D Weyl/Dirac Hamiltonians, describing a large class of topological band crossings with sizable quantum geometry, we derive analytical expressions of the NLHE, thereby revealing the individual contributions of the three quantum geometric terms. Combined with an exhaustive symmetry classification of all magnetic space groups, this analysis leads to the identification of several candidate materials expected to exhibit large intrinsic NLHE, including the antiferromagnets $\text{Yb}_3\text{Pt}_4$, $\text{CuMnAs}$, and $\text{CoNb}_3\text{S}_6$, as well as the nodal-plane material $\text{MnNb}_3\text{S}_6$. Finally, our projector-based approach yields a compact expression for the NLHE in terms of momentum derivatives of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix alone, enabling efficient numerical evaluation of each contribution in the aforementioned materials.</p>

            <p>We introduce two classes of junctions in a toric code, a prototypical model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid, and study the nature of anyonic transport across them mediated by Zeeman fields. In the first class of junctions, termed potential barrier junctions, the charges sense effective static potentials and a change in the band mass. In a particular realization, while the junction is completely transparent to the electric charge, magnetic charge transmission is allowed only after a critical field strength. In the second class of junctions we stitch two toric codes with operators which do not commute at the junction. We show that the anyonic transmission gets tuned by effective pseudospin fluctuations at the junction. Using exact analytical mappings and numerical simulations, we compute charge-specific transmission probabilities. Our work, apart from uncovering the rich physical mechanisms at play in such junctions, can motivate experimental work to engineer defect structures in topologically ordered systems for tunable transport of anyonic particles.</p>

            <p>Symmetry plays a central role in defining magnetic phases, making tunable symmetry breaking across magnetic transitions highly desirable for discovering non-trivial magnetism. Magnetic moiré superlattices, formed by twisting two-dimensional (2D) magnetic crystals, have been theoretically proposed and experimentally explored as platforms for unconventional magnetic states. However, despite recent advances, tuning symmetry breaking in moiré magnetism remains limited, as twisted 2D magnets, such as rhombohedral (R)-stacked twisted CrI_3, largely inherit the magnetic properties and symmetries of their constituent layers. Here, in hexagonal-stacked twisted double bilayer (H-tDB) CrI_3, we demonstrate clear symmetry evolution as the twist angle increases from 180^{\circ} to 190^{\circ}. While the net magnetization remains zero across this twist angle range, the magnetic phase breaks only the three-fold rotational symmetry at 180^{\circ}, but it breaks all of the rotational, mirror, and time-reversal symmetries at intermediate twist angles between 181^{\circ} and 185^{\circ}, and all broken symmetries are recovered at 190^{\circ}. These pronounced symmetry breakings at intermediate twist angles are accompanied by metamagnetic behaviors, evidenced by symmetric double hysteresis loops around zero magnetic field. Together, these results reveal that H-tDB CrI_3 at intermediate twist angles host a distinct moiré magnetic phase, featuring periodic in-plane spin textures with broken rotational, mirror, and time-reversal symmetries, which is markedly different from the out-of-plane layered antiferromagnetism in bilayer CrI_3 and the predominantly out-of-plane moiré magnetism in R-tDB CrI_3. Our work establishes H-stacked CrI_3 moiré magnets as a versatile platform for engineering magnetic properties, including and likely beyond complex spin textures.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical framework for probing moiré phonon modes using Raman spectroscopy, and illustrate it with the example of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). These moiré phonons arise from interlayer sliding motion in twisted 2D materials and correspond to fluctuations of the stacking order in reconstructed moiré superlattices. These include both acoustic-like phason modes and a new set of low-energy optical modes originating from the zone-folding of monolayer graphene's acoustic modes, which are accessible via Raman spectroscopy. We show that the Raman response of TBG exhibits a series of low-frequency peaks that clearly distinguish it from that of decoupled layers. We further examine the role of anharmonic interactions in shaping the phonon linewidths and demonstrate the strong dependence of the Raman spectra on both the twist angle and the polarization of the incident light. Our findings establish Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool for exploring moiré phonons in a broad class of twisted van der Waals systems.</p>

            <p>Majorana modes offer great potential for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their topological protection. However, for superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrids, intrinsic disorder makes the unambiguous detection of Majorana modes difficult. Here, we construct 1D spin chains from individual Fe atoms on the Rashba surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111) with proximity-induced superconductivity from a Nb(110) substrate. While the Fe chains exhibit perfect crystalline order, we observe nano-scale potential disorder of the BiAg2/Ag(111)/Nb(110) heterostructure by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, this does not prevent the emergence of zero-energy modes at both ends of the Fe chains, in agreement with tight-binding calculations showing that they are only found in the topologically non-trivial regime of the phase diagram. These Majorana modes are indeed robust against potential disorder.</p>

            <p>The silicon vacancy ($V_{Si}$) in 4H-SiC at its cubic site (V2-center) has shown significant promise for quantum technologies, due to coherent spin states, the mature material system, and stable optical emission. In these SiC-based applications, doping plays a crucial role. It can be used to control the charge state of $V_{Si}$ and formation of different types of defects. Despite its importance, there has been little research on the effects of doping. In this work, we perform a study of the effects of nitrogen doping and annealing on the photoluminescence (PL), optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast, and dephasing times of ensembles of V2 in epilayers of 4H-SiC. The results show an enhancement of PL that depends on the electron irradiation dose for a given electron concentration, supported by theoretical modeling of the charge state of $V_{Si}$ in the presence of nitrogen. Nitrogen substituted for carbon is shown to very efficiently donate one electron to $V_{Si}$. We also observe that the ODMR contrast can be increased from 0.5% in low doped SiC to 1.5% by nitrogen doping of $10^{17}$ to $10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ and annealing at 500-600 $^{\circ}$C for 1 hour, with only a 20% decrease in PL compared to unannealed. Some of the improvement in contrast is offset by a reduction in $T_2^*$ at these doping levels, but the estimated cw ODMR shot-noise limited sensitivity is still 1.6 times higher than that of undoped, unannealed SiC.</p>

            <p>Crystal engineering is a method for discovering new quantum materials and phases, which may be achieved by external pressure or strain. Chemical pressure is unique in that it generates internal pressure perpetually to the lattice. As an example, GdAlSi from the rare-earth ($R$) $R$Al$X$ ($X =$ Si or Ge) family of Weyl semimetals is considered. Replacing Si with the larger isovalent element Ge creates sufficiently large chemical pressure to induce a structural transition from the tetragonal structure of GdAlSi, compatible with a Weyl semimetallic state, to an orthorhombic phase in GdAlGe, resulting in an inversion-symmetry-protected nodal-line metal. We find that GdAlGe hosts an antiferromagnetic ground state with two successive orderings, at $T_\mathrm{N1}$ = 35 K and $T_\mathrm{N2}$ = 30 K. In-plane isothermal magnetization shows a magnetic field induced metamagnetic transition at 6.2 T for 2 K. Furthermore, electron-hole compensation gives rise to a large magnetoresistance of $\sim 100\%$ at 2 K and 14 T. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal a Dirac-like linear band dispersion over an exceptionally large energy range of $\sim$ 1.5 eV with a high Fermi velocity of $\sim 10^6$ m/s, a rare feature not observed in any magnetic topological materials.</p>

            <p>Intrinsic responses are of paramount importance in physics research, as they represent the inherent properties of materials, independent of extrinsic factors that vary from sample to sample, and often reveal the intriguing quantum geometry of the band structure. Here, we report the experimental discovery of a new intrinsic response in charge transport, specifically the intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect (NPHE), in the topological semimetal TaIrTe4. This effect is characterized by an induced Hall current that is quadratic in the driving electric field and linear in the in-plane magnetic field. The response coefficient is determined by the susceptibility tensor of Berry-connection polarizability dipole, which is an intrinsic band geometric quantity. Remarkably, the signal persists up to room temperature. Our theoretical calculations show excellent agreement with the experimental results and further elucidate the significance of a previously unknown orbital mechanism in intrinsic NPHE. This finding not only establishes a novel intrinsic material property but also opens a new route toward innovative nonlinear devices capable of operating at room temperature.</p>

Ab-initio, calculations are performed in the Atomistix Toolkit program within the Density Functional Theory and Local Spin Density Approximation on Tight Tiger basis. We have used Hubbard U potential $U_{Fe} = 2.42$eV for 3d states for Fe ions. Super-cells of 8 and 64 atoms were constructed. After the construction of Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se ($x=$ 6.25%; 25%) super-cells, atom relaxation and optimization of the crystal structure were carried out. Electronic band structure,and density of states were calculated, and total energy have been defined in antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. The band gap for the Cd$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Se, $x=0.06$ in ferromagnetic phase is equal to $E_g=1.77$ eV, in antiferromagnetic phase $E_g=1.78$ eV. For $x=0.25$, $E_g=1.92$ eV. Antiferromagnetic phase considered more stable. Our calculations show that the band gap increases with the increases in Fe ion concentration.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomasz Kwapiński, Marek Dachniewicz, Marcin Kurzyna, Mieczysław Jałochowski</p>
            <p>We analyze both the stationary and time-dependent properties of molecular states in atomic chains on a surface, some of which are composed of atomic states decoupled from the substrate - a phenomenon analogous to dark states in quantum dot systems. To illustrate this effect at the atomic scale, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments on short silicon chains fabricated on a Si(553)-Au surface. In contrast to quantum dots, which typically involve characteristic energies in the meV range or lower, the atomic chains studied here operate in a high-energy regime, with energies in the eV range. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the local density of states of the chains carries clear signatures of these decoupled states, which significantly affect STM imaging. The topography becomes highly sensitive to the bias polarity, to the extent that some atomic sites may appear nearly invisible to the STM tip. Our time-resolved theoretical analysis reveals that these decoupled states emerge over a finite time interval. This oscillatory dynamical evolution, primarily driven by nearest-neighbor interactions, suggests a universal relaxation mechanism that is largely insensitive to the length of the atomic chain.</p>

            <h2>Influence of nanostructuring through high-pressure torsion (HPT) on superconductivity of a high-entropy alloy</h2>

            <p>High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as favorable choices for different applications, including superconductors. The present work examines the impact of nanostructuring via high-pressure torsion (HPT) on the superconducting properties of the equiatomic TiZrHfNbTa HEA. Structural characterization reveals a progressive refinement of grain size and increased dislocation density, together with partial phase transformation to an {\omega} phase with HPT processing. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements indicate a systematic enhancement in the superconducting transition temperature (from $T_c =$ 6.2 K to 7.2 K) and critical magnetic field, as well as the stabilization of the superconductivity state by HPT processing. The improvement of superconducting properties is attributed to microstructural modifications such as grain boundary density, defect generation and phase transformations, and their impact on vortex pinning, quantum confinement and electron scattering. The results suggest that nanostructuring through severe plastic deformation provides an appropriate route to optimize superconducting properties in high-entropy superconductors.</p>

            <p>We develop an exact computational method based on numerical X-propagators for solving polaron models with arbitrary nonlinear couplings of local vibration modes to the electron density and magnitude of the hopping amplitude. Our approach covers various polaron models, some of which were impossible to treat by any existing approximation-free techniques. Moreover, it remains efficient in the most relevant but computationally challenging regime of phonon frequencies much smaller than the electron bandwidth. As a case study, we consider the double-well type nonlinear model with quadratic ($g_2<0$) and quartic ($g_4>0$) interactions describing a broad class of technologically important materials, such as quantum paraelectric compounds and halide perovskites. We observe, depending on the model parameters, three qualitatively different regimes: (i) quantum interplay of quartic and quadratic interactions which suppresses effects of the quadratic coupling, (ii) intermediate-coupling regime with exponential $\propto \exp(\alpha g_2 \Omega^{-1/4})$ scaling of the quasiparticle weight and mass renormalization, and (iii) strong-coupling asymptotic behavior.</p>

            <p>Engineering spin polarization in dissipative bosonic systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, especially for applications in quantum metrology and space-based quantum simulations. This work demonstrates precise magnetic moment control in multicomponent Bose gases during evaporative cooling via tailored magnetic fields. By adjusting the magnetic field gradients, null point position, and duration, we selectively tune evaporation rates of magnetic sublevels, achieving targeted spin polarization. Theoretical models, validated by numerical simulations and Stern-Gerlach experiments, reveal how magnetic fields reshape trapping potentials and spin-dependent dissipation. The results establish a dissipative spin-selection mechanism governing polarization evolution in evaporatively cooled Bose gases and provide a framework for engineering spin-polarized quantum states.</p>

            <h2>Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongxin Zeng, Andrew J. Millis</p>
            <p>Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moiré materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Darshit Solanki, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, A. K. Sood, Anindya Das</p>
            <p>The role of twist angle ($\theta_t$) in tailoring the physical properties of heterostructures is emerging as a new paradigm in two-dimensional materials. The influence of flat electronic bands near the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^{\circ}$) on the phononic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (t-BLG) is not well understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the G and 2D Raman modes of t-BLG samples with twist angles ranging from $\sim$0.3$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$3$^{\circ}$ using micro-Raman spectroscopy. A key finding of our work is the splitting of the G mode near the magic angle due to moiré potential induced phonon hybridization. The linewidth of the low-frequency component of the G mode (G$^-$), as well as the main component of the 2D mode, exhibits enhanced broadening near the magic angle due to increased electron-phonon coupling, driven by the emergence of flat electronic bands. Additionally, temperature-dependent Raman measurements (6-300 K) of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene sample ($\theta_t \sim$ 1$^{\circ}$) reveal an almost tenfold increase in phonon anharmonicity-induced temperature variation in both components of the split G mode, as compared to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene sample, further emphasizing the role of phonon hybridization in this system. These studies could be important for understanding the thermal properties of the twisted bilayer graphene systems.</p>

            <p>An increasing number of Yb-based compounds fulfill the conditions for the investigation of hyperfine electro-nuclear coupling effects related to 171-Yb and 173-Yb isotopes. Among them, the lack of magnetic order down to the milikelvin range in compounds with robust localized electronic moments and their nuclear magnetism. Although reminiscences of short range magnetic interactions may be observed below 1K, such perturbation can be dodged investigating compounds located close to a quantum critical point (QCP), where quantum fluctuations prevent the development of magnetic correlations to develop. Within the family of cubic YbCu4M compounds (M = Ni, Au and Zn), we have investigated YbCu4Zn that shows a logarithmic temperature dependence: C_P /T ~ ln(T/TQ) in its electronic specific heat, as predicted for a QCP. Simultaneously, no signs of RKKY interactions are detected down to 0.03K. Due to the low Kondo temperature of its doublet ground state, the localized 4f electrons weakly couple with conduction electrons, allowing the coupling between nuclear and 4f electron moments to become relevant. However, the reminder Kondo interaction acts on the electronic hyperfine field producing a small deviation from the standard nuclear C_N ~ 1/T^2 dependence into a n < 2 power law. The expected n = 2 dependence is progressively recovered under applied magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Corner Topology Makes Woven Baskets into Stiff, yet Resilient Metamaterials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guowei Wayne Tu, Evgueni T. Filipov</p>
            <p>Basket weaving is a traditional craft used to create practical three-dimensional (3D) structures. While the geometry and aesthetics of baskets have received considerable attention, the underlying mechanics and modern engineering potential remain underexplored. This work shows that 3D woven structures offer similar stiffness yet substantially higher resilience than their non-woven continuous counterparts. We explore corner topologies that serve as building blocks to convert 2D woven sheets into 3D metamaterials that can carry compressive loads. Under small deformations, the woven corners exhibit axial stiffness similar to continuous structures because the woven ribbons are engaged with in-plane loads. Under large deformations, the woven corners can be compressed repeatedly without plastic damage because ribbons can undergo elastic local buckling. We present a modular platform to assemble woven corners into complex spatial metamaterials and demonstrate applications including damage-resilient robotic systems and metasurfaces with tailorable deformation modes. Our results explain the historic appeal of basket weaving, where readily available ribbons are crafted into 3D structures with comparable stiffness yet far superior resilience to continuous systems. The modular assembly of woven metamaterials can further revolutionize design of next-generation automotive components, consumer devices, soft robots, and more where both resilience and stiffness are essential.</p>

            <p>We report the emergence of altermagnetism, a magnetic phase characterized by the coexistence of compensated spin ordering and momentum-dependent spin splitting, in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), a prototypical material system long investigated for its tunable electronic and structural properties. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that vanadium-intercalated stage-1 graphite compounds, exhibit inherent altermagnetic properties. The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic ordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating spin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization. The calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along the high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV with alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits minimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the dominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo simulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K, indicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The combination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and elevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic applications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and topologically robust spin transport. As the first demonstration of carbon-based alternating magnetic systems, this work offers a design paradigm for engineering spin-polarized quantum states governed by crystalline symmetry constraints.</p>

            <p>Bose-Einstein condensation of spin-polarized triplet excitons can give rise to an intriguing spin supercurrent, enabling experimental detection of exciton condensation. In this work, we predict that Ta3X8 (X=I, Br) ferromagnetic monolayers are spin-polarized triplet excitonic insulators (EIs), based on the systematic first-principles GW calculations coupled with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW+BSE). The single-particle calculations of spin-polarized band structures reveal that these monolayers are bipolar magnetic semiconductors, where the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band possess opposite spin polarization. The two low-energy bands, primarily originating from Ta $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, are almost flat. The same-orbital parity and opposite-spin natures of the band-edge states effectively suppress dielectric screening, promoting the emergence of the EI state. The GW+BSE calculations reveal that the binding energy of the lowest-energy exciton is 1.499 eV for Ta3I8 monolayer and 1.986 eV for Ta3Br8 monolayer. Since both values exceed the respective GW band gaps, these results indicate a strong excitonic instability in these monolayers. A wavefunction analysis confirms that the lowest-energy exciton is a tightly bound Frenkel-like state, exhibiting a spin-polarized triplet nature with $S_z=1$. Our findings establish a valuable material platform for investigating spin-polarized triplet EIs, offering promising potential for spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.</p>

Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes.

            <p>The dynamical structure factor of the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) shows universal power-law divergence at its quantum critical point, signatures of which have been arguably observed in inelastic neutron scattering studies of quantum spin chain materials, for example CoNb2O6. However, it has been recently suggested that its microscopic description is better captured in terms of a twisted Kitaev spin chain (TKSC) with bond-anisotropic couplings. Here, we present exact results for the dynamical structure factor of the TKSC across its quantum critical point, analyzing both the universal low-frequency response and the non-universal high-energy features. In addition, we explore extensions of the model including broken glide symmetry as well as the case of random, and incommensurate magnetic fields. Notably, in the latter case the fermionic excitations exhibit a localization-delocalization transition, which is manifest in the dynamical response as a distinct signature at finite frequency. We discuss the relevance of these features for the observation of quantum critical response in experiments.</p>

            <p>In granular hopper flow, is the clogging probability influenced by gravity? Clogging, the spontaneous arrest of granular flow through a constriction, is a fundamental and widespread phenomenon in granular processing. Accurately predicting clogging risk is essential for space-related activities. Yet, conflicting results leave us without a reliable way to extrapolate terrestrial data to low gravity. We introduce an in-bulk definition of the dimensionless granular Bond number, B, to scale clogging probability from Earth gravity to low gravity. By testing multiple lunar regolith simulants in Earth and Moon gravitational accelerations, using an active drop tower, we reveal that low gravity significantly increases clogging risk, challenging previous findings. We observe a gravity-induced shift in the critical orifice below which clogging occurs by up to one order of magnitude. Scaling data with the Bond number unifies scattered results into a state diagram predicting clogging across materials and gravitational accelerations. Our findings provide a practical tool for anticipating granular clogging in reduced gravity, informing future space missions.</p>

This study proposes a transfer learning approach to overcome this limitation by adapting ML models trained on a higher data volume of one source material (Si) to a lower data volume of another target material (Ge and GaAs). The materials were deliberately selected to assess the robustness of the transfer learning approach in handling varying data similarity, with Cz-Ge being similar to Cz-Si, and GaAs grown via the liquid encapsulated Czochralski method (LEC), which differs from Cz-Si. We explore various transfer learning strategies, including Warm Start, Merged Training, and Hyperparameters Transfer, and evaluate multiple ML architectures across two different materials. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances predictive accuracy with minimal data, providing a practical framework for optimizing Cz growth parameters across diverse materials.</p>

            <h2>Role of bubble positioning in force induced melting of DNA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bidisha Mukherjee, Amit Raj Singh, Garima Mishra</p>
            <p>We investigate the role of bubble positioning in the force-induced melting of double-stranded DNA using two distinct approaches: Brownian Dynamics simulations and the Gaussian Network Model. We isolate the effect of bubble positioning by using DNA molecules with 50% AT - 50% GC base-pair composition which ensures constant enthalpy. Our results reveal that it is not just the sequence itself, but its specific arrangement that influences DNA stability. We examine two types of DNA sequences containing a block of either AT or GC base-pairs, resulting in the formation of a large bubble or a smaller bubble within the DNA, respectively. By systematically shifting these blocks along the strand, we investigate how their positioning influences the force-temperature phase diagram of DNA. Our Brownian dynamics simulations reveal that, at high forces, melting of the entire DNA strand is initiated after stretching $\approx 9$ GC base-pairs, independent of the specific base-pair sequence. In contrast, no such characteristic length scale is observed in the Gaussian network model. Our study suggests that free strand entropy plays a significant role in determining the force-temperature phase diagram of the DNA.</p>

            <h2>Hierarchical friction memory leads to subdiffusive configurational dynamics of fast-folding proteins</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton Klimek, Benjamin A. Dalton, Lucas Tepper, Roland R. Netz</p>
            <p>Proteins often exhibit subdiffusive configurational dynamics. The origins of this subdiffusion are still unresolved. We investigate the impact of non-Markovian friction and the free energy landscape on the dynamics of fast-folding proteins in terms of the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the mean first-passage-time (MFPT) of the folding reaction coordinate. We find the friction memory kernel from published molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to be well-described by a hierarchical multi-exponential function, which gives rise to subdiffusion in the MSD over a finite range of time. We show that friction memory effects in fast-folding proteins dominate the scaling behavior of the MSD compared to effects due to the folding free energy landscape. As a consequence, Markovian models are insufficient for capturing the folding dynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including coordinate-dependent friction. Our results demonstrate the importance of memory effects in protein folding and conformational dynamics and explicitly show that subdiffusion in fast-folding protein dynamics originates from memory effects, not from the free energy landscape and not from coordinate-dependent friction.</p>

            <p>Contamination of water by heavy metal ions represents a significant environmental concern. Among various remediation methods, chelation has proven to be an effective technique in water treatment processes. This study investigates the chelating properties of linear polyethyleneimine (PEI) and its complexation with divalent mercury ions (Hg2+) in aqueous solution. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using the OPLS/AA force field to examine the microscopic structure of PEI-Hg2+ complexes. PEI chains of varying lengths were considered, and it was found that a single linear PEI molecule containing ten amino groups is capable of coordinating up to four Hg2+ ions. The stability of the resulting complexes was further supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</p>

            <p>The coarse-grained interactions between Néel skyrmions, stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling (iDMI), are studied through the properties of their hexagonal lattices by micromagnetic simulations. The interactions with the film edges are excluded by imposing periodic boundary conditions. The dependence of skyrmion size and interaction energy on the distance is derived. Two types of behavior are observed depending on the value of iDMI compared to the critical value Dc above which the skyrmion size diverges: For iDMI < Dc the skyrmions acquire a finite size that saturates at maximum value independent of the skyrmion distance that corresponds to the one of the isolated skyrmion. This energy is above that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state. For iDMI > Dc the skyrmions tend to increase in size to the extent that their neighboring skyrmions permit and finite size skyrmions can be stabilized only in arrays due to their mutual repulsion. These configurations have energy below that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state.</p>

            <h2>Generalized energy band alignment model for van der Waals heterostructures with a charge spillage dipole</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungjun Lee, Eng Hock Lee, Young-Kyun Kwon, Steven J. Koester, Phaedon Avouris, Vladimir Cherkassky, Jerry Tersoff, Tony Low</p>
            <p>The energy band alignment at the interface of van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a key design parameter for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Although the Anderson and midgap models have been widely adopted for bulk semiconductor heterostructures, they exhibit severe limitations when applied to vdWHs, particularly for type-III systems. Based on first-principles calculations for approximately $10^3$ vdWHs, we demonstrate these traditional models miss a critical dipole arising from interlayer charge spillage. We introduce a generalized linear response (gLR) model that includes this dipole through a quantum capacitance term while remaining analytically compact. With only two readily computed inputs, the charge neutrality level offset and the sum of the isolated-layer bandgaps, the gLR reproduces DFT band line-ups with $r^2\sim$0.9 across type-I, II, and III stacks. Machine-learning feature analysis confirms that these two descriptors dominate the underlying physics, indicating the model is near-minimal and broadly transferable. The gLR framework therefore provides both mechanistic insight and a fast, accurate surrogate for high-throughput screening of the vast vdW heterostructure design space.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yinqi Chen, Cheng Xu, Yang Zhang, Constantin Schrade</p>
            <p>A recent experiment has reported unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, emerging from a normal state that exhibits a finite anomalous Hall effect -- a signature of intrinsic chirality. Motivated by this discovery, we construct a continuum model for twisted MoTe$_2$ constrained by lattice symmetries from first-principles calculations that captures the moiré-induced inversion symmetry breaking even in the absence of a displacement field. Building on this model, we show that repulsive interactions give rise to finite-momentum superconductivity via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism in this chiral moiré system. Remarkably, the finite-momentum superconducting state can arise solely from internal symmetry breaking of the moiré superlattice, differentiating it from previously studied cases that require external fields. It further features a nonreciprocal quasiparticle dispersion and an intrinsic superconducting diode effect. Our results highlight a novel route to unconventional superconducting states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides moiré systems, driven entirely by intrinsic symmetry-breaking effects.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed at complex oxide interfaces offer a unique platform to engineer quantum nanostructures. However, scalable fabrication of locally addressable devices in these materials remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an efficient fabrication approach by patterning narrow constrictions in a superconducting KTaO3-based heterostructure. The constrictions are individually tunable via the coplanar side gates formed within the same 2DEG plane. Our technique leverages the high dielectric permittivity of KTaO3 (epsilon_r ~ 5000) to achieve strong electrostatic modulation of the superconducting 2DEG. Transport measurements through the constriction reveal a range of transport regimes: Within the superconducting state, we demonstrate efficient modulation of the critical current and Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transition temperature at the weak link. Further tuning of the gate voltage reveals an unexpectedly regular Coulomb blockade pattern. All of these states are achievable with a side gate voltage |V_SG| < 1 V. The fabrication process is scalable and versatile, enabling a platform both to make superconducting field-effect transistors and to study a wide array of physical phenomena present at complex oxide interfaces.</p>

            <p>Starting from a generalization of Weyl's relations in finite dimension $N$, we show that the Heisenberg commutation relations can be satisfied in a specific $N-1$ dimensional subspace, and display a linear map for projecting operators to this subspace.

This family of commuting matrices is then related to Type-1 matrices representing quantum integrable models. The commuting matrices find an interesting application in quantum computation, specifically in Grover's database search problem. Each member of the hierarchy serves as a candidate Hamiltonian for quantum adiabatic evolution and, in some cases, achieves higher fidelity than standard choices -- thus offering improved performance.</p>

            <p>Accurate \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces are essential to understand and predict collisional outcomes in ultracold molecular systems. In this study, we explore the intermolecular interactions between two laser-cooled CaF molecules, both in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the observed collisional losses on the non-reactive, spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute twelve electronic states of the Ca$_2$F$_2$ complex within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Calculating the potential energy surfaces for the excited electronic states of Ca$_2$F$_2$ is challenging and computationally expensive. Our approach employs the multireference configuration interaction method, restricted to single and double excitations, along with a reasonably large active space to ensure the convergence in the excited states. We also compute the spin-orbit coupling between the ground state and the lowest spin-polarized triplet state, as well as the spin-spin coupling within the lowest triplet state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$. Additionally, we determine the electric transition dipole moments for the (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(2) $^3\mathrm{A}'$ and (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$-(1) $^3\mathrm{A}''$ transitions. Notably, we find that the lowest spin-polarized state (1) $^3\mathrm{A}'$, shifted by 1064 nm of laser light from the optical dipole trap, intersects several electronically excited states. Finally, by analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss two plausible pathways that may account for the observed collisional losses on the spin-polarized surface of the CaF+CaF system.</p>

            <h2>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenric P. Nelson</p>
            <p>Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes, a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to $p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE); however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where $d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables $(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems, $q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.</p>

            <p>Salt precipitation during CO$_2$ storage in saline aquifers presents challenges for injectivity and containment, with broader implications for soil salinization and cultural heritage preservation. This study utilizes time-lapse X-ray and spectral micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, and deep learning-assisted image analysis to investigate halite crystallization and brine consumption in porous medium. We identified three-dimensional halite growth structures functioning as a secondary porous medium. Visualizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of salt-brine coexistence and halite precipitation revealed critical insights into the self-enhancing nature of salt growth. Expanding gas-liquid contact surfaces and initial crystal nucleation sites significantly enhanced evaporation and growth rates. Hydrophilic halite crystals attract brine films, establishing a feedback loop that perpetuates growth. The encapsulation of brine between grain surfaces and umbrella-like salt crusts was observed. Delineating the self-enhancing growth, including the role of capillary forces and surface-interface processes, is crucial for improving CO$_2$ injection efficiency and integrity, as well as for addressing environmental challenges related to soil salinization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Reese E. Jones, Adrian Buganza Tepole, Jan N. Fuhg</p>
            <p>Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes. This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for gradient-based learning and inference. A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression, enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability, making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and physical simulation.</p>

            <p>Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth. However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1 million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional (application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.</p>

We consider static-electric-field shielded polar alkali-metal diatomic molecules and corresponding FL tetramers in their $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$ ground electronic state. We show that the excited metastable $\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+ + \textrm{b}^3\Pi$ electronic manifold supports FL tetramers in a broader range of electric fields with collisional shielding extended to zero field. We calculate the Franck-Condon factors between the ground and excited FL tetramers and show that they are highly tunable with the electric field. We also predict photoassociation (PA) of ground-state shielded molecules to the excited FL states in free-bound optical transitions. We propose proof-of-principle experiments to implement STIRAP and PA using FL tetramers, paving the way for the formation of deeply bound ultracold polyatomic molecules.</p>

            <p>Commercial fusion power plants demand magnet materials that retain structural integrity and thermal conductivity while operating under the bombardment of energetic neutrons at cryogenic temperatures. Understanding how thermo-mechanical properties evolve under such extreme loads is crucial for selecting materials with high radiation tolerance and predictable failure mechanisms. Presented here is a facility that combines cryogenic transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) with simultaneous ion irradiation, enabling in-situ measurements of thermal diffusivity and surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency spectra. Employing copper as a benchmark material, an irradiation was performed at 30 K with 12.4 MeV $\text{Cu}^{6+}$ ions producing a final fluence of $1.9 \times 10^{17}$ ions/m$^2$. Over the irradiation period, thermal diffusivity nearly halved from an initial value of $1.2 \times 10^{-4}$ $\text{m}^2/\text{s}$ while SAW speed did not show significant change, maintaining a value of $2162\pm18$ m/s. Given its real-time monitoring capability and the numerous candidate materials that remain uncharacterized under fusion magnet operating conditions, this facility is poised to deliver new scientific insights into fusion magnet material degradation trends, contributing to improved design criteria and operational certainty for forthcoming fusion power plants.</p>

            <p>Quantum annealers have emerged as versatile and controllable platforms for experimenting on exotic spin systems that model quantum materials. However, quantum annealing experiments have yet to explore magnetic memory and hysteresis, features seemingly at odds with hardware designed to escape metastable states via quantum tunneling, favoring forgetfulness. Here, we present a general protocol to experiment on magnetic hysteresis in a transverse-field Ising model. We implement it on three D-Wave superconducting flux qubit annealers, using up to thousands of spins, and explore both ferromagnetic and disordered Ising models across contrasting graph topologies. Crucially, we observe robust memory retention in hysteresis loops, establishing quantum annealers as a platform for probing non-equilibrium emergent magnetic phenomena. This approach enables many topics of future exploration including return point memory and hysteresis in frustrated or topologically ordered systems, thus broadening the role of analog quantum computers into foundational questions in condensed matter physics.</p>

Gurney made significant contributions to the application of quantum mechanics to problems related to tunneling of alpha-particles from nuclei, to formation of images in photographic plates, the understanding of the origin of color-centres in salt crystals, and in the theory of semiconductors. He was the first physicist to apply quantum mechanics to the theory of electrochemistry and ionic solutions. He also made fundamental contributions to ballistics research. Gurney wrote a number of textbooks on fundamental and applied quantum mechanics in a distinctive style which are still useful as educational resources. In addition to his scientific contributions, he travelled extensively, and during and after World War II worked in the United States. During the cold war, he got entangled in the Klaus Fuchs affair and lost his employment. He died at the age of 54 in 1953 from a stroke.

            <p>Hydrogen-based materials are able to possess extremely high superconducting critical temperatures, \tc s, due to hydrogen's low atomic mass and strong electron-phonon interaction. Recently, a descriptor based on the Electron Localization Function (ELF) has enabled the rapid estimation of the \tc\ of hydrogen-containing compounds from electronic networking properties, but its applicability has been limited by the small size and homogeneity of the training dataset used. Herein, the model is re-examined compiling a publicly available combined dataset of 244 binary and ternary hydride superconductors. Our analysis shows that though ELF-based networking remains a valuable descriptor, its predictive power declines with increasing compositional complexity. However, by introducing the molecularity index, defined as the highest value of the ELF at which two hydrogen atoms connect, and applying symbolic regression, the accuracy of the predictions can be substantially enhanced. These results establish a more robust framework for assessing superconductivity in hydride materials, facilitating accelerated screening of novel candidates through integration with crystal structure prediction methods or high-throughput searches.</p>

The treatment, performed as a final processing step prior to device packaging, starts by conformally removing the native metal oxide and fabrication residues from the exposed surfaces through ALE before \textit{in situ} encapsulating the metal surfaces with a thin dielectric layer using ALD. We measure a two-fold reduction in loss attributed to two-level system (TLS) absorption in treated aluminum-based resonators and planar transmon qubits. Treated transmons with compact capacitor plates and gaps achieve median $Q$ and $T_1$ values of $3.69 \pm 0.42 \times 10^6$ and $196 \pm 22$~$\mu$s, respectively. These improvements were found to be sustained over several months. We discuss how the combination of ALE and ALD reverses fabrication-induced surface damages to significantly and durably improve device performance via a reduction of the TLS defect density in the capacitive elements.</p>

So far, models of this phenomenon are more macroscopic in nature. However, basic mechanisms at work could be accessible to minimal mathematical models. Here we combine a simple mechanism for economic growth with a mechanism for the spreading of social dissatisfaction. Broad wealth distributions generated by the economic mechanism eventually trigger social unrest and the destruction of wealth, leading to an emerging pattern of boom and bust. We find that the model time scales compare well with empirical data. The model emphasizes the role of broad (power law) wealth distributions for dynamical social phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Imaging of microwave magnetic field orientation using continuous-wave experiments on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akshat Rana, Pooja Lamba, Atanu Ghosh, Siddharth Dhomkar, Rama K. Kamineni</p>
            <p>Imaging of microwave magnetic fields with nano-scale resolution has interesting applications. Specifically, detecting the orientation of the microwave fields is useful in condensed matter physics and quantum control. However, most of the existing methods for microwave field imaging are limited to detecting the magnitude of the fields. Due to their small sensor size and favorable optical and spin properties, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are highly suitable for imaging dc and ac magnetic fields. The reported methods for detecting the orientation of microwave magnetic fields use pulsed Rabi frequency measurements. Here, we demonstrate imaging of the orientation of microwave magnetic fields by only using continuous-wave experiments on NV centers. This simplifies the sensor apparatus and is particularly advantageous in applications where pulsing of the target microwave field is not possible. The method requires static bias magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the quantization axis of NV centers. We detect the direction of an arbitrary microwave magnetic field using NV centers of two different orientations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the projection of the microwave fields onto a plane can be imaged using NV centers of single orientation. It can be straightforwardly implemented using a single NV center.</p>

            <p>Exchanging energy below the superconducting gap introduces quasiparticle energy distributions in superconducting quantum circuits, which will be responsible for their decoherence. This study examines the impact of quasiparticle energy on the performance of NbN superconducting microwave coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon chips.

Moreover, by calculating the complex conductivity of the NbN film, we identified the contribution of quasiparticle density to the experimental results.</p>

            <h2>Basal layer of granular flow down smooth and rough inclines: kinematics, slip laws and rheology</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Teng Wang, Lu Jing, Fiona C.Y. Kwok, Yuri D. Sobral, Thomas Weinhart, Anthony R. Thornton</p>
            <p>Granular flow down an inclined plane is ubiquitous in geophysical and industrial applications. On rough inclines, the flow exhibits Bagnold's velocity profile and follows the so-called $\mu(I)$ local rheology. On insufficiently rough or smooth inclines, however, velocity slip occurs at the bottom and a basal layer with strong agitation emerges below the bulk, which is not predicted by the local rheology. Here, we use discrete element method simulations to study detailed dynamics of the basal layer in granular flows down both smooth and rough inclines. We control the roughness via a dimensionless parameter, $R_a$, varied systematically from 0 (flat, frictional plane) to near 1 (very rough plane). Three flow regimes are identified: a slip regime ($R_a \lesssim 0.45$) where a dilated basal layer appears, a no-slip regime ($R_a \gtrsim 0.6$) and an intermediate transition regime. In the slip regime, the kinematics profiles (velocity, shear rate and granular temperature) of the basal layer strongly deviate from Bagnold's profiles. General basal slip laws are developed which express the slip velocity as a function of the local shear rate (or granular temperature), base roughness and slope angle. Moreover, the basal layer thickness is insensitive to flow conditions but depends somewhat on the inter-particle coefficient of restitution. Finally, we show that the rheological properties of the basal layer do not follow the $\mu(I)$ rheology, but are captured by Bagnold's stress scaling and an extended kinetic theory for granular flows. Our findings can help develop more predictive granular flow models in the future.</p>

            <h2>Analyzing partially-polarized light with a photonic deep random neural network</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Petrini, Claudio Conti, Davide Pierangeli</p>
            <p>Optical neural networks are emerging as a powerful and versatile tool for processing optical signals directly in the optical domain with superior speed, integrability, and functionality. Their application to optical polarization enables neuromorphic polarization sensors, but their operation is limited to fully-polarized light. Here, we demonstrate single-shot analysis of partially-polarized beams with a photonic random neural network (PRNN). The PRNN is composed of a series of optical layers implemented by a stack of scattering media and a few trainable digital nodes. The setup infers the degree-of-polarization and the Stokes parameters of the polarized component with precision comparable to off-the-shelf polarimeters. The use of several optical layers allows to enhance the accuracy, reduce the sensor size, and minimize digital costs, demonstrating the advantage of a deep optical encoder for processing polarization information. Our results point out photonic neural networks as fast, compact, broadband, low-cost polarimeters that are widely applicable from sensing to imaging.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wang, Xu-Yang Hou, Yan He, Hao Guo</p>
            <p>Topological properties of quantum systems at finite temperatures, described by mixed states, pose significant challenges due to the triviality of the Uhlmann bundle. We introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number, to characterize the topological properties of mixed states. By inserting the density matrix into the Chern character, we introduce the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number, a generalization of the Chern number that reduces to the pure-state value in the zero-temperature limit and vanishes at infinite temperature, providing a framework to study the temperature-dependent evolution of topological features in mixed states. We provide, for the first time, a rigorous mathematical proof that the first- and higher-order Uhlmann-Chern numbers converge to the corresponding Chern numbers in the zero-temperature limit, differing only by a factor of $1/D$ for $D$-fold degenerate ground states. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through applications to a two-level system, the coherent state model, the 2D Haldane model, and a four-band model, highlighting the temperature-dependent behavior of topological invariants. Our results establish a robust bridge between the topological properties of pure and mixed states, offering new insights into finite-temperature topological phases.</p>

            <h2>Size distribution of decaying foam bubbles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ildoo Kim</p>
            <p>The most studies on the stability of foam bubbles investigated the mechanical stability of thin films between bubbles due to the drainage by gravity. In the current work, we take an alternative approach by assuming the rupture of bubbles as a series of random events and by investigating the time evolution of the size distribution of foam bubbles over a long time up to several hours. For this purpose, we first prepared layers of bubbles on Petri dishes by shaking soap solutions of a few different concentrations, and then we monitored the Petri dishes by using a time-lapse video imaging technique. We analyzed the captured images by custom software to count the bubble size distribution with respect to the initial concentration and elapsed time. From the statistics on our data, we find that the total bubble volume decreases exponentially in time, and the exponent, i.e. the mean lifetime, is a function of the bubble size. The mean lifetimes of larger bubbles are observed to be shorter than those of smaller bubbles, by approximately a factor of 2.</p>

            <h2>Entanglement growth and information capacity in a quasiperiodic system with a single-particle mobility edge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuqi Qing, Yu-Qin Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang</p>
            <p>We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-André model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> O. Daneshmandi, M. Alidadi, Y.M. Banad, S. S. Sharif</p>
            <p>We present a Solid-State Optical Magnetometer (SOM) based on black phosphorus (BP) multilayers, offering a compact, scalable, and highly sensitive alternative to traditional atomic-based magnetometers. Utilizing BP's intrinsic linear dichroism in a metasurface cavity, the SOM achieves sub-nanotesla precision and vector magnetic field sensing. BP enhances light-matter interactions, enabling tunable optical responses driven by Lorentz force-induced cavity deformation. Optimized metasurface unit cells increase polarization-dependent absorption, improving detection sensitivity. Finite Element Method simulations show high linearity (R-squared > 0.999), tunable dynamic range, and adjustable sensitivity via current modulation. At 200 microamps, the SOM reaches a sensitivity of 31.25 picotesla, while lower currents expand the dynamic range up to +-10 nanotesla. This tunability allows for application-specific optimization in areas such as biomagnetic sensing, metrology, and industrial field detection. Unlike SQUIDs and optically pumped magnetometers, the BP-based SOM operates at room temperature and nanoscale dimensions with comparable sensitivity, eliminating the need for cryogenics or vapor cells. Power consumption remains under 1 microwatt, far below conventional technologies. This work establishes BP metasurface integration as a promising platform for low-power, miniaturized, and high-performance magnetic field sensing.</p>

            <h2>Measurement induced scrambling and emergent symmetries in random circuits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haifeng Tang, Hong-Yi Wang, Zhong Wang, Xiao-Liang Qi</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement is affected by unitary evolution, which spreads the entanglement through the whole system, and also by measurements, which usually tends to disentangle subsystems from the rest. Their competition has been known to result in the measurement-induced phase transition. But more intriguingly, measurement alone has the ability to drive a system into different entanglement phases. In this work, we map the entanglement evolution under unitaries and/or measurements into a classical spin problem. This framework is used to understand a myriad of random circuit models analytically, including measurement-induced and measurement-only transitions. Regarding many-body joint measurements, a lower bound of measurement range that is necessary for a global scrambled phase is derived. Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or SU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit dimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin dynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.</p>

            <p>Multilayer assemblies of metal nanoparticles can act as photonic structures, where collective plasmon resonances hybridize with cavity modes to create plasmon-polariton states. For sufficiently strong coupling, plasmon polaritons qualitatively alter the optical properties of light-matter systems, with applications ranging from sensing to solar energy. However, results from experimental studies have raised questions about the role of nanoparticle structural disorder in plasmon-polariton formation and light-matter coupling in plasmonic assemblies. Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has practical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle superlattices are slow and scale poorly. Modeling realistic disorder requires large system sizes, which is challenging using conventional electromagnetic simulations. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations to construct large-scale nanoparticle multilayers with controlled structural order. We investigate their optical response using a superposition T-matrix method with 2-D periodic boundary conditions. We find that while structural disorder broadens the polaritonic stop band and the near-field hot-spot distribution, the polariton dispersion and coupling strength remain unaltered. To understand effects of nanoparticle composition, we consider assemblies with model particles mimicking gold or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. Losses due to higher damping in ITO nanocrystals prevent their assemblies from achieving the deep strong coupling of gold nanoparticle multilayers, although the former still exhibit ultrastrong coupling. We demonstrate that while computationally efficient mutual polarization method calculations employing the quasistatic approximation modestly overestimate the strength of the collective plasmon, they reproduce the polariton dispersion relations determined by electrodynamic simulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vladislav Efremkin, Julian Heske, Thomas D. Kühne, Emil Prodan</p>
            <p>Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.</p>

            <p>Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.</p>

            <p>One of the roadblocks towards the implementation of a fault-tolerant superconducting quantum processor is impacts of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. Such impacts temporarily elevate the density of quasiparticles (QPs) across the device, leading to correlated qubit error bursts. The most damaging errors, $T_1$ errors, stem from QP tunneling across the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs). Recently, we demonstrated that this type of error can be strongly suppressed by engineering the profile of superconducting gap at the JJs in a way that prevents QP tunneling. In this work, we identify a new type of impact-induced correlated error that persists in the presence of gap engineering. We observe that impacts shift the frequencies of the affected qubits, and thus lead to correlated phase errors. The frequency shifts are systematically negative, reach values up to $3\,{\rm MHz}$, and last for $\sim 1\,{\rm ms}$. We provide evidence that the shifts originate from QP-qubit interactions in the JJ region. Further, we demonstrate that the shift-induced phase errors can be detrimental to the performance of quantum error correction protocols.</p>

            <p>We investigate a critical many-body system by introducing a Rényi generalized mutual information, connecting between Rényi mutual information and Rényi Shannon mutual information. This Rényi generalized mutual information can offer more experimentally accessible alternative than the conventional entanglement entropy. As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in Rényi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the Rényi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional Rényi Shannon mutual information and Rényi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the Rényi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the Rényi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects. We find that Rényi-$2$ type central charge connected to the central charge is fairly robust, indicating the strong robustness of the Ising CFT properties against local decoherence by environment.</p>

As the strength of xenophobic interactions and the rationality of individuals with respect to social stress decrease, this transition changes from continuous to discontinuous, with a strong dependence on the initial conditions. The size of the parameter region where consensus can be reached from any initial condition decays as a power-law function of the number of discussed topics.</p>

This enables quantitatively resolving residual stress states and the role of brittle, hard regions of the weld such as the heat affected zone (HAZ). Failure pressures can be efficiently quantified as a function of asset state (existing defects), materials and weld procedures adopted, and hydrogen purity. Importantly, simulations spanning numerous relevant conditions (defect size and orientations) are used to build \emph{Virtual} Failure Assessment Diagrams (FADs), enabling a straightforward uptake of this mechanistic approach in fitness-for-service assessment. Model predictions are in very good agreement with FAD approaches from the standards but show that the latter are not conservative when resolving the heterogeneous nature of the weld microstructure. Appropriate, \emph{mechanistic} FAD safety factors are established that account for the role of residual stresses and hard, brittle weld regions.</p>

            <p>We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</p>

            <p>The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</p>

            <p>A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</p>

            <p>We present a novel and efficient real space, semiclassical model of electric polarization with general applicability to any system in which screening plays an important role. This model includes the effects of both atomic and bond polarizabilities, the latter originating from the modification of local bond charge transfer energies induced by polarizing charges. The nonlinear interference of multiple polarization clouds and the emergence of local field effects are highlighted as key phenomena highly influencing the short-range screening of the Coulomb interaction. As a representative system to showcase this model, the screened interaction between doped holes in the CuO$_2$ planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors is investigated. This leads to the emergence of striking direction-dependent short-range minima in their Coulomb repulsion, which can strongly reduce the need for retardation effects and allow for an enhancement of the attractive interaction resulting from the exchange of bosons between two electrons or holes. This in turn enhances T$_C$, shortens the Cooper pair coherence length and supports the materialization of the pseudogap phase anisotropy observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</p>

            <p>The synthesis of nm-thick epitaxial films of iron garnets by physical vapor deposition has opened up exciting opportunities for the on-chip generation and processing of microwave signals encoded in magnons. However, iron garnet thin films suffer from demanding lattice-matching and stoichiometry requirements. Here a new approach to their synthesis is developed, enabling a precise and continuous tuning of iron garnet compositions based on the co-sputtering of binary oxides. By substituting a controlled proportion of iron with additional yttrium, Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films of high crystalline quality are obtained, combining a widely tunable lattice parameter and excellent magnetization dynamics. This enables iron garnet thin films suited for cryogenic applications, which have long remained impractical due to microwave losses caused by paramagnetic garnet substrates. Low-temperature ferromagnetic resonance confirms the elimination of substrate paramagnetic losses for Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films lattice-matched to Y$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$ (YSGG), a diamagnetic substrate. The Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ system can be matched to other substrates such as (Gd,Y)$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$. Bi-substituted films of (Bi$_{0.8}$Y$_{2.2}$)Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ also have ideal lattice matching to YSGG, demonstrating the versatility of this approach. This opens unprecedented options for cation substitutions in iron garnet films, offering a promising avenue to new properties and quantum magnonic devices operating in low-temperature environments.</p>

            <h2>Towards a micromechanical qubit based on quantized oscillations in superfluid helium</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Priya Sharma, Jens Koch, Eran Ginossar</p>
            <p>Superconducting circuits can exhibit quantized energy levels and long coherence times. Harnessing the anharmonicity offered by Josephson junctions, such circuits have been successfully employed as qubits, quantum limited amplifiers and sensors. Here, we consider superfluidity as the charge-neutral analogue of superconductivity. Both dissipationless mass flow and Josephson tunneling have been demonstrated in superfluid helium. We propose a quantum device, consisting of a superfluid weak link and a mechanical element. The superfluid motion in this device is quantized. The resulting discrete energy levels are resolvable at millikelvin temperatures essential to maintaining the superfluid state. Appropriate device engineering can yield the necessary nonlinearity to realize qubit functionality. Hence, this device can potentially operate as a charge-neutral, superfluid quantum bit with micron-sized dimensions and millisecond scale coherence time. We show that this quantum regime is within reach for a range of device designs.</p>

            <h2>Flat bands in tight-binding lattices with anisotropic potentials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arindam Mallick, Alexei Andreanov</p>
            <p>We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flat bands in anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians [Mallick et al., Phys.~Rev.~A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-\(\mathcal{PT}\) symmetric Hamiltonians with an \(E=0\) flat band by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flat bands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered \(E=0\) flat bands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flat-band eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flat-band eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</p>

            <h2>Monte Carlo Study of Critical Fermi Surface with Spatially Disordered Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tu Hong, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Non-Fermi liquids are an important topic in condensed matter physics, as their characteristics challenge the framework of traditional Fermi liquid theory and reveal the complex behavior of electrons in strongly interacting systems. Despite some progress in this field, linear-in-temperature resistivity and inverse-in-frequency tail of optical conductivity are unresolved issues in non-Fermi liquids. Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model at finite $N$, beyond the large-$N$ used in previous theoretical work, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC, particularly in capturing the $\omega \ln \omega$ type self-energy characteristic of marginal Fermi liquid behavior, though temperature limitations prevent us from observing the linear-in-temperature scattering rate. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory, and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistivity.</p>

            <p>In Entropy 24, 83 (2022) [1], titled "The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect", A. Nikulov claims that the Meissner effect exhibited by type I superconductors violates the second law of thermodynamics. Contrary to this claim, I show that the Meissner effect is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics provided that a mechanism exists for the supercurrent to start and stop without generation of Joule heat. The theory of hole superconductivity provides such a mechanism, the conventional theory of superconductivity does not. It requires the existence of hole carriers in the normal state of the system.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Competition Between Hubbard and Superexchange Interactions Selectively Localizes Electrons and Holes Through Polarons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jocelyn L. Mendes, Hyun Jun Shin, Jae Yeon Seo, Nara Lee, Young Jai Choi, Joel B. Varley, Scott K. Cushing</p>
            <p>Controlling the effects of photoexcited polarons in transition metal oxides can enable the long timescale charge separation necessary for renewable energy applications as well as controlling new quantum phases through dynamically tunable electron-phonon coupling. In previously studied transition metal oxides, polaron formation is facilitated by a photoexcited ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). When the polaron is formed, oxygen atoms move away from iron centers, which increases carrier localization at the metal center and decreases charge hopping. Studies of yttrium iron garnet and erbium iron oxide have suggested that strong electron and spin correlations can modulate photoexcited polaron formation. To understand the interplay between strong spin and electronic correlations in highly polar materials, we studied gadolinium iron oxide (GdFeO3), which selectively forms photoexcited polarons through an Fe-O-Fe superexchange inter-action. Excitation-wavelength-dependent transient extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectroscopy selectively excites LMCT and metal-to-metal charge transfer transitions (MMCT). The LMCT transition suppresses photoexcited polaron formation due to the balance between superexchange and Hubbard interactions, while MMCT transitions result in photoexcited polaron formation within 250+/-40 fs. Ab initio theory demonstrates that electron and hole polarons localize on iron centers following MMCT. In addition to understanding how strong electronic and spin correlations can control strong electron-phonon coupling, these experiments separately measure electron and hole polaron interactions on neighboring metal centers for the first time, providing insight into a large range of charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard insulators.</p>

            <h2>Anyon polarons as a window into competing phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a Zeeman field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuan Chen, Inti Sodemann Villadiego</p>
            <p>We compute the spectra of anyon quasiparticles in all three super-selection sectors of the Kitaev model (i.e., visons, fermions and bosons), perturbed by a Zeeman field away from its exactly solvable limit, to gain insights on the competition of its non-abelian spin-liquid with other nearby phases, such as the mysterious intermediate state observed in the antiferromagnetic model. Both for the ferro- and antiferro-magnetic models we find that the fermions and visons become gapless at nearly identical critical Zeeman couplings. In the ferromagnetic model this is consistent with a direct transition into a polarized state. In the anti-ferromagnetic model this implies that previous theories of the intermediate phase viewed as a spin liquid with a different fermion Chern number are inadequate, as they presume that the vison gap does not close. In the antiferromagnetic model we also find that a bosonic quasiparticle becomes gapless at nearly the same critical field as the fermions and visons. This boson carries the quantum numbers of an anti-ferromagnetic order parameter, suggesting that the intermediate phase has spontaneously broken symmetry with this order.</p>

            <h2>Superconducting Proximity Effect in Two-Dimensional Hole Gases</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Serafim S. Babkin, Benjamin Joecker, Karsten Flensberg, Maksym Serbyn, Jeroen Danon</p>
            <p>Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of $s$-wave and $d$-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our results thus present a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.</p>

            <h2>Polaronic dressing of bound states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis A. Peña Ardila, Arturo Camacho-Guardian</p>
            <p>Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.</p>

            <h2>Sliding wear: role of plasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruibin Xu, B.N.J. Persson</p>
            <p>We present experimental wear data for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sliding on tile, sandpaper, and polished steel surfaces, as well as for soda-lime, borosilicate, and quartz glass sliding on sandpaper. The results are compared with a recently developed theory \cite{ToBe} of sliding wear based on crack propagation (fatigue), originally formulated for elastic contact and here extended to include plasticity. The elastoplastic wear model predicts wear rates that agree reasonably well with the experimental results for PMMA and soda-lime glass. However, deviations observed for quartz suggest that material-specific deformation mechanisms, particularly the differences between crystalline and amorphous structures, may need to be considered for accurate wear predictions across different materials. In addition, the model reveals a non-monotonic dependence of the wear rate on the penetration hardness $\sigma_{\rm P}$. Thus, for plastically soft material, the wear rate increases with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$, while for hard materials, it decreases. This contrasts with Archard's wear law, where the wear rate decreases monotonically with increasing $\sigma_{\rm P}$.</p>

            <p>We present new atomistic models of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) surfaces. The a-Si model included 4096 atoms and was obtained using local orbital density functional theory. By analyzing a slab model (periodic in two dimensions with a slab about 44 Å thick), we observed a strong correlation between surface structure and surface charge density, which might be compared to STM experiments. Hydrogen atoms added near the under-coordinated surface atoms passivate dangling bonds and induce structural rearrangements. We analyze the electronic structure, including the localization of the states, and note resonant mixing between bulk and surface defect structures. We also compute the classical normal modes of the hydrogenated a-Si and compare them to experiments where possible. Our work is a step toward understanding the meaning of ``surface reconstruction" for a noncrystalline material.</p>

            <p>We present a study of low-concentration Zn (II) impurities in L-Alanine Single Crystal (ZNLA) employing resonant Raman scattering and optical absorption spectroscopy. By analyzing the relative integrated intensity of the selective vibrational modes, we observe a resonant enhancement of Raman-active modes near the UV absorption band, associated with vibrations of the amino and carboxyl groups in ZNLA. These findings suggest that zinc cations occupy an interstitial position coordinated by amino and carboxyl groups. Also, ZNLA single crystal shows a strong antiresonance behavior for some modes associated with amino and carboxyl groups. The antiresonance model in the cross-section allowed the estimation of the bandgap to be 3.8 eV, which perfectly agrees with the direct bandgap obtained from the absorption spectrum (3.75 eV). Finally, our approach proves to be useful for detecting interactions between transition metal ion impurities and intramolecular structures in other transition metal-doped organic amino acid systems.</p>

            <h2>Theory of fractional corner charges in cylindrical crystal shapes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hidetoshi Wada, Tiantian Zhang, Shuichi Murakami</p>
            <p>Recent studies showed that topologically trivial insulators may have fractionally quantized corner charges due to the topological invariant called a filling anomaly. Such crystal shapes in three dimensions are restricted to vertex-transitive polyhedra, which are classified into spherical and cylindrical families. The previous works derived formulas of the fractional corner charge for the spherical family, which corresponds to the tetrahedral and cubic space groups (SGs). In this study, we derive all the corner charge formulas for the cylindrical family, which corresponds to the orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and trigonal crystal shapes. We show that all the real-space formulas of the filling anomaly for the cylindrical SGs are universally determined by the total charges at the Wyckoff position (WP) 1a. Moreover, we derive the k-space formulas of the corner charge for the cylindrical cases with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). From our results, we also show that CsLi$_{2}$Cl_{3}, KN_{3}, and Li_{3}N are candidate materials with a quantized corner charge by using the ab initio calculations. Together with our previous work, we exhaust corner charge formulas for all the SGs and crystal shapes having quantized corner charges.</p>

            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>Recent studies of 2D moiré materials have opened opportunities for advancing condensed matter physics. However, the effect of 1D moiré potentials on topological and correlated phases remains largely unexplored. Here we reveal a sequence of trivial-to-topological transitions and periodic-moiré-spin density waves induced by the 1D commensurate moiré potentials for spin-1/2 fermionic atoms. Such reentrant topology from a trivial phase is absent without the moiré potential and can be understood as the renormalization of topological parameters by the moiré strength. We then unveil the critical exponent and localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates. The periodic spin density wave of many-body ground states is contributed by the moiré potential, and is enhanced by on-site interactions but suppressed by nearest-neighbor interactions. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moiré systems, and the realization of the proposed model is promising in near-future ultracold atom setups.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takato Yoshimura, Lucas Sá</p>
            <p>We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

            <h2>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peerasait Prachaseree, Emma Lejeune</p>
            <p>Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks generated from a Voronoi diagram, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</p>

            <p>This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.</p>

            <p>Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</h2>

            <p>The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced magnetoelastic stress in disordered iron-gallium alloy thin films revealed by direct measurement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrián Begué, Maria Grazia Proietti, José Ignacio Arnaudas, Miguel Ciria</p>
            <p>The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.</p>

Moreover, we observe a parity-dependent directivity of high-harmonic generation where the odd- and even-order harmonics have intensities only in directions perpendicular and parallel to the polarization plane, respectively, which can be understood from dynamical symmetry of the present photodriven chiral systems.</p>

            <p>Nowotny chimney ladder (NCL) crystals present physical properties in between the contrasting paradigms of ideal crystal and amorphous solid, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric applications due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. Here, we report an extensive experimental characterization of the thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of a large class of NCL materials, focusing on the intermetallic compound Ru$_2$Sn$_{3}$. We show that the heat capacity of these NCL compounds exhibits a boson-peak-like glassy anomaly between $8$ K and $14$ K. By combining experimental measurements with density functional theory (DFT), we attribute its microscopic origin to extremely low-energy optical phonons that universally appear as a consequence of the chimney ladder sublattice structure. Additionally, the measured thermal conductivity and the thermoelectric response present distinct anomalous glass-like features that strongly correlate with the dynamics of the low-lying optical phonons revealed by DFT. Our work demonstrates that low-energy optical modes in ordered crystals can induce glassy behavior, outlining a pathway to design metallic materials with low thermal conductivity and unique thermoelectric properties without the need for disorder or strong electronic correlations.</p>

In this work, we demonstrate how the flux tunability of a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor Josephson junction based on a single full-shell nanowire enables this possibility. Near one flux quantum, $\Phi\approx \Phi_0=h/2e$, we find that the qubit system can be tuned from a gatemon regime to a parity-protected regime with qubit eigenstates localized in phase space in the $0$ and $\pi$ minima of the Josephson potential ($\cos 2\varphi_0$). Estimates of qubit coherence and relaxation times due to different noise sources are presented.</p>

            <h2>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Gioia, Ryan Thorngren</p>
            <p>We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nozomi Higashino, Yasuhiro Tada</p>
            <p>We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Long Zhang, Guangxin Ni, Junjie He, Guoying Gao</p>
            <p>Altermagnets with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room-temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308 %, TER of 707 %, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic-sensing and quantum logic nano-devices.</p>

            <p>We study the frustration pattern of a square lattice with in-situ fabricated Nb-Pt-Nb four-terminal Josephson junctions. The four-terminal geometry gives rise to a checker board pattern of alternating fluxes f, f' piercing the plaquettes, which stabilizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition even at irrational flux quanta per plaquette, due to an unequal repartition of integer flux sum f+f' into alternating plaquettes. This type of frustrated frustration manifests as a beating pattern of the dc resistance, with state configurations at the resistance dips gradually changing between the conventional zero-flux and half-flux states. Hence, the four-terminal Josephson junction array offers a promising platform to study previously unexplored flux and vortex configurations, and provides an estimate on the spatial expansion of the four-terminal Josephson junction central weak link area.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic excitations of a trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lan-Ye He, Xin-Man Ye, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>We investigate the squared sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the linear spin wave theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</p>

            <p>Precisely controlling the surface charge of zwitterionic macromolecules is crucial for tailoring their properties and optimizing them for specific applications. Here, we present a generalized calculation scheme for determining the screening length in solutions containing zwitterionic macroions, where the charge of the macroion is controlled by the electrolyte solution. This scheme bypasses the need to solve the Poisson Boltzmann equation by expressing the inverse screening parameter in terms of the derivative of pressure with respect to chemical potential. The scheme reveals that the screening length has two components: one related to the Debye length with effective charges, and another stemming from the macroion surface dissociation equilibrium, which exhibits a screening resonance behavior. Furthermore, we find that the nonuniform surface charge distribution induced by pH responsive charge regulation strongly affects the screening behavior. The charge regulation properties of macroions, even in dilute solutions, are a key factor in the screening of electrostatic interactions, offering insights into complex biological and nanomaterial systems.</p>

            <h2>Mechanical stability of resonant Bose-Fermi mixtures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian Gualerzi, Leonardo Pisani, Pierbiagio Pieri</p>
            <p>We investigate the mechanical stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature in the presence of a tunable Feshbach resonance, which induces a competition between boson condensation and boson-fermion pairing when the boson density is smaller than the fermion density. Using a many-body diagrammatic approach validated by fixed-node Quantum Monte Carlo calculations and supported by recent experimental observations, we determine the minimal amount of boson-boson repulsion required to guarantee the stability of the mixture across the entire range of boson-fermion interactions from weak to strong coupling. Our stability phase diagrams indicate that mixtures with boson-to-fermion mass ratios near two, such as the $^{87}$Rb-$^{40}$K system, exhibit optimal stability conditions. Moreover, by applying our results to a recent experiment with a $^{23}$Na-$^{40}$K mixture, we find that the boson-boson repulsion was insufficient to ensure stability, suggesting that the experimental timescale was short enough to avoid mechanical collapse. On the other hand, we also show that even in the absence of boson-boson repulsion, Bose-Fermi mixtures become intrinsically stable beyond a certain coupling strength, preceding the quantum phase transition associated with the vanishing of the bosonic condensate. We thus propose an experimental protocol for observing this quantum phase transition in a mechanically stable configuration.</p>

            <h2>Directional driving of vortex lines with oscillating magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. E. Koshelev</p>
            <p>The possibility of driving vortex lines with an oscillating magnetic field could be useful in many applications. For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices.</p>

            <p>Topological spin configurations, such as soliton-like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have emerged in recent years in both fundamental science and technological applications. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room-temperature is crucial for enabling these structures as long-range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation processes have encountered difficulties due to multi-step field training techniques and competitive interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multi-dimensional topological spin textures is desirable, as skyrmions form swirling, hedgehog-like spin structures in two dimensions, while hopfions emerge as their twisted three-dimensional counterparts. Here, we report the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion-hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modelling, the experimental observations of hopfion-skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. Our model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, all at ambient temperature. Our study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetically defined information carriers. These stable structures hold promise for ultralow-power and high-density information processing, paving the way for the next generation of topologically defined devices.</p>

The bidirectional machine is an ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both optimally by making explicit in its state structure all statistical correlation in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurement of a bit, the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming this via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to prediction and retrodiction. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable measures that characterize a process' informational structure. In addition, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of complex multivariate systems. Operationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these quantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.</p>

            <h2>Extending Collinear Density Functionals to Noncollinear Cases under Periodic Boundary Condition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Zhang, Taoni Bao</p>
            <p>Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism in materials requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a methodology was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones, successfully defining noncollinear functionals and their derivatives. However, the initial implementation involved a systematic approach to differentiate energy over density matrix elements rather than the derivatives of the energy functional with respect to density, presenting challenges for integration with periodic boundary condition-density functional theory (PBC-DFT) software. We have derived a novel set of working equations based on the original methodology, which provides noncollinear energy functionals and their derivatives. These working equations have been implemented in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, ensuring numerical stability and transferability without the need for incorporating derivatives of basis functions. This implementation is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. We demonstrate some preliminary applications in periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials, using NCXC.</p>

In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cliff Sun, Alexey Bezryadin</p>
            <p>An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.</p>

            <p>The study of magnetism in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant interest, driven by fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetic phenomena and their potential for applications in spintronic devices. Through dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we demonstrate that Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ exhibits flat-band characteristics resulting from the geometric frustration of its layered triangular lattice. These flat bands are further renormalized due to electronic correlation. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic order of Ni atoms is significantly influenced by both the Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling, indicating that the physics of Ni atoms is situated in an intermediate region between Hundness and Mottness. Additionally, our results show that Ni atoms experience significant spin fluctuations in their local moments, maintaining paramagnetism at low temperatures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of vacancies, finding a substantial suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. The physical mechanisms uncovered by our study provide a comprehensive understanding of the novel properties exhibited in this material.</p>

            <p>Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</p>

The magnetism of Yb ions appears to behave independently, which can be confirmed using resonant x-ray diffraction enhanced by a Fe atomic resonance. The inferred magnetic space group is a P(parity)T(time)-symmetric (anti-inversion collinear antiferromagnet. A linear magnetoelectric effect is allowed, as in historically important chromium sesquioxide, and Kerr rotation and the piezomagnetic effect are forbidden. Symmetry informed Bragg diffraction patterns for future x-ray and neutron experiments are shown to be rich in Fe magnetic properties of orthorhombic YbFe6Ge6, including space-spin correlations, anapoles and Dirac quadrupoles familiar in high-Tc ceramic superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Temperature-Noise Interplay in a Coupled Model of Opinion Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Chmiel, Julian Sienkiewicz</p>
            <p>We consider a coupled system mimicking opinion formation under the influence of a group of $q$ neighbors ($q$-lobby) that consists of an Ising part governed by temperature-like parameter $T$ and a voter dynamics parameterized by noise probability $p$ (independence of choice). Using rigorous analytical calculations backed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the interplay between these two quantities. Based on the theory of phase transitions, we derive the relation between $T$ and $p$ at the critical line dividing the ordered and disordered phases, which takes a very simple and generic form $T(p-a)=b$ in the high temperature limit. For specific lobby sizes, we show where the temperature are noise are balanced, and we hint that for large $q$, the temperature-like dynamics prevails.</p>

            <p>We study inverse spin and orbital Hall effects in 19 transition metals using spin-pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance. Spin-to-charge conversion was measured in YIG/X(5), while orbital-to-charge conversion was probed in YIG/Pt(2)/X(5) heterostructures. Here, X represents the different transition metals. Surprisingly, the orbital contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the spin response, clarifying the challenge of disentangling these effects. Our results largely agree with first-principles predictions for spin and orbital Hall conductivities but reveal discrepancies in select materials. These findings emphasize the fundamental role of the orbital Hall effect, and position orbitronics as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi</p>
            <p>We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance ($\kappa_{\text{th}}$) is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing platforms. Here, we challenge this prevailing notion by presenting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing Abelian phases. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle-like and hole-like integer quantum Hall states. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional (electrical and thermal) quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.</p>

            <h2>Machine learning potentials for modeling alloys across compositions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Killian Sheriff, Daniel Xiao, Yifan Cao, Lewis R. Owen, Rodrigo Freitas</p>
            <p>Materials properties depend strongly on chemical composition, i.e., the relative amounts of each chemical element. Changes in composition lead to entirely different chemical arrangements, which vary in complexity from perfectly ordered (i.e., stoichiometric compounds) to completely disordered (i.e., solid solutions). Accurately capturing this range of chemical arrangements remains a major challenge, limiting the predictive accuracy of machine learning potentials (MLPs) in materials modeling. Here, we combine information theory and machine learning to optimize the sampling of chemical motifs and design MLPs that effectively capture the behavior of metallic alloys across their entire compositional and structural landscape. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by predicting the compositional dependence of various material properties - including stacking-fault energies, short-range order, heat capacities, and phase diagrams - for the AuPt and CuAu binary alloys, the ternary CrCoNi, and the TiTaVW high-entropy alloy. Extensive comparison against experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this approach in enabling materials modeling with high physical fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simon Brunner, Christian F. Schmidt, Stefan Floerchinger</p>
            <p>We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</p>

            <h2>Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeid Ansari, R. Jafari, Alireza Akbari, Mehdi Abdi</p>
            <p>Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) have been studied in the extended XY model under both noiseless and noisy linear driven staggered field cases. In the time-independent staggered field case, the model exhibits a single critical point where the transition occurs from the spin-liquid phase to the antiferromagnetic phase. In the noiseless ramp case, unlike the transverse field XY model where DQPT always occurs for a quench crossing the single critical point, there is a critical sweep velocity above which the kinks corresponding to a DQPT are completely removed. Furthermore, in this case there are only two critical modes whose excitation probability is one-half. In the presence of a Gaussian white noise, we find that this critical sweep velocity decreases by increasing the noise strength, and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. A surprising result occurs when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are about the same order of magnitude, the number of critical modes is significantly increased, signalling a region with multiple critical modes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the scaling of the dynamical free energy near the DQPTs time is the same for both noiseless and noisy ramp quenches.</p>

            <p>In most lattice models, gap closing typically occurs at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. In the transverse field Ising model with cluster interaction, besides the gap closing at high-symmetry points, the gap closing at the quantum phase transition between paramagnetic and cluster phases of the model can be moved by tuning the strength of the cluster interaction. We take advantage of this property to examine the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model in the framework of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) after a noiseless and noisy ramp of the transverse magnetic field. The numerical results show that DQPTs always happen if the starting or ending point of the quench field is restricted between two critical points. In other ways, there is always critical sweep velocity above which DQPTs disappear. Our finding reveals that noise modifies drastically the dynamical phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical sweep velocity decreases by enhancing the noise intensity and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity for weak and strong noise. Moreover, the region with multi-critical modes induced in the dynamical phase diagram by noise. The sweep velocity under which the system enters the multi-critical modes (MCMs) region increases by enhancing the noise and scales linearly with the square of noise intensity</p>

            <p>We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.</p>

            <p>We revise the classical problem of characterizing first exit times of a harmonically trapped particle whose motion is described by one- or multi-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We start by recalling the main derivation steps of a propagator using Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. The mean exit time, the moment-generating function, and the survival probability are then expressed through confluent hypergeometric functions and thoroughly analyzed. We also present a rapidly converging series representation of confluent hypergeometric functions that is particularly well suited for numerical computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the governing Fokker-Planck operator. We discuss several applications of first exit times such as detection of time intervals during which motor proteins exert a constant force onto a tracer in optical tweezers single-particle tracking experiments; adhesion bond dissociation under mechanical stress; characterization of active periods of trend following and mean-reverting strategies in algorithmic trading on stock markets; relation to the distribution of first crossing times of a moving boundary by Brownian motion. Some extensions are described, including diffusion under quadratic double-well potential and anomalous diffusion.</p>

            <p>This paper presents a meta-theory of the usage of the free energy principle (FEP) and examines its scope in the modelling of physical systems. We consider the so-called `map-territory fallacy' and the fallacious reification of model properties. By showing that the FEP is a consistent, physics-inspired theory of inferences of inferences, we disprove the assertion that the map-territory fallacy contradicts the principled usage of the FEP. As such, we argue that deploying the map-territory fallacy to criticise the use of the FEP and Bayesian mechanics itself constitutes a fallacy: what we call the {\it map-territory fallacy fallacy}. In so doing, we emphasise a few key points: the uniqueness of the FEP as a model of particles or agents that model their environments; the restoration of convention to the FEP via its relation to the principle of constrained maximum entropy; the `Jaynes optimality' of the FEP under this relation; and finally, the way that this meta-theoretical approach to the FEP clarifies its utility and scope as a formal modelling tool. Taken together, these features make the FEP, uniquely, {\it the} ideal model of generic systems in statistical physics.</p>

            <h2>Area laws and tensor networks for maximally mixed ground states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Itai Arad, Raz Firanko, Rahul Jain</p>
            <p>We show an area law in the mutual information for the maximally-mixed state $\Omega$ in the ground space of general Hamiltonians, which is independent of the underlying ground space degeneracy. Our result assumes the existence of a `good' approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a crucial ingredient in previous area-law proofs. Such approximations have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and 2D frustration-free locally-gapped Hamiltonians. As a corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system, \begin{align*} \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big), \end{align*} where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in 1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local Hamiltonians.</p>

            <p>In this study, we explore the information capacity of open quantum systems, focusing on the effective channels formed by the subsystem of random quantum circuits and quantum Hamiltonian evolution. By analyzing the subsystem information capacity, which is closely linked to quantum coherent information of these effective quantum channels, we uncover a diverse range of dynamical and steady behaviors depending on the types of evolution. Therefore, the subsystem information capacity serves as a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic nature of various dynamical phases, such as integrable, localized, thermalized, and topological systems. We also reveal the impact of different initial information encoding schemes on information dynamics including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To support our findings, we provide representative examples for numerical simulations, including random quantum circuits with or without mid-circuit measurements, random Clifford Floquet circuits, free and interacting Aubry-André models, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models. These numerical results are further quantitatively explained using the effective statistical model mapping and the quasiparticle picture in the cases of random circuits and non-interacting Hamiltonian dynamics, respectively.</p>

            <p>State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation. The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL.</p>

            <p>Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by Lüscher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</p>

Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</p>

We show that specific sparse graphs with long-range interactions can approximate the dynamics of all-to-all spin models, such as the one-axis twisting model, even for large system sizes. The resulting sparse coupling graphs and protocol can also be efficiently implemented using dynamic reconfiguration of atoms in optical tweezers.</p>

Traditional models, including recent generalizations, often rely on the deterministic limit of stochastic processes, assuming large population sizes. However, stochasticity - arising from dispersal events and population fluctuations - profoundly shapes ecological dynamics. In this work, we extend the classical metapopulation framework to account for finite populations, examining the impact of stochasticity on species persistence and dynamics. Specifically, we analyze how the limited capacity of local habitats influences survival, deriving analytical expressions for the finite-size scaling of the survival probability near the critical transition between survival and extinction. Crucially, we demonstrate that the deterministic metapopulation capacity plays a fundamental role in the statistics of survival probability and extinction time moments. These results provide a robust foundation for integrating demographic stochasticity into classical metapopulation models and their extensions.</p>

            <p>Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</p>

We introduce and explore broad families of Lanczos coefficients that are consistent with the universal operator growth and lead to the exactly solvable dynamics. Within these families, the subleading terms of asymptotic expansion of the Lanczos sequence can be controlled and fine-tuned to produce diverse dynamical patterns.

This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</p>

            <p>Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</p>

To this end, we consider a preferential-attachment-preferential-deletion (PAPD) model, in which at each time step, with probability $P_{\rm add}$ there is a growth step where an isolated node is added to the network, followed by the addition of $m$ edges, where each edge connects a node selected uniformly at random to a node selected preferentially in proportion to its degree. Alternatively, with probability $P_{\rm del}=1-P_{\rm add}$ there is a contraction step, in which a preferentially selected node is deleted and its links are erased. The balance between the growth and contraction processes is captured by the growth/contraction rate $\eta=P_{\rm add}-P_{\rm del}$. For $0 < \eta \le 1$ the overall process is of network growth, while for $-1\le\eta<0$ the overall process is of network contraction. Using the master equation and the generating function formalism, we study the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. It is found that for each value of $m>0$ there is a critical value $\eta_c(m)=-(m-2)/(m+2)$ such that for $\eta_c(m)<\eta\le1$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$. In the special case of pure growth, where $\eta=1$, the model is reduced to a preferential attachment growth model and $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits a power-law tail, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks. In contrast, for $\eta_c(m)<\eta<1$ the distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits an exponential tail, which has a well-defined this http URL implies a phase transition at $\eta=1$, in contrast with the preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model [B. Budnick, O. Biham and E. Katzav, J. Stat. Mech. 013401 (2025)], in which the power-law tail remains intact as long as $\eta>0$.</p>

            <h2>State Engineering of Unsteerable Hamiltonians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Xuan Wang, Yuval Gefen</p>
            <p>Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</p>

            <h2>Measurement-Induced Dynamical Quantum Thermalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marvin Lenk, Sayak Biswas, Anna Posazhennikova, Johann Kroha</p>
            <p>One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here, we study, via explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces the entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to a bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.</p>

            <h2>Memorization to Generalization: Emergence of Diffusion Models from Associative Memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bao Pham, Gabriel Raya, Matteo Negri, Mohammed J. Zaki, Luca Ambrogioni, Dmitry Krotov</p>
            <p>Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomer Eini, N. M. R. Peres, Yarden Mazor, Itai Epstein</p>
            <p>Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</p>

            <h2>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tadashi Takayanagi</p>
            <p>Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</p>

            <h2>Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Felix Fritzsch, Pieter W. Claeys</p>
            <p>Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.</p>

            <h2>On the theory of supermodulation of the superconducting order parameter by supermodulation of the apex distance in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Albert M. Varonov, Todor M. Mishonov</p>
            <p>Recently using Scanning Josephson Tunneling Microscopy (SJTM) in the group of Séamus Davis a super-modulation of the superconducting order parameter induced by super-modulation of the distance $\delta$ between planar Cu and apical O was observed in [O'Mahony et al, On the electron pairing mechanism of copper-oxide high temperature superconductivity, PNAS Vol. 119(37), e2207449119 (2022)]. The authors conclude: "concurrence of prediction from strong correlation theory... with these observations indicates that... super-exchange is the electron pairing mechanism of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$." Additionally, the charge transfer energy $\mathcal{E}$, probably between O2$p_z$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ levels was studied by SJTM, too. In our current theoretical study we use LCAO approximation and Hilbert space spanned on 5 atomic orbitals: Cu$4s$, Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$, O2$p_x$, O2$p_y$, O2$p_z$. For the only super-exchange amplitude $J_{sd}$ we use the Kondo double electron exchange between Cu$4s$ and Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and its anti-ferromagnetic sign is determined by adjacent to the copper ion in-plane oxygen orbitals. Within this approximations we have calculated: "Measured dependence of... electron-pair density $n_p$ on the displacement $\delta$ of the apical O atoms from the planar Cu atoms" on [O'Mahony et al., Fig. 5C] and obtained an excellent accuracy. We discuss that the correlation between the shape of Fermi contour and the critical temperature of optimally hole-doped cuprates can be considered as an analogue of the isotope effect of phonon superconductors. The analyzed SJTM experiment is one of the best confirmations of the [J. Röhler, Plane dimpling and Cu4s hybridization in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$, Physica B: Cond. Matt. Vol. 284-288, 1041 (2000)] idea that the hybridization of Cu$4s$ with conduction band leads to increasing of $T_c$.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown of the thermodynamic limit in quantum spin and dimer models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeet Shah, Laura Shou, Jeremy Shuler, Victor Galitski</p>
            <p>The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle. Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen O. Wang, Edwin W. Huang, Brian Moritz, Thomas P. Devereaux</p>
            <p>We compute high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the Hubbard model using the unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, revealing an asymmetry between electron and hole doping. Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.</p>

            <p>We present the analytical theory of the electromagnon resonance for the multiferroics of spin origin. We consider the spin density evolution under the influence of magnetoelectric coupling in the presence of the electromagnetic wave. The dielectric permeability is found for the eigen-wave perturbations accompanied by perturbations of the electric field. The imaginary part of the dielectric permeability is found as the function of the applied electric field frequency, while the frequency of the eigen-waves is found from the dispersion equation as the function of the wave vector and parameters of the system. The result shows the existence of two peaks. One sharp peak is associated with the magnon resonance, while the second wide peak at the approximately four times smaller frequency is interpreted as the electromagnon resonance in accordance with existing experimental data.</p>

            <p>We report on an ultrafast terahertz spectroscopic study on the dynamics of free carriers and the pertinent bulk plasmons in Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te (MCT) film, a narrowband semiconductor accommodating three dimensional massless Kane fermions. The ultrabroadband terahertz source enables the investigation of the lightly doped equilibrium state in the presence of plasmon-phonon hybridization through the heavily doped excited state, primarily dominated by plasmons. Without the recourse to the resource consuming cryogenic high magnetic field spectroscopy that hinges on observable related to the interband transition, we show that the massless band dispersion can instead be conveniently perceived by the room temperature study of the intraband transition through the determination of the plasmon carrier density relationship. We found the plasma frequency in MCT scales with the cube root of carrier density, in contrast with the square root scaling in the conventional massive fermion system of parabolic band dispersion. This work also answers the curious question of whether the MCT can maintain its massless Kane fermion character in case the strict gapless condition is deviated from. The method presented herein provides a convenient approach to identifying the landscape of both massless and massive band dispersion.</p>

            <p>We study the shift current in two two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides: molybdenum diselenide (MoSSe) and tungsten diselenide (WSSe). The shift current is evaluated using a real-time approach, in which the coupling with an external field is described in terms of a dynamical Berry phase. This approach incorporates electron-hole interactions and quasiparticle band structure renormalization through an effective Hamiltonian derived from many-body perturbation theory. We find that the shift current is strongly enhanced in correspondence of C excitons. An analysis in terms of the electron-hole pairs reveals that electron and hole are localized on different atoms, and thus following an optical excitation, the center of the electron charge is shifted thus giving rise to a significant photocurrent. These results highlight the role played by excitons in the shift-current response of Janus TMDs and demonstrate that these materials are promising building blocks for future photovoltaic devices.</p>

            <p>Kagome metal AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) has emerged as an intriguing platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and other quantum states. Among the three compounds, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ has a notably lower superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) at ambient pressure, posing challenges in exploring the superconducting state. For instance, the upper critical field ($H_{c2}$) is small and thus difficult to measure accurately against other control parameters. Hence, enhancing superconductivity would facilitate $H_{c2}$ measurements, providing insights into key superconducting properties such as the dimensionality. In this letter, we report the tuning of the $T_c$ in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ through the application of biaxial strain. Utilizing a negative thermal expansion material ZrW$_2$O$_8$ as a substrate, we achieve a substantial biaxial strain of $\epsilon=1.50\%$, resulting in a remarkable 75\% enhancement in $T_c$. We investigate the $H_{c2}$ as a function of temperature, revealing a transition from multi-band to single-band superconductivity with increasing tensile strain. Additionally, we study the $H_{c2}$ as a function of field angle, revealing a plausible correlation between the $T_c$ enhancement and the change in dimensionality of the superconductivity under tensile strain. Further analysis quantitatively illustrates a transition towards two-dimensional superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ when subjected to tensile strain. Our work demonstrates that the application of biaxial strain allows for the tuning of both the $T_c$ and superconducting dimensionality in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.</p>

The superconducting gap remains robust even when the thickness of underlying BFCA is reduced to the monolayer limit, in contrast to the rapid suppression of $T_\textrm{c}$ in standalone BFCA thin films. We reveal that the exceptional crystallinity of the BaAs/BFCA heterostructures, featured by their remarkable electronic and geometric uniformities, is crucial for the emergent full-gap superconductivity with mean-field temperature dependence and pronounced bound states within magnetic vortices.

            <p>The coexistence of superconductivity and ferroelectricity is rare due to their conflicting requirements: superconductivity relies on free charge carriers, whereas ferroelectricity typically occurs in insulating systems. At LaAlO3/KTaO3 interfaces, we demonstrate the coexistence of two-dimensional superconductivity and ferroelectricity, enabled by the unique properties of KTaO3 as a quantum paraelectric. Systematic gating and poling experiments reveal a universal enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) by 0.2-0.6 K and bistable transport properties, including hysteresis, strongly suggesting the existence of switchable ferroelectric polarization in the interfacial conducting layer. Hysteresis loops indicate robust ferroelectricity below 50 K. The Tc enhancement is attributed to ferroelectric polarization-induced reduction in dielectric constant, which narrows the interfacial potential well, confining carriers closer to the interface. The bistability arises from switchable ferroelectric polarization, which modulates the potential well depending on polarization direction. These findings establish a straightforward mechanism coupling ferroelectricity and superconductivity, providing a promising platform for exploring their interplay.</p>

            <p>Endoreversible engine cycles are a cornerstone of finite-time thermodynamics. We show that endoreversible Stirling engines operating with a one-component plasma as working medium run at maximal power output with the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency. As a main result, we elucidate that this is actually a consequence of the fact that the caloric equation of state depends only linearly on temperature and only additively on volume. In particular, neither the exact form of the mechanical equation of state, nor the full fundamental relation are required. Thus, our findings immediately generalize to a larger class of working plasmas, far beyond simple ideal gases. In addition, we show that for plasmas described by the photonic equation of state the efficiency is significantly lower. This is in stark contrast to endoreversible Otto cycles, for which photonic engines have an efficiency larger than the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency.</p>

Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</p>

            <p>In this work, we present the synthesis of tin disulfide (SnS2) nanotubes (NTs) with preferred chiral angle. A sacrificial template is used to create channels of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) with an optimized diameter of 4-5 nm, inside of which SnS2 NTs are formed with the high yield and structural purity. Atomic resolution imaging and nano-area electron diffraction reveal that these synthesized SnS2 NTs prefer to have an armchair configuration with a probability of approximately 85%. Calculations using density functional theory (DFT) reveal a negligible difference in the formation energy between armchair and zigzag NTs, suggesting that structural stability does not play a key role in this chirality-selective growth. However, a detailed TEM investigation revealed that some SnS2 nanoribbons are found connected to the ends of SnS2 NTs, and that these nanoribbons primarily have a zigzag configuration. Subsequent DFT and machine learning potential molecular dynamic simulations verify that nanoribbons with zigzag configurations are more stable than armchair ones, and indeed zigzag nanoribbons aligned along the BNNT axis tend to roll up to form an armchair SnS2 NTs. Finally, this "zigzag nanoribbon to armchair nanotube" transition hypothesis is verified by in-situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, in which the transformation of SnS2 nanoribbons into a nanotube is reproduced in real time. This work is the first demonstration of preferred-chirality growth of transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes.</p>

            <h2>The many faces of rotating quantum turbulence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian Amette Estrada, Marc E. Brachet, Pablo D. Mininni</p>
            <p>Quantum turbulence shares many similarities with classical turbulence in the isotropic and homogeneous case, despite the inviscid and quantized nature of its vortices. However, when quantum fluids are subjected to rotation, their turbulent dynamics depart significantly from the classical expectations. We explore the phenomenology of rotating quantum turbulence, emphasizing how rotation introduces new regimes with no classical analogs. We review recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical developments, and present new numerical results that map out distinct dynamical regimes arising from the interplay of rotation, quantization, non-linearities, and condensed matter regimes. In particular, we show the importance of distinguishing the dynamics of rotating quantum fluids in the slowly rotating, rapidly rotating, and low Landau level regimes. The findings have implications for the dynamics of liquid helium, atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and neutron stars, and show how rotating quantum fluids can serve as a unique platform bridging turbulence theory and condensed matter physics revealing novel states of out-of-equilibrium quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Orbital Order and Superconductivity in Bilayer Nickelate Compounds</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giniyat Khaliullin, Jiří Chaloupka</p>
            <p>We propose a theory for bilayer nickelate materials, where a large tetragonal field - intrinsic or induced by epitaxial strain - lifts the orbital degeneracy and localizes the $3z^2-r^2$ orbital states. These states host local spins $S=1/2$ bound into singlets by strong interlayer coupling, and their dynamics is described by weakly dispersive singlet-triplet excitations ("triplons"). The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed.</p>

            <p>We theoretically study quasi-two-dimensional nickel compounds, where the nickel ions assume Ni$^{2+}$ $d^8$ valence state and feature a low-spin $S=0$ ground state quasidegenerate with $S=1$ ionic excitations. Such a level structure is supported by square-planar coordination of nickel ions or a suitable substitution of apical oxygens. We construct the corresponding singlet-triplet exchange model and explore its phase diagram and excitation spectrum. By hole doping, we further introduce mobile Ni$^{3+}$ $d^7$ ionic configurations with effective spins $S=1/2$, and analyze their interactions with the $d^8$ singlet-triplet background. The interplay with the triplet excitations in the $d^8$ sector is found to have a deep impact on the propagation of the doped hole-like charge carriers and is identified as a powerful source of Cooper pairing among them.</p>

            <p>We investigate the orbitally resolved superconducting properties of bulk FeSe using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We find that the spectral weights of both the large $\Delta_1$ and small $\Delta_2$ superconducting gaps remain nearly unchanged at the top Se sites as the STM tip approaches atomic contact. In contrast, the spectral weight of $\Delta_2$ increases significantly at the Fe and bottom Se sites. These results suggest that the gap $\Delta_2$ is localized in the xy-plane and likely associated with the dxy orbital band. Furthermore, we observe a long-range suppression of the large gap $\Delta_1$ near one-dimensional (1D) defects such as twin boundaries, wrinkles, and step edges, whereas $\Delta_2$ remains robust. This indicates that the two superconducting gaps respond differently to such 1D defects. High-resolution measurement using a Pb-coated tip reveals localized in-gap states near 1D defects, indicating possible defect-induced magnetism. Our findings highlight the contrasting behaviors of gap $\Delta_1$ and gap $\Delta_2$ in response to local electronic and magnetic environments and provide real-space evidence for orbital-selective superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of the excluded volume of surfactant ligands on the shape of incipient quantum dots (QDs) to which they are attached. We consider a model in which ligands are represented by hard-sphere particles that are bound to the surface of a nanoparticle (NC) that is cast in the shape of a prism. It is found in Monte Carlo simulations that the ensemble of relevant NC conformations consists of a small number of specific states that take on the form of nanoplates and nanorods. The shape of these states can be well described by the derived theoretical models. At increasing ligand density, the free energy of different states is seen to be approximately the same, suggesting that excluded volume interactions among ligands acts to narrow down the conformational space accessible to an NC without creating a statistical preference for any particular configuration.</p>

The approach is based on a modification of the canonical transformation method, which was once used to diagonalize Hamiltonians describing the interaction of electrons with phonons in a solid. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by studying the influence of photons on the spectral characteristics of atoms of quantum gases interacting with radiation. Within the framework of the developed approach, the effect of "dressing" atoms of quantum gases by a cloud of virtual photons is investigated and expressions for the energy characteristics of such dressed atoms - quasiparticles are obtained. The problem of defining the concept of the effective mass of such quasiparticles is discussed.</p>

Here we showcase on a stochastically forced version of the celebrated Lorenz '63 model the feasibility and skill of such an approach by considering different Koopman dictionaries, which allows us to treat also seamlessly coarse-graining approaches like the Ulam method.

            <p>Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.</p>

            <p>Disorder can be applied to transform conducting to insulating states by localizing individual quantum particles. The interplay between disorder and interactions in many-particle systems leads to a richer tapestry of quantum phase transitions. Here, we report the measurement in an ultracold lattice gas of a disorder-induced transition from a state with small disorder-independent compressibility to a state for which compressibility increases with disorder. At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent BG-like compressible behavior.</p>

            <p>The jamming transition between flow and amorphous-solid states exhibits paradoxical properties characterized by hyperuniformity (suppressed spatial fluctuations) and criticality (hyperfluctuations), whose origin remains unclear. Here we model the jamming transition by a topological satisfiability transition in a minimum network model with simultaneously hyperuniform distributions of contacts, diverging length scales and scale-free clusters. We show that these phenomena stem from isostaticity and mechanical stability: the former imposes a global equality, and the latter local inequalities on arbitrary sub-systems. This dual constraint bounds contact number fluctuations from both above and below, limiting them to scale with the surface area. The hyperuniform and critical exponents of the network model align with those of frictionless jamming, suggesting a new universality class of non-equilibrium phase transitions. Our results provide a minimal, dynamics-independent framework for jamming criticality and hyperuniformity in disordered systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Farhad Kamarei, Evan Breedlove, Oscar Lopez-Pamies</p>
            <p>This paper presents a macroscopic theory, alongside its numerical implementation, aimed at describing, explaining, and predicting the nucleation and propagation of fracture in viscoelastic materials subjected to quasistatic loading conditions. The focus is on polymers, in particular, on elastomers. To this end, the starting point of this work is devoted to summarizing the large body of experimental results on how elastomers deform, nucleate cracks, and propagate cracks when subjected to mechanical loads. When viewed collectively, the experiments make it plain that there are three basic ingredients that any attempt at a complete macroscopic theory of fracture in elastomers ought to account for: i) the viscoelasticity of the elastomer; ii) its strength; and iii) its fracture energy. A theory is then introduced that accounts for all these three basic ingredients by extending the phase-field theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 112 (2018), 523--551) for elastic brittle materials to seamlessly incorporate viscous energy dissipation by deformation, a generalized strength surface that is a hypersurface in stress-deformation space (and not just in stress space as for elastic brittle materials), and the pertinent Griffith criticality condition for materials that dissipate energy not just by the creation of surface but also by deformation, in this case, by viscous deformation (Shrimali and Lopez-Pamies (2023) Extreme Mech. Lett. 58, 101944). From an applications point of view, the proposed theory amounts to solving an initial-boundary-value problem comprised of two nonlinear PDEs coupled with a nonlinear ODE for the deformation field, a tensorial internal variable, and the phase field. A robust scheme is presented to generate solutions for these equations.</p>

Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Till Welker, Ricard Alert</p>
            <p>Via mechanisms not accessible at equilibrium, self-propelled particles can form phases with positional order, such as crystals, and with orientational order, such as polar flocks. However, the interplay between these two types of order remains relatively unexplored. Here, we address this point by studying crystals of active particles that turn either towards or away from each other, which can be experimentally realised with phoretic or Janus colloids or with elastically-coupled walker robots. We show that, depending on how these interactions vary with interparticle distance, the particles align along directions determined by the underlying crystalline lattice. To explain the results, we map the orientational dynamics of the active crystal onto a lattice of spins that interact via (anti-)ferromagnetic alignment with each other plus nematic alignment with the lattice directions. Our findings indicate that orientational and positional order can be strongly coupled in active crystals, thus suggesting strategies to control orientational order by engineering the underlying crystalline lattice.</p>

We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernhard E. Lüscher, Mark H. Fischer</p>
            <p>Time-reversal-symmetry breaking is generally understood to be detrimental for superconductivity. However, recent experiments found superconductivity emerging out of a normal state showing a finite anomalous Hall effect, indicative of time-reversal-symmetry breaking, in diverse systems from kagome metals, $1T'$-WS$_2$, to twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we study the stability of superconducting orders and the mechanisms that suppress superconductivity in the prototypical anomalous Hall system, the Haldane model, where complex hopping parameters result in loop-current order with a compensated flux pattern. We find that neither spin-singlet nor spin-triplet states are generically suppressed, but the real-space sublattice structure plays a crucial role in the stability of the orders. Interestingly, the nearest-neighbor chiral states of $d\pm id$ or $p\pm i p$ symmetry couple linearly to the flux, such that the two otherwise degenerate chiralities split under finite flux. As an experimental probe to distinguish the various orders in this system, we study the anomalous thermal Hall effect, $\kappa_{xy} / T$, which vanishes at zero temperature for topologically trivial superconducting states, but reaches a finite value corresponding to the Chern number in a topologically non-trivial superconducting state. Our results illustrate that broken time-reversal symmetry through a finite flux is neither generically destructive for superconductivity, nor does it imply non-trivial topological order of the emerging superconducting state. However, in the case of multiple competing pairing channels, the loop-current order can favor a chiral superconducting state.</p>

We perform Feshbach spectroscopy to observe several new interspecies resonances and characterize the bound state used for magnetoassociation. Finally, we fit the combined results to obtain improved K-Cs interaction potentials.

We find that the fractional increase in $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ obtained by employing these moves first increases rapidly with $\Delta$, then plateaus at $6-7\%$ over the range $0.10 \lesssim \Delta \leq 50$; the obtained $\phi_{\rm J}$ are as high as $0.747$ (for $\Delta = 0.50$). These density increases are achieved without producing crystallization or fractionation. SWAP and TDOF moves also reduce packings' rattler populations by as much as 96% and increase their bulk moduli by as much as 154%.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mehrana R. Nejad</p>
            <p>Starting from a three-dimensional description of an active nematic layer, we employ an asymptotic theory to derive a series of low-dimensional continuum models that capture the coupled dynamics of flat and curved films, including variations in film thickness, shape deformations, internal velocity fields, and the dynamics of orientational order. Using this asymptotic theory, we investigate instabilities driven by activity in both the nematic and isotropic phases for cylindrical and flat films. In the flat case, we demonstrate that incorporating shape and thickness variations fundamentally alters the bend and splay nature of instabilities compared to conventional two dimensional nematic instabilities. In the isotropic phase, we find that both extensile and contractile activity can induce nematic order, in contrast with active nematics on fixed surfaces, where only extensile activity leads to ordering. For the case of curved geometries such as a cylindrical film, we reveal that thickness and shape instabilities are inherently coupled. In the isotropic phase, the emergence of nematic order triggers both thickness and shape instabilities. In the nematic phase, contractile activity induces thickness instabilities, which in turn drive geometric deformations. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between activity, thickness variations, and curvature, providing new insights into the behavior of active nematic films beyond the conventional two dimensional paradigm that has been studied to date.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ankur Majumder, Sudeshna Sen</p>
            <p>The Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition is a paradigmatic phenomenon where Coulomb interactions between electrons drive a metal-insulator phase transition. It has been extensively studied within the Hubbard model, where a quantum critical transition occurs at a finite temperature second-order critical point. This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be viewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model layer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical mean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. We also provide an analytical estimate of the single-site von Neumann entanglement entropy. This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. We extend these calculations to their cluster version to incorporate short-range, non-local spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition observed in this model.</p>

            <p>Modulating liquid-to-solid transitions and the resulting crystalline structure for tailored properties is much desired. Colloidal systems are exemplary to this end, but the fundamental knowledge gaps in relating the influence of intermolecular interactions to crystallization behavior continue to hinder progress. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by studying nucleation and growth in systems with modified Lennard-Jones potential. Specifically, we study the commonly used 12-6 potential and a softer 7-6 potential. The thermodynamic state point for the study is chosen such that both systems are investigated at the same level of supercooling and pressure. Under these conditions, we find that the nucleation rate for both systems is comparable. Interestingly, the nucleation pathways and resulting crystal structures are different. In the 12-6 system, nucleation and growth occur predominantly through the FCC structure. Softening the potential alters the critical nucleus composition and introduces two distinct nucleation pathways. One pathway predominantly leads to the nucleus with a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, while the other favors the face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangement. Our study illustrates that polymorph selection can be achieved through modifications to intermolecular interactions without impacting nucleation kinetics. The results have significant implications in designing approaches for polymorph selection and modulating self-assembly mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Spintronics has emerged as a key technology for fast and non-volatile memory with great CMOS compatibility. As the building blocks for these cutting-edge devices, magnetic materials require precise characterization of their critical properties, such as the effective anisotropy field ($H_{\rm{k,eff}}$, related to magnetic stability) and damping ($\alpha$ key factor in device energy efficiency). Accurate measurements of these properties are essential for designing and fabricating high-performance spintronic devices. Among advanced metrology techniques, Time-resolved Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE) stands out for its superb temporal and spatial resolutions, surpassing traditional methods like ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). However, the full potential of TR-MOKE has not yet been fully pledged due to the lack of systematic optimization and robust operational guidelines. In this study, we address this gap by developing experimentally validated guidelines for optimizing TR-MOKE metrology across materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our work identifies the optimal ranges of the field angle to simultaneously achieve high signal amplitudes and improve measurement sensitivities to $H_{\rm{k,eff}}$ and $\alpha$. By suppressing the influence of inhomogeneities and boosting sensitivity, our work significantly enhances TR-MOKE capability to extract magnetic properties with high accuracy and reliability. This optimization framework positions TR-MOKE as an indispensable tool for advancing spintronics, paving the way for energy-efficient and high-speed devices that will redefine the landscape of modern computing and memory technologies.</p>

            <p>CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ has the paradox that low temperature static magnetic order is incompatible with the crystal structure owing to a mirror plane that exactly frustrates magnetic interactions. Despite no observable structural distortion with diffraction, CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ does magnetically order below $T_{\rm N}$ $\sim$ 25 K with the breaking of spin ground state degeneracy proposed to be a realization of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in analogy to the celebrated orbital Jahn-Teller transition. We apply neutron and Raman spectroscopy to study the dynamics of this transition in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$. We find anomalous acoustics associated with a symmetry breaking strain that characterizes the spin Jahn-Teller transition. Crucially, the energy of this phonon coincides with the energy scale of the magnetic excitations, and has the same symmetry of an optic mode, observed with Raman spectroscopy, which atypically softens in energy with decreasing temperature. Taken together, we propose that the energetics of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ are related to cooperative magnetoelastic fluctuations as opposed to conventional soft critical dynamics which typically drive large measurable static displacements.</p>

            <p>The Kondo lattice mode, as one of the most fundamental models in condensed matter physics, has been employed to describe a wide range of quantum materials such as heavy fermions, transition metal dichalcogenides and two-dimensional Moire systems. Discovering new phases on Kondo lattice and unveiling their mechanisms are crucial to the understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here, in a layered Kondo magnet USbTe, we observe a spin-textured nematic state and visualize a heavy electronic liquid-crystal phase. Employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we visualize a tetragonal symmetry breaking of heavy electronic states around the Fermi level. Through systematically investigating the temperature and energy dependence of spectroscopic data, we find that the nematic state coincides with the formation of heavy quasi-particles driven by band hybridization. Remarkably, using spin polarized STM, we demonstrate that the nematic state is spin polarized, which not only suggests its intrinsically electronic nature, but also represents the unique magnetic texture of nematic heavy fermions. Our findings unveil a novel correlation-mediated order whose mechanism is inherently tied to Kondo-lattice physics. The observation of heavy nematic states enriches the phase diagram of correlated systems and provides a rare platform to explore the interplay of Kondo physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum criticality.</p>

            <h2>A unifying perspective on measuring transient planar extensional viscosity from exponential shear</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L.A. Kroo, R.A. Nicholson, M.W Boehm, S.K. Baier, G.H. McKinley</p>
            <p>Here we present an experimentally practical and robust method to compute the transient extensional viscosity from exponential shear on a wide variety of viscoelastic complex fluids. To achieve this, we derive an analytical, frame-invariant continuum solution for the exponential shear material function, valid over all Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, we amend the original framework of Doshi and Dealy proposed in 1987 to explicitly address the effect of rotation of material elements, due to the presence of vorticity. Modern strain-controlled rheometers can access a wide range of effective Hencky strain rates in exponential shear (approximately within a range of 0.01 to 7 s^-1) and up to an effective Hencky strain of approximately 6 -- sufficient range to observe finite extensibility for many polymeric fluids. We quantify the kinematic, transducer-based, and instability-related experimental limitations of the method, establishing firm windows of data validity. The new material function is tested on a number of different example fluids. We show that these exponentially increasing strain histories are capable of producing "strong flow" -- generating stress-growth dynamics consistent with coil-stretch conformational changes in polymer solutions exhibited in extensional flows (Wi > 0.5). We then demonstrate that the method can reach finite extensibility for a 0.3 % wt. PIB solution. The method is then quantitatively validated (with no fitted parameters) against a traditional extensional technique, Capillary Break-Up Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) using the same PIB solution. Questions related to generality of this approach are addressed, including discussions on multi-mode relaxation and shear thinning.</p>

            <p>AlN has the largest bandgap in the wurtzite III-nitride semiconductor family, making it an ideal barrier for a thin GaN channel to achieve strong carrier confinement in field-effect transistors, analogous to silicon-on-insulator technology. Unlike SiO$_2$/Si/SiO$_2$, AlN/GaN/AlN can be grown fully epitaxially, enabling high carrier mobilities suitable for high-frequency applications. However, developing these heterostructures and related devices has been hindered by challenges in strain management, polarization effects, defect control and charge trapping. Here, the AlN single-crystal high electron mobility transistor (XHEMT) is introduced, a new nitride transistor technology designed to address these issues. The XHEMT structure features a pseudomorphic GaN channel sandwiched between AlN layers, grown on single-crystal AlN substrates. First-generation XHEMTs demonstrate RF performance on par with the state-of-the-art GaN HEMTs, achieving 5.92 W/mm output power and 65% peak power-added efficiency at 10 GHz under 17 V drain bias. These devices overcome several limitations present in conventional GaN HEMTs, which are grown on lattice-mismatched foreign substrates that introduce undesirable dislocations and exacerbated thermal resistance. With the recent availability of 100-mm AlN substrates and AlN's high thermal conductivity (340 W/m$\cdot$K), XHEMTs show strong potential for next-generation RF electronics.</p>

            <h2>Crystal Growth of Chalcogenides and Oxy-Chalcogenides Using Chloride Exchange Reaction</h2>

            <p>Chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides, including complex chalcogenides and transition metal dichalcogenides, are emerging semiconductors with direct or indirect band gaps within the visible spectrum. These materials are being explored for various photonic and electronic applications, such as photodetectors, photovoltaics, and phase-change electronics. Understanding the fundamental properties of these materials is crucial for optimizing their functionalities. Therefore, the availability of large, high-quality single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenides is essential for a better comprehension of their structure and properties. In this study, we present a novel crystal growth method that utilizes the exchange reaction between BaS and ZrCl$_4$/ HfCl$_4$. By carefully controlling the stoichiometric ratio of the binary sulfide to the chloride, we can grow single crystals of several materials, such as ZrS$_2$, HfS$_2$, BaZrS$_3$, and ZrOS. This method results in large single crystals with a short reaction time of 24 to 48 hours. High-resolution thin film diffraction and single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirm the quality of the crystals produced through this exchange reaction. We also report the optical properties of these materials investigated using photoluminescence and Raman measurements. The chloride exchange reaction method paves the way for the synthesis of single crystals of chalcogenides and oxy-chalcogenide systems with a short reaction time but with low mosaicity and can be an alternative growth technique for single crystals of materials that are difficult to synthesize using conventional growth techniques.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eduardo Velasco Stock, Roberto da Silva, Sebastian Gonçalves</p>
            <p>We propose a mean-field (MF) approximation for the recurrence relation governing the dynamics of $m$ species of particles on a square lattice, and we simultaneously perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under identical initial conditions to emulate the intricate motion observed in environments such as subway corridors and scramble crossings in large cities. Each species moves according to transition probabilities influenced by its respective static floor field and the state of neighboring cells. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze statistical fluctuations in the spatial distribution for $m = 1$, $m = 2$, and $m = 4$ and for different regimes of average density and biased movement. A numerical comparison is conducted to determine the best agreement between the MC simulations and the MF approximation considering a renormalization exponent $\beta$ that optimizes the fit between methods. Finally, we report a phenomenon we term "Gaussian-to-Gaussian" behavior, in which an initially normal distribution of particles becomes distorted due to interactions among same and opposing species, passes through a transient regime, and eventually returns to a Gaussian-like profile in the steady state, after multiple rounds of motion under periodic boundary conditions.</p>

Variational methods and numerical techniques were employed to solve the corresponding nonlinear equations. A disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate was analyzed to assess its radial evolution. Additionally, free expansion under rotation of the BEC was studied. Compression and expansion around the equilibrium radius were observed in different scenarios, predicting self-confinement, which implies the formation of quantum droplets originating from a BEC state. Briefly, the physical aspects of the system and the possible formation of Bose-nova effects are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry-breaking motility of an active hinge in a crowded channel</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leonardo Garibaldi Rigon, Yongjoo Baek</p>
            <p>A recent experiment [Son et al., Soft Matter, 2024, 20,2777-2788] showed that self-propelled particles confined within a circular boundary filled with granular medium spontaneously form a motile cluster that stays on the boundary. This cluster exhibits persistent (counter)clockwise motion driven by symmetry breaking, which arises from a positive feedback between the asymmetry of the cluster and those of the surrounding granular medium. To investigate this symmetry-breaking mechanism in broader contexts, we propose and analyze the dynamics of an active hinge moving through a crowded two-dimensional channel. Through extensive numerical simulations, we find that the lifetime of the hinge's motile state varies nonmonotonically with both the packing fraction of the granular medium and the strength of self-propulsion. Furthermore, we observe an abrupt transition in the configuration of passive particles that sustain hinge motility as the hinge's maximum angle relative to the channel wall increases. These findings point to the possibility of designing superstructures composed of passive granular media doped with a small number of active elements, whose dynamics modes can be switched by tuning the properties of their components.</p>

            <p>Dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) possesses characteristics different from the conventional isotropic s-wave interaction in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), the interplay of DDI with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation may induce novel quantum properties. We systematically analyze the effects of the DDI, Weyl-like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of two-componen BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of quantum states of quantum defects and quantum droplets in lattice, wheel and ring forms of distributions, with transitions of topology of density and a critical behavior in varying the parameters. We also show a bunch of exotic spin topological structures, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charge. In particular, we find quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions. Rashba-type SOC and Weyl-like SOC are compared as well. Our study implies that one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may provide various quantum resources for potential applications in quantum metrology.</p>

            <h2>Measuring Cyclic Tensile Properties of Fluids with Composite Harmonic Exponential Waveforms (CHEW)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L.A. Kroo, R.A. Nicholson, M.W Boehm, S.K. Baier, P.A. Underhill, G.H. McKinley</p>
            <p>Building off recent advances on how to practically use exponential shear in a torsional rheometer to compute transient planar extensional viscosity (Kroo et al. 2025a), we extend the technique to cyclic tensile measurements in complex fluids and soft solids. An novel input strain waveform provides a unifying approach that smoothly interpolates between exponential shear (ES) and oscillatory shear (SAOS/MAOS/LAOS) as a flow type parameter is varied. Analogous to cyclic tensile fatigue tests in solids, or the process of chewing in the oral cavity, this complex strain history is used to quantify the evolution of extensional material properties at large strains over sequential cycles of stretch. In the limit of large Hencky strain rates, the waveform locally increases exponentially and generates a period of strong material stretching. This allows for the direct computation of a transient planar extensional viscosity within specific domains of the periodic function. We demonstrate this technique on a set of model fluids, and then apply it to complex multiphase materials that mutate. These latter fluids exhibit progressive evolution in their rheological properties over repeated cycles of extensional deformation. Here we focus on two examples: a delicate foodstuff material (melted provolone cheese) which systematically decreases its extensional response over successive stretching cycles, mutating at a rate that is directly dependent on the effective Hencky strain rate. We contrast this with a PVA-borax solution which exhibits precisely the opposite effect during successive stretching cycles: increasing its planar extensional response over successive cycles, as interchain associative interactions (controlled via stretching) build structure within the fluid. These results highlight a promising new approach to study bulk extensional properties during cyclical stretching of complex fluids.</p>

            <p>In this work, we reveal giant magneto-optical responses in two-dimensional(2D) antiferromagnets with nearly flat electronic bands, based on first-principles calculations and group-theoretical analysis. We identify a record-large second-order magneto-optical Schafer-Hubert(SH) effect, featuring a polarization rotation angle of 28 degree, in monolayer antiferromagnetic RuOCl2, driven by flatband-enhanced interband optical transitions. Both the valence and conduction bands exhibit pronounced directional flatness, giving rise to highly anisotropic optical absorption and broadband hyperbolic frequency windows spanning the entire visible spectrum. This anisotropy leads to an exceptionally strong linear dichroism (LD) reaching 50%, far exceeding values reported in other 2D magnetic systems. Remarkably, the giant SH effect and LD appear at distinct photon energies, reflecting a momentum-direction-dependent crossover between flat and dispersive bands. Both responses are further amplified with increasing RuOCl2 film thickness. Our results establish flat-band antiferromagnets as a fertile platform for realizing giant nonlinear magneto-optical effects and open new avenues for 2D opto-spintronic device applications.</p>

            <p>For high-electron-mobility transistors based on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) within a quantum well, such as those based on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure, a Schottky-gate is used to maximize the amount of charge that can be induced and thereby the current that can be achieved. However, the Schottky-gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. Here, we used a ferroic HfO2-ZrO2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway to improve performance in transistors based on 2DEG.</p>

Specifically, the velocity, including both moving direction and speed can be continuously changed. The motion control of skyrmions originates from the symmetry breaking of the topological structure induced by flexoelectric-polarization effect.

            <p>MnPtGa is a hexagonal intermetallic compound with a rich variety of magnetic order. Its magnetic state is reported to range from collinear ferromagnetism, to non-collinear skyrmion type order. MnPtGa is a system with strongly localized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using calculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites stay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition temperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special emphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first principles calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy, static noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity in spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not more than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient temperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions, antiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field is applied at finite temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shreya Debnath, Kuntal Bhattacharyya, Saurabh Basu</p>
            <p>Spin-phonon coupling and its efficacy in inducing multiple topological phase transitions in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet have not been addressed in the literature. To this end, we study the ramifications of invoking optical phonons in a non-collinear antiferromagnet via two different kinds of coupling mechanisms, namely, a local and a non-local one, which are distinct in their macroscopic origin. In the case of a local spin-phonon coupling, a single phonon mode affects the magnetic interactions, whereas in the non-local case, two neighbouring phonon modes are involved in the energy renormalization, and it would be worthwhile to compare and contrast the two. To tackle these phonons, we propose an analytical approach through a canonical spin-Peierls transformation applied to magnons, that renders a hybridization between the magnons and the phonon modes and yields a magnon-polaron quasiparticle state. In both the coupling regimes, the robust support of the topological signatures is derived systematically from the bulk and edge spectral properties of the magnon-polaron bands that are characterized by their corresponding Chern numbers. Thereafter, we witness transitions from one topological phase to another solely via tuning the spin-phonon coupling strength. Moreover, these transitions significantly impact the behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity, which aid in discerning distinct topological phases. Additionally, the explicit dependencies on the temperature and the external magnetic field are explored in inducing topological phase transitions associated with the magnon-polaron bands. Thus, our work serves as an ideal platform to probe the interplay of frustrated magnetism and polaronic physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dominik Szczȩśniak</p>
            <p>Breaking the intrinsic chirality of quasiparticles in graphene enables the emergence of new and intriguing phases. One such paradigmatic example is the bond density wave, which leads to a Kekulé-ordered structure and underpins exotic electronic states where electron-phonon interactions can play a fundamental role. Here, it is shown that the relevant physics of these correlations can be resolved locally, according to the behavior of interatomic characteristics. For this purpose a robust distance-dependent framework for describing electronic structure of graphene with Kekulé bond order is presented. Given this insight, the strength of electron-phonon interactions is found to scale linearly with the electronic coupling, contributing to a uniform picture of this relationship in distorted graphene structures. Moreover, it is shown that the introduced distortion yields a strongly non-uniform spatial distribution of the pairing strength that eventually leads to the induction of periodically distributed domains of enhanced electron-phonon coupling. These findings help elucidate certain peculiar aspects of phonon-mediated phenomena in graphene, particularly the associated superconducting phase, and offer potential pathways for their further engineering.</p>

The resulting effective field theory for the noncollinear phase is an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ sigma model in which the magnonic excitation has three independent degrees of freedom and exhibits the $d$-wave-like anisotropic linear dispersion.

Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order.

We introduce Hop-Decorate (HopDec), a high-throughput, Python-based atomistic workflow that automates the generation of defect transport data in CCMs. HopDec integrates accelerated molecular dynamics with a novel redecoration algorithm to efficiently sample migration pathways across chemically diverse local environments. The method constructs a defect-state graph in which transitions are associated with distributions of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, enabling direct input into kinetic Monte Carlo and other mesoscale models. We demonstrate HopDec's capabilities through applications to a Cu-Ni alloy and the spinel oxide (Fe,Ni)Cr2O4, revealing simple predictive relationships in the former and complex migration behaviors driven by cation disorder in the latter. These results highlight HopDec's ability to extract physically meaningful trends and support reduced-order or machine-learned models of defect kinetics, bridging atomic-scale simulations and mesoscale predictions in complex material systems.</p>

            <p>The structural distortions, orbital correlations, and electronic states in cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) were investigated using complementary characterisation techniques, including SR-XRD, HAXPES, XANES, EXAFS, and Raman spectroscopy. SR-XRD confirms phase purity and reveals a temperature-dependent superlattice reflection between 200 K and 100 K, consistent with the emergence of short-range orbital ordering driven by cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion (JTD). The disappearance of this feature below 100 K signals orbital freezing and the onset of a glass-like orbital state. HAXPES measurements show multiplet splitting and charge-transfer satellite features in the Co and Fe 2p core levels, indicating mixed valence states and strong electron correlations. XANES analysis reveals hybridized p-d states and local coordination distortions. Temperature-dependent EXAFS measurements indicate increasing local disorder-particularly in Fe-O and Fe-Fe octahedral bonds as evidenced by enhanced Debye-Waller factors. These distortions, attributed to cation redistribution and oxygen vacancies, are static and asymmetric, primarily affecting the octahedral sublattice. Notably, signatures of cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions emerge in the intermediate temperature range (200-100 K) and disappear upon further cooling. Raman spectroscopy further supports these findings, revealing phonon anomalies and enhanced spin-phonon coupling in the same temperature range. Magnetic measurements indicate spin reorientation and exchange interaction anomalies that align with the orbital behaviour. Together, these results hint at a frustrated orbital state in CoFe2O4 possibly involving cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions, disrupted long-range coherence, and orbital glass behaviour offering new insights into the coupling of orbital, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spinel systems.</p>

            <h2>An investigation of the two-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Udai Prakash Tyagi, Partha Goswami</p>
            <p>This communication presents an examination of a two-dimensional, non-Hermitian Su -Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which is differentiated from its conventional Hermitian counterpart by incorporating gain and/or loss terms, mathematically represented by imaginary on-site potentials. The time-reversal symmetry is disrupted due to these on-site potentials. Exceptional points in a non-Hermitian system feature eigenvalue coalescence and non-trivial eigenvector degeneracies. Utilization of the rank-nullity theorem and graphical analysis of the phase rigidity factor enable identification of true exceptional points. Furthermore, this investigation achieves vectorized Zak phase quantization and examines a topolectric RLC circuit to derive the corresponding topological boundary resonance condition and the quantum Hall susceptance. Although Chern number quantization is not feasible, staggered hopping amplitudes corresponding to unit-cell lattice sites lead to broken inversion symmetry with non-zero Berry curvature, resulting in finite anomalous Nernst conductivity.</p>

            <p>The interplay of magnetism and superconductivity can lead to intriguing emergent phenomena. Here we combine two different two-dimensional antiferromagnetic magnet-superconductor hybrids (MSH) and study their properties using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. Both MSHs show the characteristics of a topological nodal point superconducting phase with edge modes to the trivial substrate superconductor. At the boundary between the two MSHs we find low-energy modes which are spin-polarized. Based on a tight-binding model we can explain the experimental observations by considering two different topological nodal point superconductors. This gives rise to spin-polarized chiral edge modes that connect topological nodal points of the two different MSH. We demonstrate via the complex band structure that due to an asymmetric lateral decay these edge modes are spin-polarized, regardless of the details of the spin structure at the boundary. The presence of spin-polarized edge states between different topological superconductors enables advanced functional design for the exploitation of MSHs as a platform for topology-based applications.</p>

            <h2>Optical signatures of quantum skyrmions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanchar Sharma, Christina Psaroudaki</p>
            <p>Magnets have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum computing, particularly using topologically-protected nanoscale spin textures. While the quantum dynamics of such spin textures has been theoretically studied, direct experimental evidence of their non-classical behavior remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose to employ Brillouin light scattering (BLS) as a method to probe the quantum nature of skyrmions in frustrated magnets. We show that, for a specific geometry, classical skyrmions produce symmetric sidebands in the BLS spectrum, whereas quantum skyrmions exhibit a distinct asymmetry arising from vacuum fluctuations of their rotation. By studying the photon-skyrmion interaction, we calculate the BLS spectrum using a quantum master equation and show that sideband asymmetry serves as a robust witness of energy level quantization. We find that this asymmetry is pronounced at low temperatures, and can be controlled by input laser power. These findings establish a concrete protocol for the optical detection of non-classical features in spin textures, paving the way for exploring their role in quantum applications.</p>

            <p>Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit various interesting and inter-connected spectral, topological, and boundary-sensitive features. By introducing conditional boundary conditions (CBCs) for non-Hermitian quantum systems, we explore a winding-control mechanism that selectively collapses specific periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra onto their open boundary condition (OBC) counterparts, guided by their specific winding numbers, together with a composite reconstruction of the Brillouin zone (BZ) and generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). The corresponding eigenstates also manifest nontrivial skin effects or extended behaviors arising from the interplay between BZ and GBZ structures. Furthermore, we can generalize our control by incorporating similarity transformations and holomorphic mappings with the boundary controls. We demonstrate the winding control numerically within various models, which enriches our knowledge of non-Hermitian physics across the spectrum, topology, and bulk-boundary correspondence.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aravindh S. Shankar, Jasper Steenbergen, Stephan Plugge, Koenraad Schalm</p>
            <p>We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack Griffiths, Steven A. Wrathmall, Simon A. Gardiner</p>
            <p>Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.</p>

            <p>Oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) and molybdenum trioxide (MoO$_3$) bilayer films (YHO/MoO$_3$) are produced using reactive magnetron sputtering, and their photochromic properties are investigated in relation to the thickness and density of the MoO$_3$ layer. Compared to single YHO films, the YHO/MoO$_3$ films exhibit faster coloration and larger contrast, with both parameters adjustable by varying the thickness or deposition pressure of the MoO$_3$ layer. Transparent YHO/MoO$_3$ films (~75% at 550 nm) demonstrate a photochromic contrast of up to 60%, significantly higher than the 25-30% contrast observed for single YHO films after 20 hours of UVA-violet light exposure. This enhancement arises from hydrogen intercalation from the (200)-textured polycrystalline YHO film into the X-ray amorphous MoO$_3$, leading to the formation of molybdenum bronze (HxMoO$_3$), as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and optical spectroscopies. However, the darkened YHO/MoO$_3$ films do not fully recover to their initial transparency after illumination due to the irreversible nature of the coloured MoO$_3$ layer. Most of the hydrogen intercalated into MoO$_3$ originates from the YHO layer during the initial darkening process. Furthermore, the bilayer films are chemically unstable, exhibiting gradual darkening over time even without intentional UV illumination, as confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis.</p>

            <h2>Band-like Exact Zero-energy Andreev Bound States and Superconducting Diode Effect in Mixed ${s+p}$-wave Josephson Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shu-Tong Guan, Jin An</p>
            <p>Topological Josephson junctions enable nonreciprocal transport involving Majorana fermions (MFs). Here we examine a topological Josephson junction with mixed $s$+$p$-wave pairing, where topological phase transition can be driven by adjusting the ratio between the pairing components. There exist two exact symmetrically positioned zero-energy level crossings for the Andreev-bound states, which can be shifted by external fields, and can be destroyed or recreated in pairs by a time-reversal breaking Zeeman field or inhomogeneities, exhibiting band-like structure. The dependence of the shift on the Zeeman field is linear when the two $p$-wave $\boldsymbol{d}$-vectors on both sides are identical while quadratic when they are distinct. Near the topological phase transition, the topological $p$-wave dominant junctions host MF-induced pronounced superconducting diode effect with high efficiency factor $Q$ up to 30 %, in contrast to the trivial $s$-wave dominant junctions possessing relatively small $Q$.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive ab initio study of the influence of band structure corrections, particularly the electron effective mass, on the phonon-limited electron drift and Hall mobilities of GaAs. Our approach is based on the DFT+$U$ method, combined with an iterative solution of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation using the Wannier interpolation technique. We show how this framework allows for accurate refinements of the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion, leading to improved predictions for transport properties. In particular, by varying the Hubbard parameters to purposefully tune the conduction band features, allowing us to reproduce bands with different electron effective mass, we systematically investigate the relationship between mobility and effective mass. In this context, our results show close agreement with semi-empirical relations that follow a power-law dependence. Moreover, this approach can be used to indirectly incorporate temperature effects into the band structure, enabling efficient evaluation of temperature-dependent electron mobilities. Our mobility results exhibit good agreement with experimental data and are comparable to previously reported values obtained using the computationally expensive GW method.</p>

            <p>Heterogeneous nucleation at surface edges is pervasive across nature and industry, yet the role of line tension, arising from asymmetric capillary interactions at geometric singularities, remains poorly understood. Herein we develop a generalized nucleation theory that explicitly incorporates line tension induced by edge pinning, thereby extending classical frameworks to account for nanoscale confinement and interfacial asymmetry. Through analytical treatment of droplet formation within geometrically defined nanopores, we derive a closed-form expression for the edge-pinned line tension as a function of Laplace pressure, pore geometry, and wettability. This formulation reveals that line tension can significantly reshape the nucleation energy landscape, introducing nontrivial dependencies on contact angle and pore morphology. Our results uncover a tunable, geometry-mediated mechanism for controlling nucleation barriers, offering predictive insight into phase transitions in confined environments and suggesting new strategies for design in applications ranging from nanofluidics to crystallization control.</p>

            <h2>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Boyanovsky</p>
            <p>Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</p>

            <p>The emergent properties of materials are defined by the symmetries of their underlying atomic, spin and charge order. The explorations of symmetry breaking effects are therefore usually limited by the intrinsic properties of known, stable materials. In recent years, advances in focused ion beam (FIB) fabrication have enabled the nanostructuring of bulk crystals into ultraprecise transport devices [1-4], facilitating the investigation of geometrical effects on mesoscopic length scales. In this work, we expand such explorations into three-dimensional (3D), curvilinear shapes, by sculpting helical nanostructure devices from single crystals of the high-mobility, centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ [5,6]. The combination of the imposed chiral geometry and intrinsic ferromagnetism yields nonreciprocal electron transport [7-9]. The high coercivity results in an anomalous, reversable diode effect remnant under zero applied magnetic field, which is orders of magnitude larger than can be explained by a classical self-field mechanism. We argue the enhancement originates from the high carrier mobility and the resulting quasi-ballistic transport: the conduction electron mean free path approaches the length scale of the curvature, resulting in increased asymmetrical scattering at the boundaries. We further demonstrate the inverse effect of the nonreciprocal transport: the field-free, current-induced switching of the magnetisation. The results establish the vast potential of 3D nanosculpting to explore and enrich the functionality of quantum materials.</p>

            <p>We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multi-phase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing.</p>

            <p>The many-body fixed-node and fixed-phase spin-orbit Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods are applied to accurately predict the fundamental gap of monolayer CrI$_3$ - the first experimentally-realized 2D material with intrinsic magnetism. The fundamental gap obtained, 2.9(1)~eV, agrees well with the highest peak in optical spectroscopy measurements and a previous $GW$ result. We numerically show that as expected in DMC the same value of the fundamental gap is obtained in the thermodynamic limit using both neutral promotions and the standard quasiparticle definition of the gap based on the ionization potential and electron affinity. Additional analysis of the differences between density matrices formed in different bases using configuration interaction calculations explains why a single-reference trial wave function can produce an accurate excitation. We find that accounting for electron correlation is more crucial than accounting for spin-orbit effects in determining the fundamental gap. These results highlight how DMC can be used to benchmark 2D material physics and emphasize the importance of using beyond-DFT methods for studying 2D materials.</p>

Large increases in conductivity, associated with superconducting fluctuations, are observed far above the transition temperature. However, the standard Aslamazov-Larkin paraconductivity model significantly underestimates the effect observed here. We use a model that includes conductivity corrections from normal state quasiparticle interference together with all contributions from superconducting fluctuations evaluated at arbitrary temperatures and in the short-wavelength limit. Through analysis of the magnetoconductance and resistive transitions, we find that the large conductivity increase can be explained by a combination of weak anti-localization and Maki-Thompson superconducting fluctuations. Both contributions are enabled by a strong temperature dependence of the electron's decoherence time compatible with an electron-phonon scattering scenario. We find that conductivity corrections are modulated by the electrostatic field effect, that governs a competition between normal-state quasiparticle interference and superconducting fluctuations.</p>

The single droplet is shown to be dynamically stable, which underpins its role as the basic unit in a droplet array. The stability of the droplet arrays is demonstrated by their dynamic formation from a phase engineered initial condensate. Our study sheds light onto the nature of the droplet state in a rapidly rotating BEC and offers a new approach for generating and manipulating quantum droplet arrays through designing the initial condensate phase.</p>

            <p>We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</p>

            <p>The complex physics of self-assembly in colloidal crystals on deformable interfaces and surfaces poses interesting possibilities for the designability and synthesis of next-generation metamaterials. The goal of this article is to characterize instabilities arising in colloidal crystals assembled on fluid membranes. The colloidal particles are modeled as pair-wise interacting point particles, constrained to lie on a fluid membrane and yet free to reorganize, and the membrane's elastic energy is modeled via the Helfrich energy. We find that when a collection of particles is arranged on a planar membrane in some regular fashion -- such as periodic lattice -- then the regular configuration admits bifurcations to non-planar configurations. Using the Bloch-wave anstaz for the mode of instabilities, we present a parameteric analysis of the boundary between the stable and unstable regimes. We find that instabilities can occur through two distinct kinds of modes, when the parameters belong in certain physically interesting regimes, referred to as long-wavenumber modes ($L$ modes) and short-wavenumber modes ($S$ modes) in the article. We discuss some connections between these results and recent experiments, as well as the open problem of budding in biomembranes.</p>

            <h2>Quantitative correlation between structural (dis-)order and diffuseness of phase transition in lead scandium tantalate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Granzow, A. Aravindhan, Y. Nouchokgwe, V. Kovacova, S. Glinsek, S. Hirose, T. Usui, H. Uršič, I. Goričan, W. Jo, C.-H. Hong, E. Defay</p>
            <p>Ferroelectrics show a phase transition to a paraelectric phase at a well-defined transition temperature. Introducing disorder makes this transition diffuse, and the system becomes a relaxor. Since the degree of (dis-)order is usually manipulated by varying the chemical composition, it is difficult to establish a direct relationship between disorder and the degree of diffuseness. Perovskite structured lead scandium tantalate (Pb[Sc$_{1/2}$Ta$_{1/2}$]O$_3$, PST) offers the opportunity to tune the character of the transition by thermal annealing without changing the stoichiometry. Here it is demonstrated that there is a linear correlation between the structural ordering, quantified by the intensity ratio $S$ of the pseudocubic (111)/(200) x-ray diffraction peaks, and the diffuseness parameter $\gamma$ deduced from temperature-dependent dielectric spectroscopy. The relation is universal, independent of whether the sample is a thin film, multilayer capacitor or bulk ceramic, and also independent of the absolute value of the dielectric permittivity.</p>

            <h2>Cascade at local yield strain for silica and metallic glass</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nandlal Pingua, Himani Rautela, Roni Chatterjee, Smarajit Karmakar, Pinaki Chaudhuri, Shiladitya Sengupta</p>
            <p>We report observations of unusal \emph{first} plastic events in silica and metallic glasses in the shear startup regime at applied strain two orders of magnitude smaller than yield strain. The (non-Affine) particle displacement field during these events have complex real space structure with multiple disconnected cores of high displacement appearing at the \emph{same} applied strain under athermal quasistatic simple shear deformation, and identified by a ``cell based cluster analysis'' method. By monitoring the stress relaxation during the first plastic event by Langevin dynamics simulation, we directly show the cascade nature of these events. Thus these first plastic events are reminiscent of avalanches in the post-yielding steady state, but unlike the steady state avalanches, we show that these events are not system spanning. To understand the nature of these events, we tune three factors that are known to affect brittleness of a glass. These are (i) sample preparation history, (ii) inter-particle interactions and (iii) rigidity of the background matrix applying a ``soft matrix'' probe recently developed by some of us. In each case we show that such first plastic events are more probable in more ductile glasses. Our observations are consistent with the picture that more ductile materials are softer, implying that understanding the role of softness may be a promising route to develop microscopic quantifiers of brittleness and thus clarifying the physical origin of brittle-to-ductile transition.</p>

            <h2>Unraveling the Robust Superconductivity Phenomenon of High-Entropy Alloy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam D. Smith, Wenjun Ding, Yogesh K. Vohra, Cheng-Chien Chen</p>
            <p>Recent experiments demonstrate a "robust superconductivity phenomenon" in niobium-based alloys, where the superconducting state remains intact and the critical temperature ($T_c$) is largely unaffected by external pressure well above tens of gigapascal (GPa) into the megabar regime ($\ge 100 GPa$). Motivated by these observations, we perform first-principles electron-phonon calculations for body-centered cubic Nb and NbTi crystals, as well as for special quasi-random structures of Nb$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$ and (NbTa)$_{0.7}$(HfZrTi)$_{0.3}$ high-entropy alloy (HEA). The calculations unravel the underlying mechanism of robust superconductivity, stemming from a compensation effect between varying electronic and phonon properties under pressure. The results also reveal how structural and chemical disorders modify the superconducting state. The first-principles $T_c$ values agree quantitatively with the experiments throughout the entire pressure range under study. Our work thereby paves the way for exploring superconducting HEAs under pressure via advanced first-principles simulations.</p>

            <p>We employ a procedure that enables us to calculate the excess free energies for a finite Ising cylinder with domain walls analytically. This procedure transparently covers all possible configurations of the domain walls under given boundary conditions and allows for a physical interpretation in terms of coarse-grained quantities such as surface and point tensions. The resulting integrals contain all the information about finite-size effects; we extract them by careful asymptotic analysis using the steepest descent method. To this end, we exactly determine the steepest descent path and analyse its features. For the general class of integrals, which are usually found in the study of systems with inclined domain walls, knowledge of the steepest descent path is necessary to detect possible intersections with poles of the integrand in the complex plane.</p>

            <h2>How universal is the mean-field universality class for percolation in complex networks?</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Cirigliano</p>
            <p>Clustering and degree correlations are ubiquitous in real-world complex networks. Yet, understanding their role in critical phenomena remains a challenge for theoretical studies. Here, we provide the exact solution of site percolation in a model for strongly clustered random graphs, with many overlapping loops and heterogeneous degree distribution. We systematically compare the exact solution with mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity, correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the mean-field. These findings highlight the need for new approaches, beyond the heterogeneous mean-field theory, to accurately describe phase transitions in complex networks with realistic topological features.</p>

            <p>Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far. Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far from equilibrium.</p>

            <h2>Advancing Stochastic 3-SAT Solvers by Dissipating Oversatisfied Constraints</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Schwardt, J. C. Budich</p>
            <p>We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm, coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.</p>

            <h2>Generalized Petermann factor of non-Hermitian systems at exceptional points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julius Kullig, Jan Wiersig, Henning Schomerus</p>
            <p>The nonorthogonality of modes in open systems significantly modifies their resonant response, resulting in quantitative and qualitative deviations from Breit-Wigner resonance relations. For isolated resonances with a Lorentzian lineshape, the deviations amount to an enhancement of the resonance linewidth by the Petermann factor (PF), given by the overlap of left and right eigenmodes of the underlying effectively non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The PF diverges at exceptional points (EPs), where resonance frequencies degenerate, and right and left eigenmodes are orthogonal to each other. This divergence signifies a qualitative departure from a Lorentzian lineshape, which has gained recent attention. In this work, we extend this concept to EPs, and describe how this EP PF manifests in a variety of physical scenarios. Firstly, we identify this PF in physical terms as an enhancement of the response of a system to external or parametric perturbations. Utilizing two natural orthogonally projected reference systems based on the right and left eigenvectors, we show that each choice carries a precise geometric interpretation that naturally extends the notion of the PF for isolated resonances to EPs. The two choices can be combined into an overall EP PF, which again can be expressed in purely geometric terms. Secondly, we illuminate the geometric mechanisms that determine the size of the EP PF, by considering the role of modes participating in the degeneracy and those that remain spectrally separated. Thirdly, we design a system to study the EP PF in a specific physical setup, consisting of two microrings coupled to a waveguide with embedded semitransparent mirrors. This example shows our approach yields a more accurate spectral response strength than conventional truncation. These results complete the description of systems at EPs in the same way as the original PF does for isolated resonances.</p>

            <p>This work presents a unified perspective on thermal equilibrium and quantum dynamics by examining the simplest quantum system, a qubit, as a foundational model. We show that both the thermal partition function and the Loschmidt amplitude can be understood as extensions of a single analytic function along different paths in the complex plane. The zeros of Loschmidt amplitude encode dynamical features such as orthogonality, rate function singularities, and quantum speed limits, in analogy with the role of partition function zeros in equilibrium statistical mechanics. We further establish, through the Cauchy-Riemann equations, that the high-temperature specific heat corresponds to early-time evolution. The discussion follows a pedagogical progression from a single qubit to an interacting spin chain.</p>

            <p>Quantitative visualization of internal deformation fields in crystalline materials helps bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. Applying Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions provides a promising approach to the longstanding challenge of investigating the deformation fields in micron-sized crystals. Here, we present an automatic differentiation-based Artificial Intelligence method that integrates dynamical scattering theory to accurately reconstruct deformation fields in large crystals. Using this forward model, our simulated and experimental results demonstrate that three-dimensional local strain information inside a large crystal can be accurately reconstructed under coherent X-ray dynamical diffraction conditions with Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. These findings open an avenue for extending the investigation of local deformation fields to microscale crystals while maintaining nanoscale resolution, leveraging the enhanced coherence and brightness of advanced X-ray sources.</p>

            <p>Utilizing quantum effects in nanoscopic devices has in the past mostly been accessible through academic cleanrooms and research foundries. Opening the quantum frontier for wider industrial applications likely requires the scale of well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries for manufacturing transistor-based quantum devices operable above subkelvin temperatures. Here, we operate a commercial 22-nm-node fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS device as dual parallel-connected charge-pumps for the implementation of a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure the accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A for this scalable architecture at 50 MHz with reference to SI-traceable voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. Looking ahead we propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel-connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This can be operated as a table-top primary standard, generating quantum currents up to microampere levels.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eran Bouchbinder</p>
            <p>Frictional sliding, e.g., earthquakes along geological faults, are mediated either by frictional crack-like ruptures, where interfacial (fault) slip is accumulated during the entire sliding event, or by frictional pulse-like ruptures, featuring a finite length over which slip is accumulated. Our basic understanding of slip pulses, which are believed to dominate most crustal earthquakes, is still incomplete. Here, building on recent progress, we present an analytic equation of motion for rate-and-state frictional slip pulses, which are intrinsically unstable spatiotemporal objects, in terms of a single degree of freedom. The predictions of the equation are supported by large-scale simulations of growing pulses and reveal the origin of the slow development of their instability, which explains the dynamic relevance of pulses in a broad range of natural and manmade frictional systems.</p>

            <p>The decay of electrical charge on a dielectric surface in nitrogen-C4F7N (Novec4710, C4) mixtures is investigated using measurement of electric field via in-situ electric field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) technique. The charge is deposited on the surface of the alumina by generating a barrier discharge in the gap, and the amount of charge is determined from electrical current measurements and numerical modeling. For different admixtures (0, 10, and 50 percent) of C4F7N in nitrogen, the presence of surface charge is detected even 60 hours after charge deposition. It is found that C4F7N admixture lead to a significantly longer-lasting surface charge, indicating a slower charge decay. Using an isothermal charge decay model, charge traps are identified for pure nitrogen charge deposition, which are in agreement with results found in the literature. Charge deposition in C4F7N admixtures leads to modification or creation of new traps with higher trap energies. The EFISH measurements are used to determine the C4F7N nonlinear hyperpolarizability tensor component. Direct comparison of the experimental results from two developed methods (EFISH and electrical measurements) and the numerical model gives a closer insight into the surface charge spread over the dielectrics, resulting in surface charge density estimation.</p>

            <p>The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincaré group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT). We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS. Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</p>

Furthermore, plasmonic resonances demonstrate stability across the entire spectral bandwidth, enhancing the attractiveness of bismuth nanoparticles for applications over a wide spectral range.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hana Vargová</p>
            <p>We rigorously analyze the global tripartite entanglement in a Heisenberg trimer with mixed spins-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) under varying exchange couplings between dissimilar and identical spins, magnetic fields, and temperatures. The global tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all three bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map the regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous global entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite entangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities among the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability of global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special attention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a real three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa stands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes $1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of the mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement in this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic fields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation of robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable. The magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching a value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a connection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement, quantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities measured directly or indirectly from various experiments.</p>

            <p>The genuine tetrapartite entanglement of a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg tetramer is quantified according to the three different approaches incorporated all seven global bisections existing within the tetrapartite system. The degree of entanglement of each bisection is evaluated through the bipartite negativity at zero and non-zero temperature taking into account ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic type of intra- ($J$) and inter-dimer ($J_1$) exchange coupling inside the square plaquette. Three utilized quantification methods based on the generalization of (i) a genuine tripartite negativity, (ii) a Coffman, Kundu and Wootters monogamy relation and (iii) a geometric average of complete trisections, result to the qualitatively and almost quantitatively identical behavior of a genuine tetrapartite negativity. It is shown that the genuine tetrapartite negativity exclusively arises from the antiferromagnetic-inter dimer $J_1>0$ coupling, whereas the character of with respect to $J$ ($J>0$ or $J<0$) determines its zero-temperature magnitude and its thermal stability with respect to the magnetic field and temperature. As is demonstrated for $0<J_1/J<1$ the genuine tetrapartite negativity is dramatically reduced due to the preference of magnetic arrangement involving two separable mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimers. In an opposite limit the genuine tetrapartite negativity is significantly stable with a threshold temperature proportional to the strength of an inter-dimer coupling $J_1$. It is found, that all three quantification procedures are insufficient to correctly describe the genuine tetrapartite negativity in a specific part of the parameter space with absence of relevant dimer separable states. Finally, the thermal stability of a genuine tetrapartite negativity is discussed in detail for selected geometries motivated by the real tetranuclear bimetallic complexes with a Cu$_2$Ni$_2$ magnetic core.</p>

            <h2>Dislocations and crystallization dynamics of chiral soliton lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Minoru Eto, Kentaro Nishimura, Muneto Nitta</p>
            <p>Dislocations, as topological defects in crystal lattices, are fundamental to understanding plasticity in materials. Similar periodic structures also arise in continuum field theories, such as chiral soliton lattices (CSLs), which appear in condensed matter systems like chiral magnets and in high-energy contexts such as quantum chromodynamics in strong magnetic field or under rapid rotation. This work investigates whether dislocations can dynamically form within such emergent CSLs. The chiral sine-Gordon model, reduced from the aforementioned examples by certain truncations, is useful to determine the ground state but it cannot describe time evolution, lacks dynamical formation or leads to singular dislocations, because its equations of motion do not contain a topological term. We propose a field-theoretical model including the topological term coupled to external fields resolving these issues by modifying the topological term so it affects the dynamics. Using numerical simulations, we study the real-time formation of CSLs in two and three spatial dimensions. In 2D, edge dislocations emerge spontaneously, guiding soliton growth and later annihilating to leave a stable CSL. In 3D, both edge and screw dislocations form; the latter exhibits helical structure influenced by the external field. We find stable double helical screw dislocations looking like a double helix staircase or DNA. We then demonstrate the formation of helical dislocations and analyze how the external field strength affects CSL density and formation speed. Our results provide a novel theoretical framework for understanding dislocations in solitonic structures, connecting high-energy field theory with materials science phenomena.</p>

Although the information scrambling in the closed systems has been proposed and tested in the digital circuits, how to measure the evolution of quantum correlations between systems and environments remains a delicate and open question. Here, we propose a photonic circuit to investigate the information scrambling in an open quantum system by implementing the collision model with cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We numerically simulate the photon propagation and find that the tripartite mutual information strongly depends on the system-environment and environment-environment interactions. We further reduce the number of observables and the number of shots required to reconstruct the density matrix by designing an enhanced compressed sensing. Our results provide a reconfigurable photonic platform for simulating open quantum systems and pave the way for exploring controllable dissipation and non-Markovianity in discrete-variable photonic computing.</p>

            <h2>Operator-space fragmentation and integrability in Pauli-Lindblad models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawid Paszko, Christopher J. Turner, Dominic C. Rose, Arijeet Pal</p>
            <p>The Lindblad equation for open quantum systems is central to our understanding of coherence and entanglement in the presence of Markovian dissipation. In closed quantum systems Hilbert-space fragmentation is an effective mechanism for slowing decoherence in the presence of constrained interactions. We develop a general mechanism for operator-space fragmentation of mixed states, undergoing Lindbladian evolution generated by frustration-free Hamiltonians and Pauli-string jump operators. The interplay of generator algebras of dissipative and unitary dynamics leads to a hierarchical partitioning of operator and real space into dynamically disconnected subspaces, which we elucidate using the bond and commutant algebras of superoperators. This fragmentation fundamentally constrains information spreading in open systems and provides new mechanisms to control highly entangled quantum states and dynamics. Our approach yields two key advances. Firstly, we introduce frustration graphs in operator space as a compact representation to construct effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in individual fragments and diagnose their free-fermion solvability. Secondly, using these methods we uncover a range of universal dynamical regimes in Pauli-Lindblad models, exhibiting symmetry enriched quantum chaos and integrability in operator-space fragments. Furthermore, we show dissipation-driven phase transitions corresponding to exceptional points in the Lindbladian spectrum whose signatures are captured by spectral statistics and operator dynamics. These results establish operator-space fragmentation as a fundamental principle for open quantum systems, with immediate implications for quantum error correction, where protected subspaces could emerge naturally from fragmentation. Our framework provides a systematic approach to discover and characterize novel non-equilibrium phases in open quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Polar solitons in a nonpolar chiral soft matter system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiahao Chen, Xingzhou Tang, Yang Ding, Susanta Chakraborty, Satoshi Aya, Bingxiang Li, Yanqing Lu</p>
            <p>Polar solitons, i.e., solitonic waves accompanying asymmetry of geometry or phase, have garnered attention in polar systems, such as ferroelectric or magnetoelectric materials, where they play a critical role in topological transitions and nonreciprocal responses to external fields. A key question is whether such polar solitons can emerge in nonpolar systems, where intrinsic polarity is absent. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented polar soliton with nematic order in a nonpolar and chiral liquid crystal system by applying an alternating electric field. The soliton is corn-kernel-shaped, displaying a pair of oppositely charged topological defects at its two ends. While head-to-head collision between the solitons leads to repulsion, head-to-tail collision attracts the solitons into a single polar soliton. A rich variety of solitonic kinetics, such as rectilinear translation and circulation motions, can be activated by controlling the voltage and frequency of an electric field. Simulations reveal that the formation of the polar solitons is achieved through balancing the electric and nematic elastic energies, while the flexoelectric effect drives their rotational behaviors. The discovery of polar solitons in nonpolar systems expands the understanding of topological solitons, opening new avenues for dynamic control in soft matter systems, with potential applications in nonreciprocal responsive materials and topological information storage.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guillermo Serrera, Yoshito Y. Tanaka, Pablo Albella</p>
            <p>Light-matter interactions generally involve momentum exchange between incident photons and the target object giving rise to optical forces and torques. While typically weak, they become significant at the nanoscale, driving intense research interest in the exploitation of photon recoil to drive micro- and nanostructures. While great progress has been attained in controlling transversal degrees of freedom, three-dimensional movement remains challenging, particularly due to the impractical realization of pulling forces that oppose the direction of incident light. Here we theoretically present a novel nanomotor design that enables control over both transverse and longitudinal motion. This design exploits coupling between an azimuthally polarized Bessel beam and a dielectric glass cylinder to realistically achieve optical pulling forces. At the same time, asymmetric plasmonic dimers, embedded within the cylinder, provide lateral motion, through asymmetric scattering under plane wave illumination. We further demonstrate that unwanted displacements and rotations can be restrained, even at long illumination times. Our design unlocks a new degree of freedom in motion control, allowing for pulling, pushing, and lateral movement by simply tuning the polarization or switching between plane waves and Bessel beams.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seungjae Lee, Lennart J. Kuklinski, Moritz Thümler, Marc Timme</p>
            <p>The emergence of synchrony essentially underlies the functionality of many systems across physics, biology and engineering. In all established synchronization phase transitions so far, a stable synchronous state is connected to a stable incoherent state: For continuous transitions, stable synchrony directly connects to stable incoherence at a critical point, whereas for discontinuous transitions, stable synchrony is connected to stable incoherence via an additional unstable branch. Here we present a novel type of transition between synchrony and incoherence where the synchronous state does not connect to the state of incoherence. We uncover such transitions in the complexified Kuramoto model with their variables and coupling strength parameter analytically continued. Deriving a self-consistency equation for a quaternion order parameter that we propose helps to mathematically pin down the mechanisms underlying this transition type. Local numerical analysis suggests that the transition is linked to a Hopf bifurcation destabilizing synchrony, in contrast to branching point bifurcations established for the transition between synchrony and incoherence so far.</p>

            <p>We propose a robust approach to spin squeezing with local interactions that approaches the Heisenberg limit of phase sensitivity. To generate the requisite entanglement, we generalize the paradigmatic two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian -- akin to squeezing by parametric amplification -- to systems with power-law interactions, incorporating a Heisenberg coupling that aids in spreading correlations and protects the collective spin coherence. The resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aferdita Xhameni, Antonio Lombardo</p>
            <p>We demonstrate high accuracy classification for handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset ($\sim$98.00$\%$) and RGB images from the CIFAR-10 dataset ($\sim$86.80$\%$) by using resistive memories based on a 2D van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). These memories are fabricated via dry thermal oxidation, forming vertical crossbar HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ devices with a highly-ordered oxide-semiconductor structure. Our devices operate without electroforming or current compliance and exhibit multi-state, non-volatile resistive switching, allowing resistance to be tuned using voltage pulse trains. Using low-energy potentiation and depression pulses (0.7V-0.995V, 160ns-350ns), we achieve 31 ($\sim$5 bits) stable conductance states with high linearity, symmetry, and low variation over 100 cycles. Key performance metrics-such as weight update, quantisation, and retention-are extracted from these experimental devices. These characteristics are used to simulate neural networks with our resistive memories as weights. Neural networks are trained on state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital hardware (CUDA cores) and a baseline inference accuracy is extracted. IBM's Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit (AIHWKIT) is used to modify and remap digital weights in the pretrained network, based on the characteristics of our devices. Simulations account for factors like conductance linearity, device variation, and converter resolution. In both image recognition tasks, we demonstrate excellent performance, similar to SOTA, with only $<$0.07$\%$ and $<$1.00$\%$ difference in inference accuracy for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively. The forming-free, compliance-free operation, fast switching, low energy consumption, and high accuracy classification demonstrate the potential of HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$-based resistive memories for energy-efficient neural network acceleration and neuromorphic computing.</p>

We also show a scheme to render an interpretable "PathMap", showing the free energy ridges between paths, as well as the branching and merging of the transition channels.

            <p>Nanoscale defects such as dislocations, have a significant impact on the phonon thermal transport properties in non-metallic materials. To unravel these effects, understanding of defect phonon modes is essential. Herein, at the atomic scale, the localized phonons of individual dislocation at a Si/Ge interface are measured via monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope. These modes are then correlated with the local microstructure, further revealing the dislocation effects on the local thermal transport properties. The dislocation causes phonon redshift in several milli-electron-volts within about two to four nanometers of the core, where both of the strain field and Ge-segregation play roles. With the presence of dislocation, the local interfacial thermal conductance can be either enhanced or reduced, depending on the complex interaction and competition between lattice-disorder (dislocation) and element-disorder (heterointerface mixing and Ge-segregation) at the interface. These findings provide valuable insights to improve the thermal properties of thermoelectric generators and thermal management systems through proper defect engineering.</p>

            <p>Achieving strong interactions in fermionic many-body systems is a major theme of research in condensed matter physics. It is well-known that interactions between fermions can be mediated through a bosonic medium, such as a phonon bath or Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here we show that such induced attraction can be resonantly enhanced when the bosonic medium is a two-component spinor BEC. The strongest interaction is achieved by tuning the boson-boson scattering to the quantum critical spinodal point of the BEC where the sound velocity vanishes. The fermion pairing gap and the superconducting critical temperature can thus be dramatically enhanced. We propose two experimental realizations of this scenario, with exciton-polariton systems in two-dimensional semiconductors and ultracold atomic Bose-Fermi mixtures.</p>

            <p>The application of in-plane magnetic fields to Josephson junctions enables fundamental exploration of quantum phenomena, including Zeeman-driven 0-$\pi$ transitions and planar topological superconductivity. However, intrinsic orbital effects arising from nanoscale rippled geometries in practical devices can dominate phase interference signatures, complicating their interpretation. Here, we experimentally probe superconducting interference in NbTiN weak-link Josephson junctions under combined perpendicular and in-plane magnetic fields. The critical supercurrent reveals a distinct diamond-shaped interference pattern, with nodes progressively opening and evolving into V-shaped features, reminiscent of suppression-recovery patterns associated with 0-$\pi$ transitions. We theoretically analyze the interplay between orbital effects from rippled geometries and non-uniform supercurrent density distributions, demonstrating that their synergistic interaction could reproduce the experimentally observed interference evolution. Our findings elucidate how geometric imperfections and current inhomogeneity cooperatively reshape phase interference, providing critical insights into orbital-dominated phenomena in Josephson systems.</p>

            <h2>Force Dipole Interactions in Tubular Fluid Membranes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samyak Jain, Rickmoy Samanta</p>
            <p>We construct viscous fluid flow sourced by a force dipole embedded in a cylindrical fluid membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. We find analytic expressions for the flow, in the limit of infinitely long and thin tubular membranes. We utilize this solution to formulate the in-plane dynamics of a pair of pusher-type dipoles along the cylinder surface. We find that a mutually perpendicular dipole pair move together along helical geodesics, thus acting as curvature checkers, analogous to vortex dipoles. Since the cylindrical geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane, there is a difference in flows along the axial and transverse directions of the cylinder. This in turn leads to anisotropic hydrodynamic interaction between the dipoles and is remarkably different from flat and spherical fluid membranes. In particular, the flow along the compact direction of the cylinder has a local rigid rotation term (independent of the angular coordinate but decays along the axis of the cylinder). Due to this feature of the flow, we observe that the interacting dipole pair initially situated along the axial direction exhibits an overall drift along the compact angular direction of the tubular fluid membrane. We find that the drift for the dipole pair increases linearly with time. Our results are relevant for non-equilibrium dynamics of motor proteins in tubular membranes arising in nature, as well as in-vitro experiments (25).</p>

This bound, which implies a high energy dissipation for fast, low-noise operations (such as switching a bit in a digital memory), brings together recent results of stochastic thermodynamics into a form that is usable for practical nonlinear electronic circuits, as we illustrate on a switching circuit made of an nMOS pass gate in a state-of-the-art industrial technology.</p>

            <p>The rise of moiré materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee a Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely "ideal" or "vortexable" quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level, while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first (1LL), where non-Abelian states at $\nu = 1/2,2/5$ are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field , and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. We apply the definition to identify two models with 1LL structure -- a toy model of double bilayer twisted graphene and a more realistic model of strained Bernal graphene.</p>

            <p>Using a state-of-the-art numerical scheme, we show that the Higgs mode under excitation exhibits chirped oscillations and exponential decay when fluctuations are included. This is in stark contrast to conventional BCS collisionless dynamics which predict power-law decay and the absence of chirping. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived prethermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photoinduced (super)current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the order parameter dynamics, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response involves long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.</p>

            <p>Conventional topological materials rely on band-specific mechanisms -- such as band inversion or spin-orbit coupling -- to realize nontrivial topological invariants. Here, we introduce a symmetry-driven paradigm for generating topological states, exploiting a translational symmetry $\mathcal{L}$ that couples two maximal Wyckoff positions. This symmetry induces robust band degeneracies independent of band structure details, allowing us to classify $\mathcal{L}$ as trivial or nontrivial by quantized electric multipoles. Crucially, for nontrivial $\mathcal{L}$, symmetry-protected edge and corner states emerge universally across all symmetry-compatible insulating, semi-metallic, and metallic phases, irrespective of specific band structure. We demonstrate this in a $C_4$-symmetric model and validate it using an experimentally feasible dielectric photonic crystal engineered with $\mathcal{L}$ symmetry. Through full-wave simulation, we observe directional edge modes and localized corner modes, with the former selectively excited by harmonic point sources spatially shifted by $\mathcal{L}$ at a fixed frequency.</p>

            <p>We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</p>

            <p>We theoretically investigate the transport signature of single and multiple Floquet Majorana end modes~(FMEMs), appearing in an experimentally feasible setup with Rashba nanowire~(NW) placed in closed proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, in the presence of an external Zeeman field. Periodic drive causes the anomalous $\pi$-modes to emerge in addition to the regular $0$-modes in the driven system where the former does not exhibit any static analog. For single $0$- and/or $\pi$-FMEM, differential conductance exhibits a quantized value of $2e^{2}/h$ while we consider the sum over all the photon sectors, supporting Floquet sum rule. We examine the stability of this summed conductance against random onsite disorder. We further investigate the summed conductance in several cases hosting multiple~(more than one) $0$- or $\pi$-modes at the end of the NW. In these cases, we obtain quantized values of $n_{M}\times 2e^{2}/h$ in summed differential conductance with $n_{M}$ being the number of modes~($0$ or $\pi$) localized at one end of the NW. We repeat our analysis for another experimentally realizable model system known as helical Shiba chain. Moreover, we corroborate our results by computing the differential conductance for FMEMs using non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our work opens up the possibility of studying the transport signatures of FMEMs in these realistic models.</p>

            <p>We analyze the impact of spatial non-locality and losses in the electromagnetic response of graphene on the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. To this purpose, we calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the recent experiment in PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021) and PRB {\bf 104}, 085436 (2021). We calculated the CLF using three different models for the electromagnetic response of graphene: electric conductivity using a non-local and lossy Kubo model, electric conductivity using the local and lossy Kubo model, and the non-local and lossless polarization operator model. The relation between these three models has been recently explored in PRB {\bf 111}, 115428 (2025). We show that, for the parameters of the available experiments, the theoretical predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical (having a relative differences smaller than $10^{-3}$). This implies that for those given experiments, both non-local and lossy effects in the graphene response are completely negligible. We also find that this experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions for the involved materials (gold and graphene). Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model for the electric conductivity, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations. We also show how the Polarization tensor must be used and modified in general, for phenomena needing a more fine response function, i.e. requiring both the spatial non-locality and losses.</p>

            <p>The moiré structure of AB-stacked $\rm{MoTe_2/WSe_2}$ represents a natural platform to realize Kondo lattice models, due to the discrepancy of the bandwidth between the individual layers. Here, we study this system at the commensurate filling of $\nu_{\rm tot}=2$. Our focus is on the $1+1$ filling setting of $\nu_{\rm Mo} =\nu_{\rm W}=1$, which enables a Kondo lattice description. We find a Kondo semimetal due to the sizable intra-orbital hopping among the electrons in the $\rm{MoTe_2}$ layer. The Kondo-driven (emergent) flat band is naturally pinned to the Fermi energy. When combined with the inherent topology of the electronic structure, a topological Kondo semimetal phase ensues. We calculate the valley Hall response and, due to the breaking of inversion symmetry, also identify a spontaneous Hall effect. There is a Berry curvature dodecapole, which leads to a fourth-order spontaneous Hall effect in the perturbative regime of the electric field that is further amplified in the non-perturbative regime. As such, the system provides a tunable setting to simulate topological Kondo semimetals. Finally, we discuss the pathways that connect the physics realized here to the Weyl Kondo semimetals and their proximate phases that have been advanced in recent years in topological Kondo lattice models and materials.</p>

In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes of the scalar field. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</p>

            <h2>Suppression of the Mott insulating phase in the particle-hole asymmetric Hubbard model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mateus Marques, Bruno M. de Souza Melo, Alexandre R. Rocha, Caio Lewenkopf, Luis G. G. V. Dias da Silva</p>
            <p>We explore the phase diagram of the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT), focusing on the effects of particle-hole asymmetry (PHA) in the single-band Hubbard model. Our dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study reveals that the introduction of PHA in the model significantly influences the critical temperature ($T_c$) and interaction strength ($U_c$), as well as the size of the co-existence region of metallic and insulating phases at low temperatures. Specifically, as the system is moved away from particle-hole symmetry, $T_c$ decreases and $U_c$ increases, indicating a suppression of the insulating phase and the strengthening of the metallic behavior. Additionally, the first-order transition line between metallic and insulating phases is better defined in the model with PHA, leading to a reduced co-existence region at $T<T_c$. Moreover, we propose that the MIT can be characterized by the charge density, which serves as a viable alternative to zero-frequency spectral density typically used in DMFT calculations. Our findings provide new insights into the role of particle-hole asymmetry in the qualitative and quantitative characterization of the MIT even in a very simple system.</p>

            <h2>Exciton-Enhanced Superconductivity in Monolayer Films of Aluminum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhui Cao, Alexey Kavokin</p>
            <p>The BCS theory has achieved widespread success in describing conventional superconductivity. However, when the length scale reaches the atomic limit, the reduced dimensionality may lead to the quantum breakdown resulting in unpredictable superconducting behaviors. It has been exper imentally evidenced that the critical temperature is strongly enhanced in the monolayer films of FeSe/STO and epitaxial Aluminum. Here, we propose the exciton mechanism of superconductivity as a possible reason for the enhanced superconductivity in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor structures. The exciton-induced Cooper pairing may lead to the larger energy gaps and higher critical temperatures as compared to those caused by the phonon induced superconductivity. A detailed comparison of the theory and experimental results of Ref. 1 reveals the possibility of exciton-induced superconductivity in thin films of Aluminum near the monolayer limit.</p>

            <h2>Global thermodynamic manifold for conservative control of stochastic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jordan R. Sawchuk, David A. Sivak</p>
            <p>Optimal control of stochastic systems plays a central role in nonequilibrium physics, with applications in the study of biological molecular motors and the design of single-molecule experiments. While exact analytic solutions to optimization problems are rare, under slow driving conditions, the problem can be reformulated geometrically solely in terms of equilibrium properties. In this framework, minimum-work protocols are geodesics on a thermodynamic manifold whose metric is a generalized friction tensor. Here, we introduce a new foundation for this friction-tensor formalism for conservatively driven systems. Under complete control of the potential energy, a global thermodynamic manifold (on which points are identified with instantaneous energy landscapes) has as its metric a full-control friction tensor. Arbitrary partial-control friction tensors arise naturally as inherited metrics on submanifolds of this global manifold. Leveraging a simple mathematical relationship between system dynamics and the geometry of the global manifold, we derive new expressions for the friction tensor that offer powerful tools for interpretation and computation of friction tensors and minimum-work protocols. Our results elucidate a connection between relaxation and dissipation in slowly driven systems and suggest optimization heuristics. We demonstrate the utility of these developments in three illustrative examples.</p>

            <h2>Boundary topological insulators and superconductors of Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold classes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun-Jiang Luo, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>In a class of systems, there are gapped boundary-localized states described by a boundary Hamiltonian. The topological classification of gapped boundary Hamiltonians, same as the standard tenfold way for gapped bulk states, can lead to the emergence of boundary topological insulators (TIs) and superconductors (TSCs). In this work, we present a theoretical study of boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes. Based on the boundary projection analyses for a $d$-dimensional Dirac continuum model, we demonstrate that nontrivial boundary topology can arise at a $(d-n)$-dimensional boundary if the Dirac model incorporates ($n+1$) mass terms with $0<n<d$ although its bulk and $(d-1)$D, $\cdots$, $(d-n+1)$D boundaries are topologically trivial. Furthermore, we present a unified criterion for the emergence of nontrivial boundary topology by extending bulk classification within the context of the Dirac model, which provides a unified framework for nontrivial bulk and boundary topology. Inspired by the Dirac continuum model analysis, we further construct bulk lattice Hamiltonians for realizing boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes, which enables the realization of higher-order TIs and TSCs in arbitrary dimensions with arbitrary orders. We analyze some typical examples of the constructed boundary TIs and TSCs in physical dimensions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aiden V. Harbick, Mark K. Transtrum</p>
            <p>Modern superconducting radio frequency (SRF) applications demand precise control over material properties across multiple length scales - from microscopic composition, to mesoscopic defect structures, to macroscopic cavity geometry. We present a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) framework that incorporates spatially varying parameters derived from experimental measurements and ab initio calculations, enabling realistic, sample-specific simulations. As a demonstration, we model Sn-deficient islands in Nb$_3$Sn and calculate the field at which vortex nucleation first occurs for various defect configurations. These thresholds serve as a predictive tool for identifying defects likely to degrade SRF cavity performance. We then simulate the resulting dissipation and show how aggregate contributions from multiple small defects can reproduce trends consistent with high-field $Q$-slope behavior observed experimentally. Our results offer a pathway for connecting microscopic defect properties to macroscopic SRF performance using a computationally efficient mesoscopic model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeong-Tark Han, Jae Sung Lee, Jae-Hyung Jeon</p>
            <p>Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) delineate tradeoff relations between the thermodynamic cost and the magnitude of an observable's fluctuation. While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan C. Petit, Saswati Ganguly, Matthias Sperl</p>
            <p>We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in synthetic methods enable designing subunits that self-assemble into structures with precise, finite sizes and well-defined architectures, but yields are frequently suppressed by the formation of off-target metastable structures. Increasing the complexity (the number of distinct subunit types) can inhibit off-target structures, but leads to slower kinetics and higher synthesis costs. Here, we study icosahedral shells formed of programmable triangular subunits as a model system, and identify design principles that produce the highest target yield at the lowest complexity. We use a symmetry-based construction to create a range of design complexities, starting from the maximal symmetry Caspar-Klug assembly up to the fully addressable, zero-symmetry assembly. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the most prominent defects leading to off-target assemblies are disclinations at sites of rotational symmetry. We derive symmetry-based rules for identifying the optimal (lowest-complexity, highest-symmetry) design that inhibits these disclinations, leading to robust, high-fidelity assembly of targets with arbitrarily large, yet precise, finite sizes. The optimal complexity varies non-monotonically with target size, with `magic' sizes appearing for high-symmetry designs in which symmetry axes do not intersect vertices of the triangular net. The optimal designs at magic sizes require 12 times fewer inequivalent interaction-types than the (minimal symmetry) fully addressable construction, which greatly reduces the timescale and experimental cost required to achieve high fidelity assembly of large targets. This symmetry-based principle for pruning off-target assembly generalizes to diverse architectures with different topologies.</p>

            <h2>System-independent lower bounds on entropy production incurred by running a computer program</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Abhishek Yadav, Francesco Caravelli, David Wolpert</p>
            <p>Mismatch cost (MMC) is a universally applicable lower bound on both the entropy production (EP) of any fixed physical process across a given time interval. In this work we use MMC for the first time to lower-bound the amount of work dissipated by running a high-level or assembler-level computer program. To begin, we extend previous results concerning MMC to prove that it scales at least linearly with the total heat flow in the worst case over initial distributions. This establishes that - in contrast to results like the thermodynamic speed limit theorem or thermodynamic uncertainty relations - it is often a substantial fraction of the work dissipated on macroscopic scales. We also prove that the MMC lower bound over a given time interval never decreases if the time interval is subdivided into a sequence of sub-intervals, and that the bound often increases. Armed with these results, we then introduce a general framework for computing the minimal EP (i.e., the MMC) associated with running any computer program on any physical system that implements a modern digital computer. Crucially, this framework holds completely independently of the microscopic physical details of that system. Next we apply this general framework to compare lower bounds on the EP incurred by running two canonical sorting algorithms, bubble sort and Bucket sort. This enables us to investigate how thermodynamic cost depends on features like input size and structure (e.g., with or without repeated entries). Finally, we extend the framework to programs that call subroutines.</p>

            <h2>A minimal tensor network beyond free fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carolin Wille, Maksimilian Usoltcev, Jens Eisert, Alexander Altland</p>
            <p>This work proposes a minimal model extending the duality between classical statistical spin systems and fermionic systems beyond the case of free fermions. A Jordan-Wigner transformation applied to a two-dimensional tensor network maps the partition sum of a classical statistical mechanics model to a Grassmann variable integral, structurally similar to the path integral for interacting fermions in two dimensions. The resulting model is simple, featuring only two parameters: one governing spin-spin interaction (dual to effective hopping strength in the fermionic picture), the other measuring the deviation from the free fermion limit. Nevertheless, it exhibits a rich phase diagram, partially stabilized by elements of topology, and featuring three phases meeting at a tricritical point. Besides the interpretation as a spin and fermionic system, the model is closely related to loop gas and vertex models and can be interpreted as a parity-preserving (non-unitary) circuit. Its minimal construction makes it an ideal reference system for studying non-linearities in tensor networks and deriving results by means of duality.</p>

            <p>Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</p>

            <p>Tungsten-based low-activation high-entropy alloys are possible candidates for next-generation fusion reactors due to their exceptional tolerance to irradiation, thermal loads, and stress. We develop an accurate and efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the W-Ta-Cr-V system and use it in hybrid Monte Carlo molecular dynamics simulations of ordering and segregation to all common types of defects in WTaCrV. The predictions are compared to atom probe tomography analysis of segregation and precipitation in WTaCrV thin films. By also considering two other alloys, WTaV and MoNbTaVW, we are able to draw general conclusions about preferred segregation in refractory alloys and the reasons behind it, guiding future alloy design and elucidating experimental observations. We show that the experimentally observed CrV precipitates in WTaCrV form semicoherent bcc-to-bcc interfaces with the surrounding matrix, as coherent precipitates are not thermodynamically stable due to excessive lattice mismatch. The predictions from simulations align well with our atom probe tomography analysis as well as previous experimental observations.</p>

            <p>We propose a mechanism which can generate supercurrents in spin-orbit coupled superconductors with charged magnetic inclusions. The basic idea is that through spin-orbit interaction, the in-plane electric field near the edge of each inclusion appears to the electrons as an effective spin-dependent gauge field; if Cooper pairs can be partially spin polarized, then each pair experiences a nonzero net transverse pseudo-gauge field. We explore the phenomenology of our mechanism within a Ginzburg-Landau theory, with parameters determined from a microscopic model. Depending on parameters, our mechanism can either enhance or reduce the total magnetization upon superconducting condensation. Given an appropriate distribution of inclusions, we show how our mechanism can generate superconducting vortices without any applied orbital magnetic field. Our mechanism can produce similar qualitative behavior to the ``magnetic memory effect'' observed in 4Hb-TaS$_2$. However, the magnitude of the effect in that material seems larger than our model can naturally explain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peter Lunts, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev</p>
            <p>We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without translational symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi liquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje (arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.</p>

            <p>Orbital selectivity is pivotal in dictating the phase diagrams of multiorbital systems, with prominent examples including the orbital-selective Mott phase and superconductivity, etc. The intercalation of anisotropic layers represents an effective method for enhancing orbital selectivity and, thereby shaping the low-energy physics of multiorbital systems. Despite its potential, related experimental studies remain limited. In this work, we systematically examine the interplay between orbital selectivity and magnetism in the newly discovered anisotropic kagome TbTi3Bi4 single crystal, and report a unidirectional, orbital-selective band reconstruction within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. By combining soft X-ray and vacuum ultraviolet angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements with orbital-resolved density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify that the band reconstruction is a manifestation of the AFM order, driven by a 1/3 nesting instability of the intercalated Tb 5dxz orbitals. Such an orbital-selective modulation leads the unusual momentum-dependent band folding and the emergence of symmetry-protected Dirac cones only at the M1 point. More importantly, the discovery of orbital-selective 3 x 1 AFM order offers crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of the fractional magnetization plateau in this Kagome AFM metal. Our findings not only underscore the essential role of both conducting and localized electrons in determining the magnetic orders of LnTi3Bi4 (Ln = Lanthanide) kagome metals but also offer a pathway for manipulating magnetism through selective control of anisotropic electronic structures.</p>

Using the multiflavor representation for the multipolar magnetic moments, we can show the crossover or transition from the pure inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism to the pure multipolar origin for the ferroelectricity, and also incorporate the intermediate regime with the mixture of both origins. We expect our results to inspire a reexamination of ferroelectricity in the multipolar-ordered magnets.</p>

            <p>We consider a Geometric Brownian Information Engine to explore the effects of finite cycle time $(\tau)$ on the extractable work, power, and efficiency. We incorporate an error-free feedback controller that converts the information obtained about the state of overdamped Brownian particles, confined within a 2-D monolobal geometry, into extractable work. The performance of the information engine depends on the cycle period $(\tau)$, measurement distance $(x_m)$, and feedback location $(x_f)$ of the controller. Upon increasing the feedback cycle time, the engine transitions from a high non-equilibrium steady state to a completely relaxed state. We set the measurement distance at an optimum position related to a fully relaxed state ($x_m^* \sim 0.6 \sigma$). When the cycle time is finite and short ($\tau <\tau_r$), the best information processing occurs with a shorter distance of the feedback site. While increasing the cycle time towards a fully relaxed state ($\tau \gg \tau_r$), the maximum extractable work that can be achieved with a feedback location is set to be twice that of $x_m^*$, as expected. When the cycle time ($\tau$) is longer than the relaxation time ($\tau_r$), the maximum power is achieved when the scaled feedback location is exactly double the optimum measurement distance ($x_f^{*}=2x_m^*$). In contrast, when $\tau < \tau_r$, the maximum power is achieved when the feedback site is set at a lower value. As the $\tau$ increases, the maximum average power decreases. In the limit of a long $\tau$, the highest efficiency as well extractable work is attained when $x_f$ is located at $2x_m$, regardless of the level of entropic control. As the dominance of entropic control increases, the extractable work and efficiency in the fully relaxed state decrease due to higher information loss during relaxation.</p>

            <p>An ab initio scheme based on the Kubo-Greenwood linear response theory of exchange torque correlation is presented to calculate intrinsic Gilbert damping parameters in magnets of reduced dimensions. The method implemented into the real-space Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (RS-KKR) Greens' function framework enables to obtain diagonal elements of the atomic-site-dependent on-site and non-local Gilbert damping tensor. Going from the 3D bulk and surfaces of iron and cobalt ferromagnets addressed in our previous work [Phys. Rev. B 109, 094417 (2024)], in the present paper monolayers of Fe and Co on (001)- and (111)-oriented Cu, Ag, and Au substrates are studied, and particularly the substrate-dependent trends are compared. Furthermore, the Gilbert damping parameters are calculated for Fe and Co adatoms and dimers on (001)-oriented substrates. It is investigated how the damping parameter of single adatoms depends on their vertical position. This dependence is quantified in relation to the adatoms' density of states at the Fermi energy showing a non-monotonic behavior. By rotating the spin moment of the adatoms and collinear magnetic dimers, an anisotropic behavior of the damping is revealed. Finally, a significant, three- to ten-times increase of the on-site Gilbert damping is found in antiferromagnetic dimers in comparison to the ferromagnetic ones, whilst the inter-site damping is even more enhanced.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taiki Sato, Hiroaki Ishizuka</p>
            <p>Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moiré graphene.</p>

            <h2>Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daan Verraes, Tom Braeckevelt, Nick Bultinck, Veronique Van Speybroeck</p>
            <p>We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

            <h2>Bayesian Selection for Efficient MLIP Dataset Selection</h2>

            <p>The problem of constructing a dataset for MLIP development which gives the maximum quality in the minimum amount of compute time is complex, and can be approached in a number of ways. We introduce a ``Bayesian selection" approach for selecting from a candidate set of structures, and compare the effectiveness of this method against other common approaches in the task of constructing ideal datasets targeting Silicon surface energies. We show that the Bayesian selection method performs much better than Simple Random Sampling at this task (for example, the error on the (100) surface energy is 4.3x lower in the low data regime), and is competitive with a variety of existing selection methods, using ACE and MACE features.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L. L. Lage, A. B. Félix, S. dos A. Sousa-Júnior, A. Latgé, Tarik P. Cysne</p>
            <p>We study the spectral properties and local topology of the Kane-Mele-Rashba model on a Sierpinski Carpet (SC) fractal, constructed from a rectangular flake with an underlying honeycomb arrangement and open boundary conditions. When the system parameters correspond to a topologically trivial phase, the energy spectrum is characterized solely by bulk states that are not significantly modified by the system's fractality. For parameters corresponding to the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, in addition to bulk states, the energy spectrum exhibits in-gap topological states that are strongly influenced by the fractal geometry. As the fractal generation increases, the in-gap topological states acquire a staircase profile, which translates into sharp peaks in the density of states. We also show that both the QSHI and the trivial phase exhibit a large gap in the valence-projected spin spectrum, allowing the use of the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) to index the local topology of the system. Fractality does not affect this gap, allowing the application of LSCM to higher fractal generations. Our results explore the LSCM versatility, showing its potential to access local topology in complex geometries such as fractal systems.</p>

            <h2>Magneto-rotation coupling for ferromagnetic nanoelement embedded in elastic substrate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Grzegorz Centała, Jarosław W. Kłos</p>
            <p>This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the magnetization, and the aspect ratio of the strip cross-section. We analyze the changes of the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field with an increasing thickness-to-width ratio, assuming a fixed magnetization direction corresponding to the strongest magnetoelastic coupling. For Love wave, the contribution of the out-of-plane component increases monotonically, while that of the in-plane component decreases monotonically. In the case of the Rayleigh wave, only the out-of-plane component contributes, and it approaches zero as the cross-section becomes square. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> John C. Sunil, Richard A. Blythe, Martin R. Evans, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We consider a discrete-time continuous-space random walk, with a symmetric jump distribution, under stochastic resetting. Associated with the random walker are cost functions for jumps and resets, and we calculate the distribution of the total cost for the random walker up to the first passage to the target. By using the backward master equation approach we demonstrate that the distribution of the total cost up to the first passage to the target can be reduced to a Wiener-Hopf integral equation. The resulting integral equation can be exactly solved (in Laplace space) for arbitrary cost functions for the jump and selected functions for the reset cost. We show that the large cost behaviour is dominated by resetting or the jump distribution according to the choice of the jump distribution. In the important case of a Laplace jump distribution, which corresponds to run-and-tumble particle dynamics, and linear costs for jumps and resetting, the Wiener-Hopf equation simplifies to a differential equation which can easily be solved.</p>

            <p>Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.</p>

            <h2>Collective modes in superconductors including Coulomb repulsion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joshua Althüser, Götz S. Uhrig</p>
            <p>We numerically study the collective excitations present in isotropic superconductors including a screened Coulomb interaction. By varying the screening strength, we analyze its impact on the system. We use a formulation of the effective phonon-mediated interaction between electrons that depends on the energy transfer between particles, rather than being a constant in a small energy shell around the Fermi edge. This justifies considering also rather large attractive interactions. We compute the system's Green's functions using the iterated equations of motion (iEoM) approach, which ultimately enables a quantitative analysis of collective excitations. For weak couplings, we identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) mode at the two-particle continuum's lower edge and the phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) mode at $\omega = 0$ for a neutral system, which shifts to higher energies as the Coulomb interaction is switched on. As the phononic coupling is increased, the Higgs mode separates from the continuum, and additional phase and amplitude modes appear, persisting even in the presence Coulomb interactions.</p>

            <h2>Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liam L.H. Lau, Andreas Gleis, Daniel Kaplan, Premala Chandra, Piers Coleman</p>
            <p>We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.</p>

            <p>We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</p>

            <h2>Image of helical local moment magnetic order in the STM spectrum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Akbari, Peter Thalmeier</p>
            <p>The surface tunneling microscope (STM) method probes the itinerant conduction electron spectrum which is influenced by the presence of collective order parameters. It may in fact be used as a tool to obtain important information about their microscopic nature, for example the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. Surprisingly it has been found that the STM spectrum can also identify magnetic order of completely localised electrons, e.g., incommensurate helical structure of 4f electron moments, as observed in the compound GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. This is due to the fact that the exchange coupling of conduction states to the localised subsystem reconstructs the itinerant bands which then leaves an imprint on the STM spectrum. We develop a theory based on this idea that shows firstly the appearance of STM satellite peaks at the wave vector of localised moment helical order for the pure surface. Secondly we derive the quasiparticle interference spectrum in Born approximation due to the presence of surface impurities which contains information on the reconstruction process of itinerant states caused by the localised helical order. Furthermore we show that within full $t$-matrix approach impurity bound states are also influenced by the exchange coupling to helical magnetic order.</p>

            <p>We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</p>

            <p>We compute the phase separation of the immiscible liquid alloy Fe-Cu-Ni. Our computational approach uses a virtual semigrand canonical Widom approach to determine differences in excess chemical potentials between different species. Using an embedded atom potential for Fe-Cu-Ni, we simulate liquid states over a range of compositions and temperatures. This raw data is then fit to Redlich-Kister polynomials for the Gibbs free energy with a simple temperature dependence. Using the analytic form, we can determine the phase diagram for the ternary liquid, compute the miscibility gap and spinodal decomposition as a function of temperature for this EAM potential. In addition, we compute density as a function of composition and temperature, and predict pair correlation functions. We use static structure factors to estimate the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (the $S^0$ method) and compare with our fit Gibbs free energy. Finally, using a nonequilibrium Hamiltonian integration method, we separately compute absolute Gibbs free energies for the pure liquid states; this shows that our endpoints are accurate to within 1 meV for our ternary Gibbs free energy, as well as the absolute Gibbs free energy for the ternary liquid.</p>

            <p>According to Zaanen's interpretation of Homes' empirical law~[Zaanen, {\it Nature} {\bf 430}, 512 (2004)], the superconducting transition temperatures in the cuprates are high because their metallic states are as viscous as quantum mechanics permits. Here, we show that Homes' law in fact implies three key points: (i) the resistivity is linear in temperature in the normal state near the transition temperature; (ii) the dimensionless coefficient of proportionality of the relaxation rate with temperature is of order unity -- the so-called universal Planckian relaxation rate; and (iii) the logarithmically broad applicability of this law arises from an unusually wide range of effective masses throughout the cuprate phase diagram. In fact, a universal Planckian relaxation rate implies Homes' law only if the mechanism of mass renormalization is independent of the Planckian relaxation.</p>

            <p>The revised Chen's derivative rule for electron tunneling is implemented to enable computationally efficient first-principles-based calculations of the differential conductance dI/dV for scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) simulations. The probing tip is included through a single tip apex atom, and its electronic structure can be modeled as a linear combination of electron orbitals of various symmetries, or can be directly transferred from first-principles electronic structure calculations. By taking pristine and boron- or nitrogen-doped graphene sheets as sample surfaces, the reliability of our implementation is demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained by the Tersoff-Hamann and Bardeen's electron tunneling models. It is highlighted that the energy-resolved direct and interference contributions to dI/dV arising from the tip's electron orbitals result in a fingerprint of the particular combined surface-tip system. The significant difference between the electron acceptor boron and donor nitrogen dopants in graphene is reflected in their dI/dV fingerprints. The presented theoretical method allows for an unprecedented physical understanding of the electron tunneling process in terms of tip-orbital-resolved energy-dependent dI/dV maps, that is anticipated to be extremely useful for investigating the local electronic properties of novel material surfaces in the future.</p>

            <p>We observe strongly nonlinear spin dynamics in ferro-/antiferro-magnetic multilayers, controlled by the number of bilayers in the system, layer thicknesses, as well as temperature, peaking in magnitude near the Néel point of the antiferromagnetic layers just above room temperature. Well above the Néel transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled and resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the Néel point, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic spacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the film normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes, comparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers. These findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear spin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well below the Néel transition, the FeMn layers order strongly antiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively make the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the high-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal gating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the demonstrated material can approach 100\%, large compared to nonlinear materials used in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single percentage level.</p>

            <h2>Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Kishigi, Yasumasa Hasegawa</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.</p>

            <p>In this work, we obtain the expression, within the linear response approximation, that allows the direct calculation of the superfluid weight for strongly inhomogeneous superconductors. Using this expression, we find that, in general, the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the superconductor's pairing potential to the perturbing vector potential is important in superconductors with a strongly inhomogeneous pairing potential. We consider two exemplary cases: the case when strong inhomogeneities in the pairing potential are induced by a periodic potential, and the case when superconducting vortices are induced by an external magnetic field. For both cases we show that the correction to the superfluid weight due to the response of the paring potential to the perturbing vector potential can be significant, it must be included to obtain quantitatively correct results, and that for the case when vortices are present the expression of the superfluid weight that does not include such correction returns qualitatively wrong results.</p>

            <p>Migdal-Eliashberg theory (METh) of boson-mediated superconductivity contains a $\sqrt{\lambda}$ divergence in the critical temperature $T_c$ at strong electron-boson coupling $\lambda$. In conventional METh, the strong-coupling regime can be accessed only in the limit that $\lambda_E = \lambda \, \omega_D/\varepsilon_F\ll1$, where $\omega_D$ is the Debye frequency and $\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. Here we go beyond this restriction in the context of the two-dimensional Yukawa-SYK (Y-SYK) model, which is solvable for arbitrary values of $\lambda_E$. We find that $T_c\approx 0.18 \,\omega_D \sqrt{\lambda}$ for large $\lambda$, provided $\lambda_E$ remains small, and crosses over to a universal value of $T_c \approx 0.04\, \varepsilon_F$ for large $\lambda_E$. The saturation of $T_c$ is due to a self-consistent account of the boson dynamics for large $\lambda_E$ and is arguably qualitatively valid beyond the Y-SYK framework. In particular, depending on the value of $\lambda$, this self-consistent approach leads to pairing that describes multiple classes of quantum critical electronic systems. These results demonstrate how the $\sqrt{\lambda}$ growth of $T_c$ in METh saturates to a universal value independent of $\lambda$ and $\omega_D$, providing an upper bound on the critical temperature at strong electron-boson coupling.</p>

            <p>The term altermagnetism has recently been introduced to describe the Néel order of a class of materials whose magnetic sublattices are neither related by translation nor inversion. While these materials arguably have large technological potential, little effort has been devoted to studying the universal distinction of this phase of matter compared to collinear antiferromagnetism. Employing a recently proposed minimal microscopic model, we explicitly derive a nonlinear sigma model describing long-wavelength fluctuations of the staggered magnetization in this system, including quantum effects to leading order. The term that distinguishes the altermagnetic nonlinear sigma model from its antiferromagnetic counterpart is an interaction term that derives directly from the Berry phase of the microscopic spin degrees of freedom. Its effects on the one-loop renormalization group flow in $d=2+1$ dimensions are examined. Extending the theory to describe the fermionic excitations of the metallic altermagnet, we find an effective low-energy model of $d$-wave spin-split Dirac fermions interacting with the magnetic fluctuations. Using a Dyson-Schwinger approach, we derive the many-body effects on the dynamical critical scaling due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb interaction and the fluctuations of the staggered magnetization.</p>

            <p>Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</p>

As emergent fundamental excitations, they are predicted to collectively reshape observable equilibrium and dynamical properties. Small individual Bethe strings have recently been observed in quantum magnets and superconducting qubits. However, creating states featuring intermixtures of many, including large, strings remains an outstanding experimental challenge. Here, using nearly integrable ultracold Bose gases, we realize such intermixtures of Bethe strings out of equilibrium, by dynamically tuning interactions from repulsive to attractive. We measure the average binding energy of the strings, revealing the presence of bound states of more than six particles. We find further evidence for them in the momentum distribution and in Tan's contact, connected to the correlated density. Our data quantitatively agree with predictions from generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). Manipulating intermixtures of Bethe strings opens new avenues for understanding quantum coherence, nonlinear dynamics and thermalization in strongly-interacting 1D systems.</p>

            <p>We have recently developed a breakthrough methodology for rapidly computing entropy in both solids and liquids by integrating a multiscale entropy approach (known as zentropy theory) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables entropy estimation from a single MD trajectory by analyzing the probabilities of local structural configurations and atomic distributions, effectively addressing the long-standing challenge of capturing configurational entropy. Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical investigation of interface atomic structure of graphene on NiFe alloy substrate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naohiro Matsumoto, Ryusuke Endo, Mitsuharu Uemoto, Tomoya Ono</p>
            <p>Two processes have been proposed to fabricate graphene/NiFe alloy interfaces for tunneling magnetoresistance devices. One is the transfer of graphene and the other is the evaporation of alloys onto graphene. The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.</p>

            <h2>Multisetting protocol for Bell correlated states detection with spin-$f$ systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arkadiusz Kobus, Xinwei Li, Mariusz Gajda, Li You, Emilia Witkowska</p>
            <p>We propose a multisetting protocol for the detection of two-body Bell correlations, and apply it to spin-nematic squeezed states realized in $f$ pairs of SU(2) subsystems within spin-$f$ atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Experimental data for $f=1$, alongside with numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner method for $f=1,\,2,\,3$, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Our findings extend the reach of multisetting Bell tests in ultracold atomic system, paving the way for extended quantum information processing in high-spin ensemble platforms.</p>

            <h2>Decoupling Electric Field and Temperature-Driven Atomistic Forming Mechanisms in TaOx/HfO2-Based ReRAMs using Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simanta Lahkar, Valeria Bragaglia, Behnaz Bagheri, Donato Francesco Falcone, Matteo Galetta, Marilyne Sousa, Aida Todri-Sanial</p>
            <p>Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have shown unique multi-level resistive switching capabilities. However, the physical processes governing their behavior, and specifically the atomistic mechanisms of forming, remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the forming mechanism at the atomic level using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. An extended charge equilibration scheme, based on a combination of the charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) formalism and the electrochemical dynamics with implicit degrees of freedom (EChemDID) method, is employed to model the localized effects of applied voltage. Our simulations reveal that tantalum ions exhibit the highest displacement under applied voltage, followed by hafnium ions, while oxygen ions respond only minimally. This results in the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode (anode), and the clustering of oxygen vacancies near the negative bottom electrode (cathode), where the conductive filament nucleates. This ionic segregation partially shields the bulk dielectric from the applied electric field, hindering further migration of ions in the vertical direction. We find that a minimum threshold voltage is required to initiate vacancy clustering. Filament growth proceeds through a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which are stabilized near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.</p>

            <h2>Pilot-waves and copilot-particles: A novel approach to objective collapse</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Axel van de Walle</p>
            <p>We propose an extension of Schrödinger's equation that incorporates the macroscopic measurement-induced wavefunction collapse phenomenon. Our approach relies on a hybrid between Bohm-de Broglie pilot-wave and objective collapse theories. The Bohmian particle is guided by the wavefunction and, conversely, the wavefunction gradually localizes towards the particle's position. As long as the particle can visit any state, as in a typical microscopic system, the localization effect does not favor any particular quantum state and, on average, the usual Schrödinger-like time evolution results. However, when the wavefunction develops spatially well-separated lobes, as would happen during a macroscopic measurement, the Bohmian particle can remain trapped in one lobe, and the wavefunction eventually localizes there. The end result, in macroscopic systems, is a wavefunction collapse that is consistent with Born's rule. We illustrate the theory with a simple double-slit experiment simulation.</p>

            <h2>Non-Abelian Gauge Effect for 2-D Non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson Model in Cylinder Type</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiming Zhao, Yazhuang Miao, Yihang Xing, Tianhui Qiu, Hongyang Ma, Xiaolong Zhao</p>
            <p>Non-Abelian gauge offers a powerful route to engineer novel topological phenomena. Here, we systematically investigate a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson model incorporating SU(2) non-Abelian gauge, demonstrating the emergence of Hopf-link bulk braiding topology in the complex energy spectrum solely with x-direction nearest-neighbor couplings. Because of the limitations of exceptional point (EP) topology in fully capturing the rich non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under non-Abelian influence, we introduce a novel polarization parameter derived from the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). This parameter quantitatively discerns left-, right-, and notably, bipolar skin modes, with its accuracy corroborated by directly encoding real-space eigenstate. Our findings reveal that non-Abelian gauge provides unprecedented influence over NHSE, compared with Abelian gauge and without gauge cases. Furthermore, we uncover unique characteristics of zero-imaginary-energy eigenstates at these topological boundaries, including pronounced degeneracy and bipolar localization which is unaffected by size effects, investigated via dynamical evolution and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR). This work establishes a new paradigm for synthesizing and manipulating non-Hermitian topological phases driven by non-Abelian structures, opening avenues for topological engineering and holding promise for experimental realization in synthetic dimensional platforms.</p>

            <h2>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</p>

            <h2>Tailored ordering enables high-capacity cathode materials</h2>

            <p>Newly designed Li-ion battery cathode materials with high capacity and greater flexibility in chemical composition will be critical for the growing electric vehicles market. Cathode structures with cation disorder were once considered suboptimal, but recent demonstrations have highlighted their potential in Li$_{1+x}$M$_{1-x}$O$_{2}$ chemistries with a wide range of metal combinations M. By relaxing the strict requirements of maintaining ordered Li diffusion pathways, countless multi-metal compositions in LiMO$_2$ may become viable, aiding the quest for high-capacity cobalt-free cathodes. A challenge presented by this freedom in composition space is designing compositions which possess specific, tailored types of both long- and short-range orderings, which can ensure both phase stability and Li diffusion. However, the combinatorial complexity associated with local cation environments impedes the development of general design guidelines for favorable orderings. Here we propose ordering design frameworks from computational ordering descriptors, which in tandem with low-cost heuristics and elemental statistics can be used to simultaneously achieve compositions that possess favorable phase stability as well as configurations amenable to Li diffusion. Utilizing this computational framework, validated through multiple successful synthesis and characterization experiments, we not only demonstrate the design of LiCr$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$O$_2$, showcasing initial charge capacity of 234 mAhg$^{-1}$ and 320 mAhg$^{-1}$ in its 20% Li-excess variant Li$_{1.2}$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.2}$O$_2$, but also present the elemental ordering statistics for 32 elements, informed by one of the most extensive first-principles studies of ordering tendencies known to us.</p>
