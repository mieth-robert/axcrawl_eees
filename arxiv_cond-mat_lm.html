            <h2>Surface transport and barrier effects in metal halide perovskites explored by bias polarity switching</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marian Betusiak, Roman Grill, Eduard Belas, Petr Praus, Mykola Brynza, Mahshid Ahmadi, Jonghee Yang, Artem Musiienko</p>
            <p>Surface transport and barrier effects in metal halide perovskites explored by bias polarity switching. By bias polarity switching we experimentally proved that free and trapped holes accumulate beneath the contact barrier. Further investigation proved that the duration of bias pulse changes surface properties that surprisingly affect only free holes. Temperature dependence of accumulated hole dissipation revealed two activation energies 150meV the height of the barrier and 770meV corresponding to a yet unknown process.</p>

            <h2>Variational wavefunctions for fractional topological insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Glenn Wagner, Titus Neupert</p>
            <p>Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host bands with opposite Chern number for the two spin species and could thus be host for fractional topological insulator states. In multicomponent quantum Hall systems, where the spins have equal Chern number, the resulting topological liquid states can be well modeled by trial wavefunctions such as the Halperin $(lmn)$ wavefunctions. These wavefunctions are exact zero energy states of certain short-range (pseudopotential) Hamiltonians. However, we show that such a construction fails in the case where the Chern numbers of the two spins are opposite, since the electrons with opposite Chern number cannot avoid one another. This underlines the importance of suppressing the short-range interspin Coulomb repulsion in order to realize fractional topological insulators in twisted TMDs. We introduce a trial wavefunction for the opposite Chern number Landau levels for filling factor $\nu=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}$ in terms of pairing of composite fermions and show that it has good overlaps with the exact diagonalization ground state when the short-range Coulomb repulsion is sufficiently softened.</p>

            <h2>Probing the Quantized Berry Phases in 1H-NbSe$_2$ Using Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dumitru Călugăru, Yi Jiang, Haojie Guo, Sandra Sajan, Yongsong Wang, Haoyu Hu, Jiabin Yu, B. Andrei Bernevig, Fernando de Juan, Miguel M. Ugeda</p>
            <p>Topologically trivial insulators are classified into two primary categories: unobstructed and obstructed atomic insulators. While both types can be described by exponentially localized Wannier orbitals, a defining feature of obstructed atomic insulators is that the centers of charge of these orbitals are positioned at empty sites within the unit cell, rather than on atoms. Despite extensive theoretical predictions, the unambiguous and quantitative experimental identification of an obstructed atomic phase has remained elusive. In this work, we present the first direct experimental evidence of such a phase in 1H-NbSe$_2$. We develop a novel method to extract the inter-orbital correlation functions from the local spectral function probed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), leveraging the orbital wave functions obtained from ab initio calculations. Applying this technique to STM images, we determine the inter-orbital correlation functions for the atomic band of 1H-NbSe$_2$ that crosses the Fermi level. Our results show that this band realizes an optimally compact obstructed atomic phase, providing the first unambiguous experimental identification of such a phase. Our approach of deconvolving the STM signal using ab initio orbital wave functions is broadly applicable to other material platforms, offering a powerful tool for exploring other electronic phases.</p>

            <h2>Spectral properties from an efficient analytical representation of the $GW$ self-energy within a multipole approximation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dario A. Leon, Kristian Berland, Claudia Cardoso</p>
            <p>We propose an efficient analytical representation of the frequency-dependent $GW$ self-energy $\Sigma$ via a multipole approximation (MPA-$\Sigma$). The multipole-Padé model for the self-energy is interpolated from a small set of numerical evaluations of $\Sigma$ in the complex frequency plane, similarly to the previously multipole representation developed for the screened Coulomb interaction (MPA-$W$) [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 115157 (2021)]. We show that, likewise MPA-$W$, an appropriate choice of frequency sampling in MPA-$\Sigma$ is critical to guarantee computational efficiency and high accuracy. The combined MPA-$W$ and MPA-$\Sigma$ scheme considerably reduces the cost of full-frequency self-energy calculations, especially for spectral band structures over a wide energy range. Crucially, MPA-$\Sigma$ enables a multipole representation for the interacting Green's function $G$ (MPA-$G$), providing a straightforward evaluation of all the spectral properties, and a more general way to define the renormalization factor $Z$. We validate the MPA-$\Sigma$ and MPA-$G$ approaches for diverse systems: bulk Si, Na and Cu, monolayer MoS$_2$, the NaCl ion-pair and the F$_2$ molecule. Moreover, we introduce toy MPA-$\Sigma$/$G$ models to examine the quasiparticle picture in different regimens of weak and strong correlation. With these models, we expose limitations in defining $Z$ from the local derivative of $\Sigma$.</p>

            <h2>Predicting Fundamental Gaps of Chromium-Based 2D Materials Using GW Methods</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miroslav Kolos, František Karlický</p>
            <p>Precise and accurate predictions of the two-dimensional (2D) material's fundamental gap are crucial for next-generation flexible electronic and photonic devices. We, therefore, evaluated the predictivity of the GW approach in its several variants built on various density functional theory (DFT) inputs. We identified reasons for significant discrepancies between generalized gradient approximation and hybrid DFT results for intricate cases of 2D materials containing chromium and evaluated the diverse behavior of subsequent quasiparticle corrections. We examined the impact of omitted vertex corrections using the more computationally intensive quasiparticle self-consistent QPGW and partially self-consistent QPGW$_0$ methodologies. We observed consistent trends across Cr-based and other 2D materials compared by advanced GW calculations, suggesting that single-shot G$_0$W$_0$@PBE can provide reasonable estimates of fundamental gaps when applied with caution. While this approach shows promise for a variety of 2D materials, including complicated antiferromagnetic chromium-based transition metal carbides (MXenes), further research is required to validate its reliability for strongly correlated systems. In contrast, the G$_0$W$_0$@HSE06 approach may strongly overestimate gaps in some cases.</p>

            <h2>Transparent Correlated Metallic Perovskites with Conducive Chemical Disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saeed S. I. Almishal, Pat Kezer, Yasuyuki Iwabuchi, Jacob T. Sivak, Sai Venkata Gayathri Ayyagari, Saugata Sarker, Matthew Furst, Gerald Bejger, Billy Yang, Simon Gelin, Nasim Alem, Ismaila Dabo, Christina M. Rost, Susan B. Sinnott, Vincent Crespi, Venkatraman Gopalan, Roman Engel-Herbert, John T. Heron, Jon-Paul Maria</p>
            <p>This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics--though unavailable to them--thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Dispersive dark excitons in van der Waals ferromagnet CrI3</h2>

            <p>Spin-flip dark excitons are optical-dipole-forbidden quasiparticles with remarkable potential in optoelectronics, especially when they are realized within cleavable van der Waals materials. Despite this potential, dark excitons have not yet been definitively identified in ferromagnetic van der Waals materials. Here, we report two dark excitons in a model ferromagnetic material CrI3 using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and show that they feature narrower linewidths compared to the bright excitons previously reported in this material. These excitons are shown to have spin-flip character, to disperse as a function of momentum, and to change through the ferromagnetic transition temperature. Given the versatility of van der Waals materials, these excitons hold promise for new types of magneto-optical functionality.</p>

            <h2>Photoemission evidence for multi-orbital hole-doping in superconducting La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 interfaces</h2>

            <p>Bilayer nickelate thin film superconductors discovered under ambient pressure enable vast possibilities for investigating electronic structures of the superconducting state. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of heterointerfaces between 1, 2, and 3 unit-cell epitaxial La2.85Pr0.15Ni2O7 films and SrLaAlO4 substates, through pure-oxygen in situ sample transportation. Evidence obtained using photons with distinct probing depths shows that conduction is localized primarily at the first unit cell near the interface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), together with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), indicates that interfacial Sr diffusion and pronounced oxygen 2p hybridization gradient may collectively account for the interfacial confinement of conduction. Fermi surface maps reveal hole doping compared to non-superconducting ambient-pressure bulk crystals. Measurements of dispersive band structures suggest the contributions from both Ni dx2-y2 and dz2 orbitals at the Fermi level. Density functional theory (DFT) + U calculations capture qualitative features of the ARPES results, consistent with a hole-doped scenario. These findings constrain theoretical models of the superconducting mechanism and suggest pathways for enhancing superconductivity in nickelates under ambient pressure.</p>

            <h2>Detection and control of electronic orbital magnetism by spin waves in honeycomb ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lichuan Zhang, Lu Zhang, Dongwook Go, Chengwang Niu, Wulf Wulfheke, Peng Li, Yuanping Chen, Yuriy Mokrousov, Lizhi Zhang</p>
            <p>Exploring and manipulating the orbital degrees of freedom in solids has become a fascinating research topic in modern magnetism. Here, we demonstrate that spin waves can provide a way to control electronic orbital magnetism by the mechanism of scalar spin chirality, allowing for experimental detection using techniques such as the magneto-optical Kerr effect and scanning transmission electron microscopy. By applying linear spin wave theory, we uncover that electronic magnon-driven orbital magnetization is extremely sensitive to the character of the magnonic excitations. Furthermore, we show that both the induced electronic orbital magnetism and the Nernst transport properties of the orbital angular momentum can be regulated by the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, Kitaev interaction, as well as the direction and magnitude of the external magnetic field. We argue that magnon-mediated electronic orbital magnetism presents an emergent variable which has to be taken into account when considering the physics of coupling magnonic excitiations to phonons and light.</p>

            <h2>Atom-Molecule Superradiance and Entanglement with Cavity-Mediated Three-Body Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun Chen, Yuqi Wang, Jingjun You, Yingqi Liu, Su Yi, Yuangang Deng</p>
            <p>Ultracold atoms coupled to optical cavities offer a powerful platform for studying strongly correlated many-body physics. Here, we propose an experimental scheme for creating biatomic molecules via cavity-enhanced photoassociation from an atomic condensate. This setup realizes long-range three-body interactions mediated by tripartite cavity-atom-molecule coupling. Beyond a critical pump strength, a self-organized square lattice phase for molecular condensate emerges, resulting in hybrid atom-molecule superradiance with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. Distinct from previously observed ultracold bosonic (fermionic) atomic superradiance, our findings demonstrate bosonic enhancement characterized by a cubic scaling of steady-state photon number with total atom number. Additionally, strong photon-matter entanglement is shown to effectively characterize superradiant quantum phase transition. Our findings deepen the understanding of quantum superchemistry and exotic many-body nonequilibrium dynamics in cavity-coupled quantum gases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pietro Massignan, Richard Schmidt, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Ataç İmamoglu, Martin Zwierlein, Jan J. Arlt, Georg M. Bruun</p>
            <p>In this work we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and experimental studies of the properties of polarons formed by mobile impurities strongly interacting with quantum many-body systems. We present a unified perspective on the universal concepts and theoretical techniques used to characterize polarons in two distinct platforms, ultracold atomic gases and atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides, which are linked by many deep parallels. We review polarons in both fermionic and bosonic environments, highlighting their similarities and differences including the intricate interplay between few- and many-body physics. Various kinds of polarons with long-range interactions or in magnetic backgrounds are discussed, and the theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding interactions between polarons is described. We outline how polaron physics, regarded as the low density limit of quantum mixtures, provides fundamental insights regarding the phase diagram of complex condensed matter systems. Furthermore, we describe how polarons may serve as quantum sensors of many-body physics in complex environments. Our work highlights the open problems, identifies new research directions and provides a comprehensive framework for this rapidly evolving research field.</p>

            <h2>Magnetic injection photocurrents in valley polarized states of twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Peñaranda, Héctor Ochoa, Fernando de Juan</p>
            <p>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene displays a complex phase diagram as a function of flat band filling, featuring compressibility cascade transitions and a variety of competing ground states with broken spin, valley and point group symmetries. Recent THz photocurrent spectroscopy experiments have shown a dependence on the filling which is not consistent with the simplest cascade picture of sequential filling of equivalent flat bands. In this work, we show that when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to valley polarization, a magnetic injection photocurrent develops which can be used to distinguish different spin-valley polarization scenarios. Using the topological heavy fermion model we compute both shift and injection currents as a function of filling and argue that current experiments can be used to determine the spontaneous valley polarization.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of enhanced thermopower from emergent local moments in flatbands of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayan Ghosh, Souvik Chakraborty, Ranit Dutta, Adhip Agarwala, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, Sumilan Banerjee, Nandini Trivedi, Subroto Mukerjee, Anindya Das</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBLG) indicate an unusual coexistence of heavy and light electrons, a characteristic of heavy-fermion physics. But a global transport measurement showing clear signatures of strong correlations like local moments (LM) arising from the flatbands is missing. Utilizing thermopower ($V_{Th}$) as a sensitive probe for measuring entropy ($S$), we have extensively studied $V_{Th}$ of MATBLG with filling ($\nu$), temperature ($T$) and magnetic field ($B$), and unveiled the presence of LM through their impact on $S$. While at high $T$, the behavior of $V_{Th}$ and resistance ($R$) are related by the Mott formula, it deviates at lower $T$. Below 120K apart from the Dirac point and full band filling, the resistance exhibits prominent peaks at integer fillings. The $V_{Th}$ however, remains featureless and symmetric across the DP with opposite signs. This disparity implies the dominance of different kinds of carriers in $V_{Th}$ and $R$. The $V_{Th}$ has additional sign changes at $\nu_{cross} \sim \pm 1$. The locations of $\nu_{cross}$ do not change with temperature from $5-60K$. For heavy and light band electrons, it can be shown that the doping profile of the $V_{Th}$, and hence $\nu_{cross}$ is highly sensitive to $T$, and therefore solely the contribution from band electrons does not explain the $V_{Th}$ data. Our data is consistent with the dominant contribution arising from the $S$ of the LMs. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of $B$ on the $V_{Th}$, both $B_{\parallel}$ and $B_{\perp}$ showing 30 and 50$\%$ reduction, respectively, and can be attributed to the partial polarization of the LMs (spin/valley), resulting in decreased $S$. Our $V_{Th}$ results highlight the contribution from LMs arising from flatbands, distinct from the band contributions of heavy and light fermions to the resistivity in MATBLG.</p>

            <h2>Stoner ferromagnetism in low-angle twisted bilayer graphene at three-quarters filling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin J. U. Vidarte, Felipe Pérez Riffo, Eric Suárez Morell, Caio Lewenkopf</p>
            <p>We present a theoretical investigation of the magnetic properties exhibited by twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems with small twist angles, where the appearance of flat minibands strongly enhances electron-electron interaction effects. We show that, at three-quarters filling of the conduction miniband, the Stoner mechanism induces a ferromagnetic polarization in the AA-stacking regions, which aligns with recent experimental observations. Our approach models the electronic properties by a tight-binding Hamiltonian combined with a Hubbard mean-field interaction term. We employ a real-space recursion technique to self-consistently calculate the system's local density of states and use our method to investigate the magnetic properties of small-angle TBG at three-quarters filling. The recursion method's $O({\cal N})$ efficiency makes it possible to address extremely large superlattices through a full real-space approach. We validate our procedure by comparing it with mean-field momentum-space calculations from the literature, which identify a magnetic phase in charge-neutral TBGs.</p>

            <h2>Nucleation transitions in polycontextural networks toward consensus</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Falk, Edwin Eichler, Katja Windt, Marc-Thorsten Hütt</p>
            <p>Recently, we proposed polycontextural networks as a model of evolving systems of interacting beliefs. Here, we present an analysis of the phase transition as well as the scaling properties. The model contains interacting agents that strive for consensus, each with only subjective perception. Depending on a parameter that governs how responsive the agents are to changing their belief systems the model exhibits a phase transition that mediates between an active phase where the agents constantly change their beliefs and a frozen phase, where almost no changes appear. We observe the build-up of convention-aligned clusters only in the intermediate regime of diverging susceptibility. Here, we analyze in detail the behavior of polycontextural networks close to this transition. We provide an analytical estimate of the critical point and show that the scaling properties and the space-time structure of these clusters show self-similar behavior. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of consensus in systems of distributed beliefs but also show that polycontextural networks are models, motivated by social systems, where susceptibility -- the sensitivity to change own beliefs -- drives the growth of consensus clusters.</p>

            <p>We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. When the existence probability of each edge follows a Bernoulli distribution, we rigorously prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models with appropriate parameterization coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results is a broad generalization of the result of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) with appropriate parameterization was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model).</p>

            <h2>Density matrix renormalization group study of quantum-geometry-facilitated pair density wave order</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao-Xin Wang, Wen Huang</p>
            <p>Understanding the formation of novel pair density waves (PDWs) in strongly correlated electronic systems remains challenging. Recent mean-field studies suggest that PDW phases may arise in strong-coupling multiband superconductors by virtue of the quantum geometric properties of paired electrons. However, scrutiny through sophisticated many-body calculations has been lacking. Employing large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain in the strong-coupling regime the phase diagram as a function of doping concentration and a tuning interaction parameter for a simple two-orbital model that incorporates quantum geometric effects. The phase diagram reveals a robust PDW phase spanning a broad range of parameters, characterized by a Luttinger parameter $K_{sc} \sim 0.3$ and the absence of coexisting competing spin or charge density wave orders. The observed pairing field configuration aligns with the phenomenological understanding that quantum geometry can promote PDW formation. Our study provides the most compelling numerical evidence to date for quantum-geometry-facilitated intrinsic PDW order in strongly correlated systems, paving the way for further exploration of novel PDW orders and quantum geometric effects in such systems.</p>

            <h2>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yang Liu, Songtai Lv, Yuchen Meng, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou</p>
            <p>By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>Cryogenic Behavior of High-Permittivity Gate Dielectrics: The Impact of the Atomic Layer Deposition Temperature and the Lithographic Patterning Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Paghi, Sebastiano Battisti, Simone Tortorella, Giorgio De Simoni, Francesco Giazotto</p>
            <p>Dielectrics featuring a high relative permittivity, i.e., high-k dielectrics, have become the standard insulators in gate architectures, enhancing the electrical performance of both room temperature and cryogenic electronics. This study delves into the cryogenic (3 K) performance of high-k dielectrics commonly used as gate insulators. We fabricated Al2O3 and HfO2 layers via Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and we extrapolated relative permittivity (k) and dielectric strength (E_BD) from AC (100 Hz to 100 kHz) and DC measurements on metal-insulator-metal capacitors. Our findings reveal a strong dependence of HfO2 cryogenic performance on the ALD growth temperature, while the latter shows a negligible impact on Al2O3. We estimated a ~9 % and ~14 % reduction of the relative permittivity of HfO2 and Al2O3, respectively, from 300 K to 3 K. Additionally, we designed and fabricated Al2O3/HfO2 bilayers and we checked their properties at cryogenic temperatures. The study also investigates the impact of the patterning method, namely, UV or electron-beam lithography (acceleration voltage of 10, 20, or 30 kV), on the high-k dielectric properties.</p>

            <p>It is well-known that water in both liquid and vapor phases exhibits exceptionally weak absorption of light in the visible range. Recent experiments, however, have demonstrated that at the liquid-air interface, absorption in the visible range is drastically increased. This increased absorption results in a rate of evaporation that exceeds the theoretical thermal limit by between two and five times. Curiously, the evaporation rate peaks at green wavelengths of light, while no corresponding absorptance peak has been observed. Experiments suggest that photons can cleave off clusters of water molecules at the surface, but no clear theoretical model has yet been proposed to explain how this is possible. This paper aims to present such a model and explain this surprising and important phenomenon.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Tangui Aladjidi, Nils A.Krause, Ashton S. Bradley, Quentin Glorieux</p>
            <p>We investigate the formation and dynamics of Jones-Roberts solitons in a smoothly inhomogeneous quantum fluid. To do so, we create a superfluid of light using paraxial, near-resonant laser beam propagating through a hot rubidium vapor. We excite a bounded vortex-antivortex dipole in the superfluid and observe its transition to a rarefaction pulse and back, in agreement with the seminal predictions of Jones and Roberts. Employing an analogy with ray optics, we calculate the trajectory of the interacting vortices, deriving an effective refractive index from the inhomogeneous fluid density. Finally, we examine analytically and experimentally the superfluid velocity correlations, observing a transfer of coherence from incompressible to compressible velocity of the quantum fluid, a direct signature of the dynamical conversion between vortices and rarefaction pulse.</p>

            <h2>SUSY design of smooth quantum rings in graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Correa, Luis Inzunza, Vít Jakubský</p>
            <p>We develop a suitable technique to design zero-energy graphene models with radial electrostatic potentials capable of achieving electrostatic confinement. Using the Gaussian law for electrostatics, we derive the charge density associated with these potentials that correspond to concentric electrostatic rings. The technique is based on a modified supersymmetric transformation that allows to design time-reversal invariant interaction terms and to find the corresponding zero-energy bound states in analytical form. Consequently, solutions with the same probability density but different angular momentum are characterized by circular probability currents flowing in opposite directions. The energies of the systems defined in two Dirac valleys (one-valley) have a fourfold (twofold) degeneracy. As an example of the technique, we construct a ring-decorated Coulomb potential that exhibits zero energy collapse and bound states together.</p>

            <h2>Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Fermi Polarons Driven by Time-dependent Interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fan Yang, Ran Qi</p>
            <p>We systematically studied the dynamics of Fermi polarons driven by time-dependent scattering length using a time-dependent variational method. Starting from the non-interacting initial state, we calculated the evolution behavior of the contact, energy, and quasiparticle residue of this system as the scattering length $a_s(t)$ increases from zero. In the short-time evolution, we obtained analytical results, verifying that when $a_s(t)$ grows as $\sqrt{t}$, the contact $C(t)$ and energy $E(t)$ exhibit the maximum growth rate. Furthermore, we numerically solved the long-time evolution, when $a_s(t)$ is diven with a strength $\beta$ and a power $\alpha$ as $a_s(t) = {\sqrt{2}\beta}/{k_F} {(\epsilon_Ft)}^{\alpha}$. For large driving strength, due to the interference between the polaron states and the non-interacting states, $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ exhibit oscillatory behavior; For small $\beta$, the oscillatory behavior disappears due to the decay of the repulsive polaron into the continuum, and $C(t)$ and $Z(t)$ gradually relax to zero. The energy always saturates over long times for different driving strength. Additionally, our method is applicable to any time-dependent form of the scattering length.</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent advances in digital quantum simulation and the overall prospective of solving correlated many-electron problems using quantum algorithms, we design a gate-based quantum circuit that emulates the dynamics of the Kondo impurity model. We numerically determine the impurity magnetization, entanglement between impurity and fermionic sites and energy as a function of time (i.e.~circuit depth) for various initial states and find universal long-time dynamics. We complement the numerical simulations for moderate system size with an asymptotically exact analytical solution that is effective in the limit of large system sizes and for starting states corresponding to a filled Fermi sea. This work opens up the perspective of studying the dynamics of electronic quantum many-body states on quantum chips of the NISQ era.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hyeongseop Kim, Sang-Jun Choi, H.-S. Sim, Sunghun Park</p>
            <p>Understanding environmental effects in a topological Josephson junction is vital for identifying signatures of Majorana modes. We consider a planar Josephson junction formed on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, which possesses Majorana modes inside the junction and boundary modes outside. We find that tunneling between the inner and outer modes gives rise to effective coupling between the inner Majorana modes, and hence induces energy splitting of their states even in the absence of the direct spatial overlap of their wave functions. The energy splitting is obtained analytically in the weak tunneling limit and is numerically investigated for an arbitrary tunneling strength. We discuss in detail the evolution of the energy splitting with an external perpendicular magnetic field and its effect on the shape of the Fraunhofer pattern.</p>

            <h2>Theory of Band Gap Reduction Due to Conduction Electrons in 2D TMDs: Imaginary Frequency Formalism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jack N. Engdahl, Harley D. Scammell, Dmitry K. Efimkin, Oleg P. Sushkov</p>
            <p>Two Dimensional (2D) Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess a large direct band gap which has been experimentally observed to shrink with increasing charge carrier density (doping). The effect has been the subject of theoretical study in recent years using various approaches and approximations. In this work we develop the theory of bandgap renormalization based on Feynman diagrammatic technique in the imaginary frequency formalism. We consider dynamical screening from conduction band electrons using the random phase approximation (RPA), as well as screening from a metallic gate. While our theory is general for any 2D semiconductor, to be specific we consider MoS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ and compare with available experimental data. In both cases we calculate large band gap renormalization that reaches several hundred meV at relatively low carrier density. This is in good agreement with experimental data.</p>

            <p>Phonon polaritons (PhPs) -- light coupled to lattice vibrations -- in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals are promising candidates for controlling the flow of energy at the nanoscale due to their strong field confinement, anisotropic propagation, and ultra-long lifetime in the picosecond range \cite{ref1,ref2,ref3,ref4,ref5}. However, the lack of tunability in their narrow and material-specific spectral range -- the Reststrahlen Band (RB) -- severely limits their technological implementation. Here, we demonstrate that the intercalation of Na atoms in the vdW semiconductor $\alpha$-V$_2$O$_5$ enables a broad spectral shift of RBs, and that the PhPs excited exhibit ultra-low losses (lifetime of $4 \pm 1$~ps), similar to PhPs in the non-intercalated crystal (lifetime of $6 \pm 1$ ps). We expect our intercalation method to be applicable to other vdW crystals, opening the door for the use of PhPs in broad spectral bands in the mid-infrared domain.</p>

            <p>Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) niobium cavities are critical for modern particle accelerators, as well as for advancing superconducting quantum systems and enabling ultra-sensitive searches for new physics. In this work, we report a systematic observation of an anomalous frequency dip in Nb cavities, which occurs at temperatures just below the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$), indicative of enhanced superconducting properties at $T \ll T_c$. The magnitude of this dip is strongly correlated with the RF surface resistance, impurity distribution near the surface, and $T_\mathrm{c}$. We also present the first demonstration of the coherence peak in the AC conductivity of Nb SRF cavities. By comparing recent theories developed to model this experimental data, we show that the frequency dip feature, larger coherence peak height, and reduction in the temperature-dependent surface resistance with RF current occur at minimal but finite levels of disorder.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of a second law of thermodynamics in isolated quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Florian Meier, Tom Rivlin, Tiago Debarba, Jake Xuereb, Marcus Huber, Maximilian P. E. Lock</p>
            <p>The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. This appears to conflict with the reversible evolution of isolated quantum systems under the Schrödinger equation, which preserves the von Neumann entropy. Nonetheless, one finds that with respect to many observables, expectation values approach a fixed value -- their equilibrium value. This ultimately raises the question: in what sense does the entropy of an isolated quantum system increase over time? For classical systems, one introduces the assumption of a low entropy initial state along with the concept of ignorance about the microscopic details of the physical system, leading to a statistical interpretation of the second law. By considering the observables through which we examine quantum systems, both these assumptions can be incorporated, building upon recent studies of the equilibration on average of observables. While the statistical behavior of observable expectation values is well-established, a quantitative connection to entropy increase has been lacking so far. In deriving novel bounds for the equilibration of observables, and considering the entropy of the system relative to observables, we recover a variant of the second law: the entropy with respect to a given observable tends towards its equilibrium value in the course of the system's unitary evolution. These results also support recent findings which question the necessity of non-integrability for equilibration in quantum systems. We further illustrate our bounds using numerical results from the paradigmatic example of a quantum Ising model on a chain of spins. There, we observe entropy increasing up to equilibrium values, as well as fluctuations which expose the underlying reversible evolution in accordance with the derived bounds.</p>

            <p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred as "forever chemicals," are pervasive environmental pollutants due to their resistance to degradation. Among these, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) poses significant threats to human health, contaminating water sources globally. Here, we have demonstrated the potential of a novel electrochemical sensor based on two-dimensional (2D) aluminium-based multicomponent quasicrystals (2D-Al QC) for the ultrasensitive sub-picomolar level detection of PFOA. The 2D-Al QC-inked electrode was employed here to detect PFOA by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The limit of detection (LoD) achieved is 0.59 +/- 0.05 pM. The sensor was evaluated for selectivity with other interfering compounds, repeatability of cycles, and reproducibility for five similar electrodes with a deviation of 0.8 %. The stability of the sensor has also been analysed after ninety days ,which shows a minimal variation of 15%. Spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations were further utilized to understand the interaction between the 2D-Al QC and PFOA. The results demonstrate that the 2D-Al QC offers a promising platform for the rapid and sensitive detection of PFOA, potentially addressing current environmental monitoring challenges.</p>

In this Perspective, we present an overview of the QAHE; discuss the aspects of topological material growth and characterization; and present a path towards an QAHE resistance standard realized in magnetically doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ systems.

            <h2>Band Structure Modeling of Perovskite Materials with Quantum ESPRESSO for Multijunction Photovoltaic Cell Optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sutharsika Kumar Kalaiselvi</p>
            <p>Increasing photovoltaic conversion efficiency, or PCE, has proven to be a critical factor in the transition to renewable energy. There exist strong interdependencies between the perovskite crystals and multijunction architectures within photovoltaic cell research. In present literature, there is a lack of intersection in investigating crystallographic geometry and compositional engineering with representation of computational modeling systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the rapid discovery of high-efficiency perovskite-based multijunction cells, specifically with silicon as the low band gap absorbing semiconductor material. We model the spatial geometries of potential perovskite candidates for high-efficiency cells using the Schrodinger Material Science Maestro, optimizing the periodic boundary conditions on the unit cell to minimize edge-bound errors. Band structure calculations using density functional theory become effective to approximate the PCE. After careful adjustments to the ibrav lattice parameter and parallelization, Quantum ESPRESSO was optimized for perovskite multijunction band structure calculations. Computational results on the six test-perovskite configurations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed representation and method, with a calculated efficiency of about 46% for one of the modeled perovskites, placing it at the top of high-efficiency perovskite-Si multijunction cells. With this method, the potential exists to bring forth a new generation of photovoltaic cells that are easily manufacturable, highly efficient, and economical.</p>

The tensor networks, particularly Tensor Product States (TPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), effectively represent these systems on two-dimensional lattices. However, the technical complexity of TPS/PEPS-based coding is often too much for researchers to handle. To reduce this problem, we developed TeNeS (Tensor Network Solver). This paper introduces TeNeS-v2, which extends TeNeS with real-time and finite temperature simulations, providing deeper insights into quantum many-body systems.

To foster additional progress in this direction, in this work we experimentally investigate the microscopic mechanism driving polariton-polariton interactions. We measure the dispersion relation of the collective excitations that are thermally generated on top of a coherent fluid of interacting lower-polaritons. By comparing the measurements with the Bogoliubov theory over both the lower and upper polariton branches simultaneously, we find that polariton-polariton interactions stem dominantly from a mechanism of saturation of the exciton oscillator strength.</p>

            <p>Hybrid multiterminal Josephson junctions (JJs) are expected to harbor a novel class of Andreev bound states (ABSs), including topologically nontrivial states in four-terminal devices. In these systems, topological phases emerge when ABSs depend on at least three superconducting phase differences, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) energy spectrum characterized by Weyl nodes at zero energy. Here, we realize a four-terminal JJ in a hybrid Al/InAs heterostructure, where ABSs form a synthetic 3D band structure. We probe the energy spectrum using tunneling spectroscopy and identify spectral features associated with the formation of a tri-Andreev molecule, a bound state whose energy depends on three superconducting phases and, therefore, is able to host topological ABSs. The experimental observations are well described by a numerical model. The calculations predict the appearance of four Weyl nodes at zero energy within a gap smaller than the experimental resolution. These topological states are theoretically predicted to remain stable within an extended region of the parameter space, well accessible by our device. These findings establish an experimental foundation to study high-dimensional synthetic band structures in multiterminal JJs, and to realize topological Andreev bands.</p>

            <p>The electronic structure of pure niobium and the niobium-titanium alloy Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ in the bcc-phase at pressures up to $250$ GPa is investigated, to reveal possible factors conducing toward the robust superconductivity reported for Ti-doped niobium upon a considerable volume reduction. We model the structural disorder using the coherent potential approximation, and the electronic correlations are taken into account using dynamical mean-field theory. At high pressure, a significant change in the topology of the Fermi surface is observed, while electronic correlations weaken with increasing pressure. Thus, the normal state of Nb$_{0.44}$Ti$_{0.56}$ is found to be a Fermi liquid with a well-defined Fermi surface, and well-defined quasiparticles near it. The systematic study of the impact of disorder upon the Fermi surface at such ultra high pressures allows notable insights into the nature of the electronic states near the Fermi level, i.e., within the energy scale relevant for superconducting pairing. Furthermore, our results clearly indicate the necessity of further experimental Fermi surface explorations.</p>

            <p>The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high hydrostatic pressure and, more recently, biaxial compression in epitaxial thin films has ignited significant interest in understanding the interplay between atomic and electronic structure in these compounds. Subtle changes in the nickel-oxygen bonding environment are thought to be key drivers for stabilizing superconductivity, but specific details of which bonds and which modifications are most relevant remains so far unresolved. While direct, atomic-scale structural characterization under hydrostatic pressure is beyond current experimental capabilities, static stabilization of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films provides a platform well-suited to investigation with new picometer-resolution electron microscopy methods. Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to directly measure the atomic-scale structural evolution of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films across a wide range of biaxial strains tuned via substrate. By resolving both the cation and oxygen sublattices, we study strain-dependent evolution of atomic bonds, providing the opportunity to isolate and disentangle the effects of specific structural motifs for stabilizing superconductivity. We identify the lifting of crystalline symmetry through modification of the nickel-oxygen octahedral distortions under compressive strain as a key structural ingredient for superconductivity. Rather than previously supposed $c$-axis compression, our results highlight the importance of in-plane biaxial compression in superconducting thin films, which suggests an alternative -- possibly cuprate-like -- understanding of the electronic structure. Identifying local regions of inhomogeneous oxygen stoichiometry and high internal strain near crystalline defects, we suggest potential pathways for improving the sharpness and temperature of the superconducting transition.</p>

            <p>Rich dielectric properties in atomic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhance light-matter interactions and contribute to a variety of optical phenomena. The direct transfer of TMDs onto photonic crystals facilitates optical field confinement and modifies photon dispersion through the generation of polaritons. However, light-matter interaction is severely limited by this stacking method. This limitation can be significantly improved by constructing a vertical stacking cavity with alternating layers of dielectric material and monolayer MoS$_2$. This multilayer structure is proven to be a compact, versatile, and customizable platform for controlling Fabry-Perot cavity resonance mode. Angle-resolved reflectance further aids in studying resonance mode dispersion. Moreover, the strong light-matter interaction results in multiple perfect absorptions, with the monolayer MoS$_2$ significantly contributing to the absorption in this system, as schematically revealed by the electric field distribution. The multiple perfect absorptions produce an unusual amounts of phase singularities with topological pairs, whose generation, evolution, and annihilation can be controlled by adjusting cavity parameters. Our findings provide a flexible and consistent framework for optimizing light-matter interactions and supporting further studies on wavefront shaping, optical vortices, and topological variants.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuri Fukaya, Kazuki Maeda, Keiji Yada, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu</p>
            <p>We consider Josephson junctions formed by coupling two conventional superconductors via an unconventional magnet and investigate the formation of Andreev bound states, their impact on the Josephson effect, and the emergent superconducting correlations. We focus on unconventional magnets known as $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. We find that the Andreev bound states in $d$-wave altermagnet and $p_y$-wave magnet Josephson junctions strongly depend on the transverse momentum, with a spin splitting and low-energy minima as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$. In contrast, the Andreev bound states for $p_{x}$-wave magnets are insensitive to the transverse momentum. We show that the Andreev bound states can be probed by the local density of states in the middle of the junction, which also reveals that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- and $p$-wave magnet junctions are prone to host zero energy peaks. While the zero-energy peak in $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnet junctions tends to oscillate with the magnetic order, it remains robust in $p$-wave magnet junctions. We also demonstrate that the critical currents in $d$-wave altermagnet Josephson junctions exhibit an oscillatory decay with the increase of the magnetic order, while the oscillations are absent in $p$-wave magnet junctions albeit the currents exhibit a slow decay. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the interplay of the Josephson effect and unconventional magnetic order of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets originates from odd-frequency spin-triplet $s$-wave superconducting correlations that are otherwise absent. Our results can serve as a guide to pursue the new functionality of Josephson junctions based on unconventional magnets.</p>

This implies electronic doorway states which facilitate efficient propagation of electrons from the solid to vacuum, some of which only open for samples with more than 5 layers.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bradraj Pandey, Gaurav Kumar Gupta, Gonzalo Alvarez, Satoshi Okamoto, Elbio Dagotto</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent experimental progress in realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) using quantum dot systems, we investigate the diabatic errors associated with the movement of those MZMs. The movement is achieved by tuning time-dependent gate potentials applied to individual quantum dots, effectively creating a moving potential wall. To probe the optimized movement of MZMs, we calculate the experimentally accessible local density-of-states and time-dependent fidelity using many-body time-dependent numerical methods. Our analysis reveals that an optimal potential wall height is crucial to preserve the well-localized nature of the MZM during its movement. Moreover, for the first time, we analyze diabatic errors in realistic quantum-dot systems, incorporating the effects of repulsive Coulomb interactions and disorder in both hopping and pairing terms. Additionally, we provide a comparative study of diabatic errors arising from the simultaneous versus sequential tuning of multiple gates during the MZMs movement. Finally, we estimate the time scale required for MZM transfer in a six-quantum-dot system, demonstrating that MZM movement is feasible and can be completed well within the qubit's operational lifetime in practical quantum-dot setups.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Ultrafast Thermalization of Photoexcited Carriers in Two-Dimensional Materials Induced by Orbital Coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhuoqun Wen, Haiyu Zhu, Wenhao Liu, Zhi Wang, Wen Xiong, Xingzhan Wei</p>
            <p>Understanding the dynamics of photoexcited carriers is essential for advancing photoelectronic device design. Photon absorption generates electron-hole pairs, and subsequent scatterings can induce ultrafast thermalization within a picosecond, forming a quasi-equilibrium distribution with overheated electrons. The high-energy tail of this distribution enables carriers to overcome energy barriers, thereby enhancing quantum efficiency--a phenomenon known as photo-thermionic emission (PTE). Despite its importance, the onset and mechanisms of PTE remain under debate. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we investigate ultrafast carrier thermalization in two-dimensional materials graphene and PtTe2, and the results reveal distinct differences. In graphene, both electrons and holes thermalize into Fermi-Dirac distributions with good agreement to experiment, while PtTe2 exhibits anomalous high-energy tails for both electrons and holes, deviating significantly from Fermi-Dirac behavior. We attribute this anomaly to differences in orbital coupling between the two materials, from which we derive design principles for identifying optimal PTE candidates and, ultimately, improving photodetector performance.</p>

            <h2>Heat Conduction and Thermal Switching Performance of Surface Plasmon Polaritons in Ag2Se Quantum Dot Composite Polymer Film</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Congliang Huang, Changkang Du, Qiangqiang Huang, Xiaodong Wang</p>
            <p>To stabilize the working temperature of an equipment, a solid-state thermal resistor is usually a requisite, which could adjust its heat conductance continuously according to the temperature. In this work, the thermal conductivity and the thermal switching performances of surface plasmon polaritons in the polymer films filled with Ag2Se quantum dots (QDs) were theoretically analyzed, and a theoretical model was also derived to reveal the dependence of the thermal conductivity on the temperature and the structure of a composite film, which is verified to be effective by numerical calculations. It shows that the thermal conductivity will decrease following ~t-3exp({\zeta}/Td) rule under the thin film limit, here t, d and T are film thickness, diameter of QDs and temperature, respectively, and {\zeta} is a constant. A high thermal conductivity could be only realized at a device with a size lager than millimeter scale, due to the need of avoiding boundary scatterings of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). At the millimeter scale, the thermal conductivity could be reduced by 100 times by increasing temperature from 300 to 400 K, which suggests a very high thermal switching ratio almost in all kinds of solid-state thermal resistor. This study brings new insights in designing thermal resistor and understanding heat conduction in films by adjusting its structures.</p>

            <h2>Chiral supersolid and dissipative time crystal in Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xianghua Su, Xiping Fu, Yang He, Ying Shang, Kaiyuan Ji, Linghua Wen</p>
            <p>Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the key factors that affect the chiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the system. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase with a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman coupling strength, strong contrast with the mirror symmetric supersolid phase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC. Two ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg interaction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg interaction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown that the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, soft-core long-range Rydberg interactions, and contact interactions favors rich ground-state structures including half-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with a central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase, mirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave supersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole magnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two cases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form a miscible phase. Furthermore, the stability and superfluid properties of the two-component BECs with Raman-induced SOC and Rydberg interactions in free space are revealed by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. Finally, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a chiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains dissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic behaviors of the system.</p>

            <p>The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates opens new possibilities for investigating electronic structures in this new class of high-transition temperature ($\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$) superconductors. Here, we construct a realistic multi-orbital Hubbard model for the thin-film system based on structural parameters integrating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements and ab initio calculations. The interaction parameters are calculated with the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). The on-site Coulomb repulsive $\bm{U}$ and electron filling $\bm{n}$ dependencies of the correlated electronic structure are investigated based on density functional theory (DFT) plus cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) methods. The fermi surface topology is substantially changed by $\bm{U}$ around the cRPA value, suggesting the indispensable role of correlation effects. A modified random-phase-approximation (RPA) approach, using $\bm{U=3.5}$ and $\bm{n = 1.3}$, yields a pronounced $\bm{s^{\pm}}$-wave pairing instability, due to the strong spin fluctuations originated from Fermi surface nesting between bands with predominantly $\bm{d_{z^{2}}}$ characters. Our findings may explain the similar onset $\bm{T_\mathrm{C}}$ comparing pressured bulks and strained thin films of the bilayer nickelates.</p>

            <h2>Couplings between Photons and Ensemble of Emitters in a High-$Q$ Cavity at Mesoscopic Excitation Levels</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenjiang Qian, Viviana Villafañe, Pedro Soubelet, Andreas V. Stier, Jonathan J. Finley</p>
            <p>We investigate the coupling between an ensemble of individual emitters and multiple photons in a high-$Q$ cavity at the mesoscopic excitation level. The master equation theory is used to calculate the emission spectrum of the cavity QED system. The increasing excitation level not only pumps the system to the high-energy multi-emitter-photon states, but also introduces the pump-induced dephasing that suppresses the coherent energy exchange (coupling) between photons and emitters. When the emitter lifetime exceeds a threshold, we observe the mesoscopic excitation level i.e., the system is pumped to high energy states whilst the coherent couplings between these states are not yet suppressed. The mesoscopic excitation enables the couplings between multi-emitter-photon states, and thereby, paves the way to building quantum photonic devices based on multiple photons and nonlinear effects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yiwei Zhang, Alessandro Manacorda, Étienne Fodor</p>
            <p>We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to a landscape that defines three species: particles with finite size, either of type $A$ or of type $B$, and point particles $\varnothing$. We show that the nonequilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.</p>

            <p>Organic diradicals are envisioned as elementary building blocks for designing a new generation of spintronic devices and have been used in constructing prototypical field effect transistors and non-linear optical devices. Open-shell systems, however, are also reactive, thus requiring design strategies to protect their radical character from the environment, especially when they are embedded into solid-state devices. Here, we report the persistence on a metallic surface of the diradical character of a diindeno[b,i]anthracene (DIAn) core protected by bulky end-groups. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on single-molecules detected singlet-triplet excitations that were absent for DIAn species packed in assembled structures. Density functional theory simulations unravel that molecular geometry on the metal substrate can crucially modify the value of the single-triplet gap via the delocalization of the radical sites. The persistence of the diradical character over metallic substrates is a promising finding for integrating radical-based materials in functional devices.</p>

Successful state preparation is demonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern insulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the steady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained via time evolution of the system with moderate sizes. For larger 2D systems, we compare the mean occupation of the single-particle eigenstates for the ground and steady state computed through mean-field kinetic equations.</p>

            <p>A number of geometric and topological properties of samples of crack-template based conductive films are examined to assess the degree to which Voronoi diagrams can successfully model structure and conductivity in such networks. Our analysis suggests that although Poisson--Voronoi diagrams are only partially successful in modeling structural features of real-world crack patterns formed in films undergoing desiccation, such diagrams can nevertheless be useful in situations where topological characteristics are more important than geometric ones. A phenomenological model is proposed that is more accurate at capturing features of the real-world crack patterns.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pieter M. Gunnink, Tim Ludwig, Alexander Shnirman, Rembert A. Duine</p>
            <p>One of the cornerstones of spintronics is the application of a spin-transfer torque to a nanomagnet, driving the magnetization of the nanomagnet into a steady-state precession and realizing a spin-torque oscillator. Such a steady state, sustained by a balance between driving and dissipation, could be a textbook example for a nonequilibrium situation. Nevertheless, most theoretical descriptions of spin-torque oscillators simply assume local equilibrium. Here, based on a simple model, we investigate the relevance of nonequilibrium effects in spin-torque oscillators. We use a nonequilibrium Keldysh description, which allows us to treat the effects of spin relaxation, and find that, in the absence of spin relaxation, persistent precessions of the magnetization are not allowed, if magnetic anisotropies are absent. However, introducing spin relaxation enables persistent precessions, where the strength of the spin relaxation has quantitative and qualitative effects on the magnetization dynamics. In the presence of magnetic anisotropy, we find that persistent precessions are allowed even if spin relaxation is absent, but spin relaxation causes a nonlinear relation between the oscillator power and the applied voltage bias. Finally, we consider an alternative spin relaxation mechanism and study the resulting magnetization precessions, highlighting the importance of understanding the exact nature of the relaxation in nanomagnets.</p>

            <h2>Capillary Pressure-Saturation relation derived from the Pore Morphology Method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Alonso-Marroquin, Martin P. Andersson</p>
            <p>A computationally efficient method to calculate the capillary pressure-saturation relations of immiscible multiphase flow on two-dimensional pore morphologies is presented here. The method is an extension of the Pore Morphology Method that includes wetting angle and trapped mechanism of the displaced fluid, and calculation of material properties by density functional theory. After validating the method with micro-chip fluid injection experiments, the method is used to relate pore morphology to capillary pressure-saturation relation using square-lattice pore morphologies. Because the method uses only morphological binary operations, it is more efficient than well-established high-resolution voxel dynamics methods such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods and Level-set computational fluid dynamics. Apart from pore morphology, only the material parameters related to contact angle (wettability) and interfacial tension are required to connect the pore-saturation relation and pore throat distribution. We investigate the effect on interfacial tension, wettability, sample size, and pore throat distribution on entry pressure and residual saturation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi</p>
            <p>Phase change materials are exploited in several enabling technologies such as storage class memories, neuromorphic devices and memories embedded in microcontrollers. A key functional property for these applications is the fast crystal nucleation and growth in the supercool liquid phase. Over the last decade, atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial insights on the early stage of this process. These simulations are, however, restricted to a few hundred atoms for at most a few ns. More recently, the scope of the DFT simulations have been greatly extended by leveraging on machine learning techniques. In this paper, we show that the exploitation of a recently devised neural network potential for the prototypical phase change compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$, allows simulating the crystallization process in a multimillion atom model at the length and time scales of the real memory devices. The simulations provide a vivid atomistic picture of the subtle interplay between crystal nucleation and crystal growth from the crystal/amorphous rim. Moreover, the simulations have allowed quantifying the distribution of point defects controlling electronic transport, in a very large crystallite grown at the real conditions of the set process of the device.</p>

Furthermore, MnRuAs exhibits intriguing electronic properties, including quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface and the formation of nodal sphere.

            <p>We observe the magnetic quantum oscillation in the heat capacity of the Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$. The frequency of these oscillations $F = 670$ T, aligns with findings from magnetoresistance and torque magnetometry experiments for $\mu_0 H > 35$ T in the Kondo insulating phase. Remarkably, the quantum oscillation amplitudes in the heat capacity are substantial, with $\Delta \tilde{C}/T \approx$ 0.5 $\rm{mJ}$ $\rm{mol^{-1}K^{-2}}$ at 0.8 K, accounting for 13$\%$ of the known linear heat capacity coefficient $\gamma$. Double-peak structures of quantum-oscillation amplitudes due to the distribution function of fermions were identified and used to determine the value of the effective mass from the heat capacity, which agrees well with that from torque magnetometry.

            <p>Since its discovery, graphene has been one of the most prominent 2D materials due to its unique properties and broad range of possible applications. In particular, the half-integer Quantum Hall Effect (HI-QHE) characterized by the quantization of Hall resistivity as a function of applied magnetic field, offers opportunities for advancements in quantum metrology and the understanding of topological quantum states in this 2D material. While the role of disorder in stabilizing quantum Hall plateaus (QHPs) is widely recognized, the precise interplay between the plateaus width, disorder, mobility and carrier density remains less explored. In this work, we investigate the width of the $\nu=6$ QHP in epitaxial graphene Hall bars, focusing on two distinct regions of the device with markedly different electronic mobilities. Depending on the storage conditions, it is possible to modify the carrier density of graphene QHE devices and consequently increase or reduce the mobility. Our experiments reveal mobility variations of up to 200$\%$ from their initial value. In particular, the sample storage time and ambient conditions cause also noticeable changes in the positions and extension of the QHPs. Our results show that the QHP extension for $\nu=6$ differs significantly between the two regions, influenced by both mobility and disorder, rather than solely by carrier density. Transport simulations based on the Landauer-Büttiker formalism with Anderson disorder in a scaled model reveal the critical role of impurities in shaping graphene transport properties defining the extension of the QHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay between mobility, disorder, and quantum transport in graphene systems.</p>

            <p>The cytoskeleton is an active composite of filamentous proteins that dictates diverse mechanical properties and processes in eukaryotic cells by generating forces and autonomously restructuring itself. Enzymatic motors that act on the comprising filaments play key roles in this activity, driving spatiotemporally heterogeneous mechanical responses that are critical to cellular multifunctionality, but also render mechanical characterization challenging. Here, we couple optical tweezers microrheology and fluorescence microscopy with simulations and mathematical modeling to robustly characterize the mechanics of active composites of actin filaments and microtubules restructured by kinesin motors. We discover that composites exhibit a rich ensemble of force response behaviors, elastic, yielding, and stiffening, with their propensity and properties tuned by motor concentration and strain rate. Moreover, intermediate kinesin concentrations elicit emergent mechanical stiffness and resistance while higher and lower concentrations exhibit softer, more viscous dissipation. We further show that composites transition from well-mixed interpenetrating double-networks of actin and microtubules to de-mixed states of microtubule-rich aggregates surrounded by relatively undisturbed actin phases. It is this de-mixing that leads to the emergent mechanical response, offering an alternate route that composites can leverage to achieve enhanced stiffness through coupling of structure and mechanics.</p>

            <p>A remarkable property of flexible self-avoiding elastic surfaces (membranes) is that they remain flat at all temperatures, even in the absence of a bending rigidity or in the presence of active fluctuations. Here, we report numerical results of these surfaces wherein we alter their topology by systematically cleaving internal bonds. While it is known that a random removal of membrane bonds does not disrupt the overall extended shape of the membrane, we find that cleaving an elastic surface with longitudinal parallel cuts leads to its systematic collapse into a number of complex morphologies that can be controlled by altering the number and length of the inserted cuts. For the simpler case of membranes with bending rigidity but in the absence of self-avoidance, we find that the radius of gyration of the surface as a function of number of cuts is represented by a universal master curve when the variables are appropriately rescaled.</p>

            <p>Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.</p>

We further demonstrate how permanent dipoles, dipoles can preferentially arrange energy eigenstates to support excitation transport. Finally, we show how permanent dipoles can enhance the ability of the molecular chain to support excitation transport compared to that of systems that do not possess permanent dipoles across a range of environmental and system configurations.</p>

            <p>Metastructured auxetic patches, characterized by negative Poisson's ratios, offer unique mechanical properties that closely resemble the behavior of human tissues and organs. As a result, these patches have gained significant attention for their potential applications in organ repair and tissue regeneration. This study focuses on neural networks-based computational modeling of auxetic patches with a sinusoidal metastructure fabricated from silk fibroin, a bio-inspired material known for its biocompatibility and strength. The primary objective of this research is to introduce a novel, data-driven framework for patch design. To achieve this, we conducted experimental fabrication and mechanical testing to determine material properties and validate the corresponding finite element models. Finite element simulations were then employed to generate the necessary data, while greedy sampling, an active learning technique, was utilized to reduce the computational cost associated with data labeling. Two neural networks were trained to accurately predict Poisson's ratios and stresses for strains up to 15\%, respectively. Both models achieved $R^2$ scores exceeding 0.995, which indicates highly reliable predictions. Building on this, we developed a neural network-based design model capable of tailoring patch designs to achieve specific mechanical properties. This model demonstrated superior performance when compared to traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, by providing more efficient and precise design solutions. The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in the design of bio-inspired metastructures for medical applications, paving the way for future innovations in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</p>

            <p>A new physics-based model for analytical calculation of Soft Error Rate (SER) in digital memory circuits under the influence of heavy ions in space orbits is proposed. This method is based on parameters that are uniquely determined from the results of ground tests under nor-mal ion incidence. It is shown that preliminary averaging over the total solid angle within the standard inverse cosine model allows one to take into account the effect of isotropic flow, which increases the effective SER. The model includes the ability to estimate the contribution to SER of the low LET spectrum region, which is very important for modern ICs with low Single Event Upset tolerance.</p>

            <h2>A plastic damage model with mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening for low-cycle fatigue in 7020 aluminum</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alireza Daneshyar, Dorina Siebert, Christina Radlbeck, Stefan Kollmannsberger</p>
            <p>The paper at hand presents an in-depth investigation into the fatigue behavior of the high-strength aluminum alloy EN AW-7020 T6 using both experimental and numerical approaches. Two types of specimens are investigated: a dog-bone specimen subjected to cyclic loading in a symmetric strain-controlled regime, and a compact tension specimen subjected to repeated loading and unloading, which leads to damage growth from the notch tip. Experimental data from these tests are used to identify the different phases of fatigue. Subsequently, a plastic-damage model is developed, incorporating J2 plasticity with Chaboche-type mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening. A detailed investigation reveals that the Chaboche model must be blended with a suitable isotropic hardening and combined with a proper damage growth model to accurately describe cyclic fatigue including large plastic strains up to failure. Multiple back-stress components with independent properties are superimposed, and exponential isotropic hardening with saturation effects is introduced to improve alignment with experimental results. For damage, different stress splits are tested, with the deviatoric/volumetric split proving successful in reproducing the desired degradation in peak stress and stiffness. A nonlinear activation function is introduced to ensure smooth transitions between tension and compression. Two damage indices, one for the deviatoric part and one for the volumetric part, are defined, each of which is governed by a distinct trilinear damage growth function. The governing differential equation of the problem is regularized by higher-order gradient terms to address the ill-posedness induced by softening. Finally, the plasticity model is calibrated using finite element simulations of the dog-bone test and subsequently applied to the cyclic loading of the compact tension specimen.</p>

            <h2>Exploring dynamical quantum phase transition from pure states to mixed states through generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaiyuan Cao, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>We investigate dynamic quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in both pure and mixed states within the framework of the generalized SSH model, specifically analyzing the SSH-3 and SSH-4 models, which exhibit different symmetries. We find that the SSH-3 model, characterized by a chiral-like point symmetry rather than true chiral symmetry, supports robust localized edge states associated with its topological properties. Our results show that DQPTs for pure states occur following a quench that crosses the topological transition, even with an open energy band gap. For mixed states, DQPT behavior is consistent at low temperatures, but significant changes are observed at high temperatures, resulting in the emergence of multiple critical times. In contrast, the SSH-4 model, which possesses chiral symmetry, allows for the analysis of two distinct energy spectrum configurations. We conclude that the occurrence of DQPTs for pure states in the SSH-4 model necessitates a quench from an initial state without a band gap while crossing the critical point of the topological transition, whereas DQPTs are absent for mixed states at elevated temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-Induced Second-Order Skin Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wen-Zheng Ling, Zhao-Fan Cai, Tao Liu</p>
            <p>In contrast to the conventional (first-order) non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a $d$-dimensional system with linear size $L$, the $n$th-order (higher-order) NHSE is characterized by skin modes localized at lower-dimensional boundaries of dimension $(d-n)$. The total number of these modes scales linearly with the system size $L$. Significant progress has been made in understanding higher-order NHSE in non-interacting systems. In this work, we demonstrate the many-body interaction induced second-order skin effect in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian bosonic system. Specifically, we construct a non-Hermitian square lattice that incorporates nonreciprocal single-boson hopping, onsite many-body interactions and two-boson pairing hopping. In the absence of interactions, no second-order NHSE is observed. However, with the inclusion of interactions, we identify interaction-induced skin modes for in-gap doublon states (i.e., bound pairs of bosons) localized at the corners of the lattice, while the bulk doublon states remain extended. These corner-localized skin modes arise from the interplay between interaction-induced edge states, localized along one-dimensional boundaries, and the nonreciprocal hopping along these boundaries. Furthermore, the number of corner skin modes scales linearly with the system size, confirming the presence of second-order NHSE in this interacting system. Our findings introduce a novel approach to realizing higher-order skin effects by leveraging interactions.</p>

            <h2>Black-box optimization and quantum annealing for filtering out mislabeled training instances</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Otsuka, Kento Kodama, Keisuke Morita, Masayuki Ohzeki</p>
            <p>This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luo-Luo Jiang, Yi-Ming Li, Wen-Jing Li, Attila Szolnoki</p>
            <p>The lack of cooperation can easily result in inequality among members of a society, which provides an increasing gap between individual incomes. To tackle this issue, we introduce an incentive mechanism based on individual strategies and incomes, wherein a portion of the income from defectors is allocated to reward low-income cooperators, aiming to enhance cooperation by improving the equitable distribution of wealth across the entire population. Moreover, previous research has typically employed network structures or game mechanisms characterized by homogeneity. In this study, we present a network framework that more accurately reflects real-world conditions, where agents are engaged in multiple games, including prisoner's dilemma games in the top-layer and public good games in the down-layer networks. Within this framework, we introduce the concept of ``external coupling'' which connects agents across different networks as acquaintances, thereby facilitating access to shared datasets. Our results indicate that the combined positive effects of external coupling and incentive mechanism lead to optimal cooperation rates and lower Gini coefficients, demonstrating a negative correlation between cooperation and inequality. From a micro-level perspective, this phenomenon primarily arises from the regular network, whereas suboptimal outcomes are observed within the scale-free network. These observations help to give a deeper insight into the interplay between cooperation and wealth disparity in evolutionary games in large populations.</p>

            <h2>Revealing Point Group Symmetry of Rare-earth Dopants via Polarization-resolved Single-particle Microspectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Peng Li, Yaxin Guo, Yaoxu Yan, Fu Liu, Yanpeng Zhang, Feng Yun, Rongqian Wu, Yi Lyu, Feng Li</p>
            <p>The local point group symmetry of luminescent centers, such as defects, impurities, and dopant ions within a crystal, dictates their optical transition properties. While conventional low-temperature spectroscopy quantifies point group symmetry by enumerating the splitting of optical transitions, it fails to capture vectorial symmetry information, such as the orientation of symmetry axes. Here, we establish a quantitative link between point group symmetry, crystal symmetry, optical transition dipole orientation, and polarized luminescence in rare-earth-doped single-particle crystals using computational electromagnetism. Combined with room-temperature single-particle polarization spectroscopy, we resolve the magnetic dipole orientations from individual optical transition of dopant ions in single microcrystal, enabling precise identification of point group symmetry and its axes. We observe single-particle chirality arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking of intrinsically chiral space group during crystallization. Based on point group and crystal symmetries, we present a practical scheme to optical sensing the 3D orientation of rare-earth-doped single particles in dynamic environments by using two arbitrarily transition bands from single-view polarization spectra. Our computational electromagnetism framework not only elucidates polarized luminescence but also provides insights into optimizing dipole orientation-dependent energy transfer for designing ultra-bright rare-earth-doped nanocrystals, such as Förster resonance energy transfer, and can interpret enhanced linear polarization in extreme optical phenomena like stimulated emission, superradiance, and superfluorescence following dipole-coherent radiation in single emitters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi You, Yan Sun, Feng Wang, Jun Cheng, Fujie Tang</p>
            <p>Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</p>

            <h2>Momentum coupling of classical atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Suto</p>
            <p>A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</p>

For a dissipative spin-boson model with a structured spectral density expressed as a sum of Lorentzian peaks, we demonstrate that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by a neural network to classify the spectral density as comprising one, two, or three Lorentzian peaks and accurately predict their central frequency.</p>

            <p>Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</p>

            <p>A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.</p>

            <p>Epitaxial growth of \k{appa}-phase Ga2O3 thin films are investigated on c-plane sapphire, GaN- and AlNon-sapphire, and (100) oriented yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The structural and surface morphological properties are investigated by comprehensive material characterization. Phase pure \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films are successfully grown on GaN-, AlN-on sapphire, and YSZ substrates through a systematical tuning of the growth parameters including the precursor molar flow rates, chamber pressure and growth temperature, whereas the growth on c-sapphire substrates leads to a mixture of \b{eta}- and \k{appa}polymorphs of Ga2O3 under the investigated growth conditions. The influence of the crystalline structure, surface morphology and roughness of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films grown on different substrates are investigated as a function of precursor flow rate. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films reveals abrupt interfaces between the epitaxial film and the sapphire, GaN and YSZ substrates. The growth of single crystal orthorhombic \k{appa}Ga2O3 films is confirmed by analyzing the STEM nano-diffraction pattern. The chemical composition, surface stoichiometry, and the bandgap energies of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 thin films grown on different substrates are studied by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The type-II (staggered) band alignments at three interfaces between \k{appa}-Ga2O3 and c-sapphire, AlN, and YSZ substrates are determined by XPS, with the exception of \k{appa}-Ga2O3/GaN interface, which shows type I (straddling) band alignment.</p>

The interface and film qualities of Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics are evaluated by high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging, which indicate the growth of high quality amorphous Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics with abrupt interfaces on (010), (100) and (-201) oriented $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The surface stoichiometries of Al$_2$O$_3$ deposited on all orientations of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are found to be well maintained with a bandgap energy of 6.91 eV as evaluated by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which is consistent with the atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics. The evolution of band offsets at both in-situ MOCVD and ex-situ ALD deposited Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are determined as a function of Al composition, indicating the influence of the deposition method, orientation, and Al composition of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films on resulting band alignments. Type II band alignments are determined at the MOCVD grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ interfaces for (010) and (100) orientations, whereas type I band alignments with relatively lower conduction band offsets are observed along (-201) orientation. Results from this work revealed that the in-situ MOCVD deposited high quality Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics with sharp interfaces can be considered as a viable alternative of commonly used ex-situ deposited (ALD) Al$_2$O$_3$ for developing high performance $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ based devices.</p>

            <p>Electronic charge transfer at the atomic scale can reveal fundamental information about chemical bonding, but is far more challenging to directly image than the atomic structure. The charge density is dominated by the atomic nuclei, with bonding causing only a small perturbation. Thus detecting any change due to bonding requires a higher level of sensitivity than imaging structure and the overall charge density. Here we achieve the sensitivity required to detect charge transfer in both pristine and defected monolayer WS\textsubscript{2} using the high dose efficiency of electron ptychography and its ability to correct for lens aberrations. Excellent agreement is achieved with first-principles image simulations including where thermal diffuse scattering is explicitly modeled via finite-temperature molecular dynamics based on density functional theory. The focused-probe ptychography configuration we use also provides the important ability to concurrently collect the annular dark-field signal, which can be unambiguously interpreted in terms of the atomic structure and chemical identity of the atoms, independently of the charge transfer. Our results demonstrate both the power of ptychographic reconstructions and the importance of quantitatively accurate simulations to aid their interpretation.</p>

By systematically tuning the precursor molar flow rates, the epitaxial growth of coherently strained \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films are demonstrated with up to 25% Al compositions as evaluated by high resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD). The asymmetrical reciprocal space mapping confirms the growth of coherent \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films (x < 25%) on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates. While the films show smooth surface morphologies, the alloy inhomogeneity with local segregation of Al along (-201) plane is observed from atomic resolution STEM imaging, resulting in wavy and inhomogeneous interfaces in \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 superlattice structure. Room temperature Raman spectra of \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films show similar characteristics peaks as (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate without obvious Raman shifts for films with different Al compositions. Atom probe tomography (APT) was used to investigate the atomic level structural chemistry with increasing Al content in the \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films. A monotonous increase in chemical heterogeneity is observed from the in-plane Al/Ga distributions which was further confirmed via statistical frequency distribution analysis (FDA).

            <p>The transport properties of matter have been widely investigated. In particular, shear viscosity over a wide parameter space is crucial for various applications, such as designing inertial confinement fusion (ICF) targets and determining the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In this work, an extended random-walk shielding-potential viscosity model (ext-RWSP-VM) based on the statistics of random-walk ions and the Debye shielding effect is proposed to elevate the temperature limit of RWSP-VM [Phys. Rev. E 106, 014142] in evaluating the shear viscosity of one component plasma. In the extended model, we reconsider the collision distance that is introduced by hard-sphere concept, hence, it is applicable in wide temperature regime rather than a narrower one in which RWSP-VM is applicable. The results of H, C, Al, Fe, Ge, W, and U show that the extended model provides a systematic way to calculate the shear viscosity of arbitrary one component plasma at the densities from about 0.1 to 10 times the normal density (the density at room temperature and 1 standard atmosphere). This work will help to develop viscosity model in wide regime when combined with our previous low temperature viscosity model [AIP Adv. 11, 015043].</p>

In this paper, we propose a setup to realize the unidirectional superconductivity as a nonequilibrium steady state. We focus on the in-plane transport of atomically thin bilayer superconductors lacking the in-plane inversion symmetry and introduce dissipation by applying the out-of-plane electric field and current. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that locally stable steady-state solutions appear only under the in-plane supercurrent when the out-of-plane electric field exceeds a threshold value. Our system also realizes the dissipation-induced superconducting diode effect up to 100% efficiency by purely electric means.</p>

            <h2>Uniaxial zero thermal expansion in low-cost Mn2OBO3 from 3.5 to 1250 K</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi-Hung Lee, Cheng-Yen Lin, Guan-Yu Chen</p>
            <p>Unique zero thermal expansion (ZTE) materials are valuable for use in precision instruments, including electronics, aerospace parts, and engines. However, most ZTE materials have a temperature range less than 1000 K under which they do not expand. In this study, we present a uniaxial ZTE in the low-cost Mn2OBO3 with a thermal expansion coefficient of $\alpha$= -4(1)$\times$10^(-7) K-1 along the X1 principal axis from 3.5 to 1250 K. The monoclinic structure of Mn2OBO3 remains stable over the entire temperature range in ambient conditions. Considerable thermal contraction on the BO3 trigonal planar and thermal expansion on the MnO6 octahedra combine to produce uniaxial ZTE. Temperature-dependent Raman scattering reveals anharmonic low-frequency modes associated with MnO6 Rigid Unit Modes (RUMs), which likely play a critical role in driving thermal contraction in the BO3 trigonal planar. No charge order-disorder transition, which could cause thermal contraction, was observed up to 1250 K.</p>

            <p>We show that topological flat minibands can be engineered in a class of narrow gap semiconductor films using only an external electrostatic superlattice potential. We demonstrate that, for realistic material parameters, these bands are capable of hosting correlated topological phases such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states and composite Fermi liquid phases at zero magnetic field. Our results provide a path towards the realization of fractionalized topological states in a broad range of materials.</p>

            <h2>Fluctuating hydrodynamics of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing: static and dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Dinelli, Jérémy O'Byrne, Julien Tailleur</p>
            <p>In this article we derive and test the fluctuating hydrodynamic description of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing, both for mono-disperse systems and for mixtures of co-existing species of active particles. We compute the average steady-state density profile in the presence of spatial motility regulation, as well as the structure factor and intermediate scattering function for interacting systems. By comparing our predictions to microscopic numerical simulations, we show that our fluctuating hydrodynamics correctly predicts the large-scale static and dynamical properties of the system. We also discuss how the theory breaks down when structures emerge at scales smaller or comparable to the persistence length of the particles. When the density field is the unique hydrodynamic mode of the system, we show that active Brownian particles, run-and-tumble particles and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles, interacting via quorum-sensing or chemotactic interactions, display undistinguishable large-scale properties. This form of universality implies an interesting robustness of the predicted physics but also that large-scale observations of patterns are insufficient to assess their microscopic origins. In particular, our results predict that chemotaxis-induced and motility-induced phase separation should share strong qualitative similarities at the macroscopic scale.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qichen Xu, Zhuanglin Shen, Alexander Edström, I. P. Miranda, Zhiwei Lu, Anders Bergman, Danny Thonig, Wanjian Yin, Olle Eriksson, Anna Delin</p>
            <p>Despite extensive research on magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions, a significant challenge remains in crafting nontrivial high-order skyrmionic textures with varying, or even tailor-made, topologies. We address this challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionic metamaterials within a monolayer thin film and suggest several skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly stable, i.e., long-lived, due to a self-stabilization mechanism. This makes these new textures promising for applications. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput atomistic-spin-dynamic simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions (Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0). These entities serve as foundational 'skyrmionic building blocks' to form the here reported intricate textures. In this work, two key contributions are introduced to the field of skyrmionic systems. First, we present a a novel combination of atomistic spin dynamics simulations and controlled assembly protocols for the stabilization and investigation of new topological magnets. Second, using the aforementioned methods we report on the discovery of skyrmionic metamaterials.</p>

            <p>Prions are misfolded proteins that transmit their structural arrangement to neighboring proteins. In biological systems, prion dynamics can produce a variety of complex functional outcomes. Yet, an understanding of prionic causes has been hampered by the fact that few computational models exist that allow for experimental design, hypothesis testing, and control. Here, we identify essential prionic properties and present a biologically inspired model of prions using simple mechanical structures capable of undergoing complex conformational change. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by designing a prototypical mechanical prion and validating its properties experimentally. Our work provides a design framework for harnessing and manipulating prionic properties in natural and artificial systems.</p>

            <h2>Residual entropy from temperature incremental Monte Carlo method</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zenan Dai, Xiao Yan Xu</p>
            <p>Residual entropy, reflecting the degrees of freedom in a system at absolute zero temperature, is important for understanding quantum and classical ground states. Despite its key role in explaining low-temperature phenomena and ground state degeneracy, accurately measuring residual entropy remains a difficult task due to computational challenges. In this Letter, we introduce the Temperature Incremental Monte Carlo (TIMC) method, our new approach to solve these challenges. The TIMC method incrementally calculates the partition function ratio of neighboring temperatures within Monte Carlo simulations, enabling precise entropy calculations and revealing many other temperature-dependent properties in a single computational sweep of temperatures. We have thoroughly tested TIMC on several complex systems, such as the frustrated antiferromagnetic Ising model on both C60 and 2D triangular lattices, the Newman-Moore glassy model, and a 2D quantum transverse field Ising model. Notably, our method overcomes the difficulties encountered in partition function measurements when mapping $d$-dimensional quantum models to $d+1$-dimensional classical counterparts. These difficulties arise from the singular interactions that emerge in the small $\Delta_\tau$ limit during the quantum-to-classical mapping procedure. The TIMC method enables precise entropy calculations across the entire temperature range, as demonstrated in our studies of frustrated spin models, glassy phases, and phases exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method's capability in calculating residual entropy could provide new insights when applied to systems lacking analytical solutions.</p>

            <p>Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the generation of room temperature single-photon emission from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 0.4 Mcts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Athanasios Koliogiorgos, Richard Korytár</p>
            <p>We present an efficient method of calculating the vibrational spectrum of a magnetic molecule adsorbed on a superconductor, directly related to the first derivative of the tunneling $IV$ curve. The work is motivated by a recent scanning-tunneling spectroscopy of lead phthalocyanine on superconducting Pb(100), showing a wealth of vibrational excitations, the number of which highly exceeds molecular vibrations typically encountered on normal metals. We design a minimal model which represents the inelastic transitions by the spectral function of a frontier orbital of the molecule in isolation. The model allows for an exact solution; otherwise the full correlated superconducting problem would be hard to treat. The model parameters are supplied from an ab-initio calculation, where the presence of the surface on the deformation of molecular geometry can be taken into account. The spectral function of the highest-occupied molecular orbital of the anionic PbPc$^{1-}$ shows the best agreement with the experimental reference among other molecular charge states and orbitals. The method allows to include multiple vibrational transitions straightforwardly.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuelin Shao, Xi Dai</p>
            <p>We investigate the electrical transport properties of the mini-valley polarized state proposed recently in slightly doped Bernal Bilayer Graphene (BLG) in large electric displacement fields. By minimizing the Hartree-Fock energy functional, we first confirm the appearance of mini-valley polarized phase. At the low carrier doping regime, the 1-pocket state will be stabilized where only one of the trigonal-wrapping-induced Fermi pockets near the atomic-valley center is filled. Then we study the electrical transport of the 1-pocket state by solving the Boltzmann equation. We find that the valley polarization could be easily flopped by an in-plane electrical field, which will lead to hysteresis loop in the direct current (DC) $I-V$ curves. Such irreversible current responses in the DC limit will directly induce strong nonlinear and nonreciprocal alternating current (AC) responses, which has been already observed in the recent experiments on BLG.</p>

Competing interactions, even when not very strong, are known to destabilize the Kitaev spin liquid.

Here we review the progress in understanding the effects of magnetic fields on some of the perturbed Kitaev systems, particularly on fractionalization and topological order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giulia Pisegna, Suropriya Saha, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>Phenomenological rules that govern the collective behaviour of complex physical systems are powerful tools because they can make concrete predictions about their universality class based on generic considerations, such as symmetries, conservation laws, and dimensionality. While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behaviour of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with non-reciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner-Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory -- which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms -- belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar non-reciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</p>

With this approach, we can visualize models' behaviors and gain a thermodynamic interpretation of information geometric concepts, even in far-from-equilibrium scenarios.

            <h2>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunchao Zhang, Xue-Yang Song, T. Senthil</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dan Crawford, Roland Wiesendanger, Stephan Rachel</p>
            <p>Initializing the ground state of a quantum bit (qubit) based on Majorana zero modes is one of the most pressing issues for future topological quantum computers. We explore a protocol for initializing such topological qubits based on magnet-superconductor hybrid networks by coupling magnetic chains to a single molecule magnet. The parity of the Majorana state is converted to the presence or absence of a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state at the molecule. The coupling can be activated by switching the spin state of the molecule, allowing the ground-state parity of the chain to be controlled. We demonstrate that initialization with either parity for a Majorana qubit can be achieved. We then introduce the augmented Majorana qubit, which includes the state of the molecule in the definition of the logical qubit. Using this definition we can initialize a qubit without high-precision timing.</p>

            <p>We explore the possibility to perform an in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential heating element on a custom in-situ TEM microchip allows to generate a temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices, whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested materials. The results indicate that in-situ thermoelectric TEM studies can help to profoundly understand fundamental aspects of thermoelectricity, which is exemplary demonstrated by tracking the thermovoltage during in-situ crystallization of an amorphous Ge thin film. We propose an improved in-situ TEM microchip design, which should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck coefficient. The benefit of the in-situ approach is the possibility to directly correlate the thermoelectric properties with the structure and chemical composition of the entire studied device down to the atomic level, including grain boundaries, dopants or crystal defects, and to trace its dynamic evolution upon heating or during the application of electrical currents</p>

            <p>Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconducting circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconducting InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</p>

            <p>Nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spectroscopy reveals chemical bonding patterns in materials and molecules through the unique coupling between nuclear spins and local fields. However, traditional NQR techniques require macroscopic ensembles of nuclei to yield a detectable signal, which precludes the study of individual molecules and obscures molecule-to-molecule variations due to local perturbations or deformations. Optically active electronic spin qubits, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, facilitate the detection and control of individual nuclei through their local magnetic couplings. Here, we use NV centers to perform NQR spectroscopy on their associated nitrogen-14 ($^{14}$N) nuclei at room temperature. In mapping the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian, we resolve minute variations between individual nuclei. The measurements further reveal correlations between the parameters in the NV center's electronic spin Hamiltonian and the $^{14}$N quadropolar Hamiltonian, as well as a previously unreported Hamiltonian term that results from symmetry breaking. We further design pulse sequences to initialize, readout, and control the quantum evolution of the $^{14}$N nuclear state using the nuclear quadrupolar Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>The dot product attention mechanism, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, is a cornerstone of modern Transformers. It adeptly captures semantic relationships between word pairs in sentences by computing a similarity overlap between queries and keys. In this work, we explore the suitability of Transformers, focusing on their attention mechanisms, in the specific domain of the parametrization of variational wave functions to approximate ground states of quantum many-body spin Hamiltonians. Specifically, we perform numerical simulations on the two-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, a common benchmark in the field of quantum many-body systems on lattice. By comparing the performance of standard attention mechanisms with a simplified version that excludes queries and keys, relying solely on positions, we achieve competitive results while reducing computational cost and parameter usage. Furthermore, through the analysis of the attention maps generated by standard attention mechanisms, we show that the attention weights become effectively input-independent at the end of the optimization. We support the numerical results with analytical calculations, providing physical insights of why queries and keys should be, in principle, omitted from the attention mechanism when studying large systems.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of a gas of ultracold atoms that are trapped in an array of harmonic potentials and that interacts with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) that acts as a reservoir of Bogoliubov excitations. The ground and excited energy levels of these trapped ultracold atoms are coupled to each other via detuned Raman lasers with corresponding Rabi frequencies. Once excited via the Raman lasers, these trapped ultracold atoms then return to their ground energy levels, but not necessarily to their original trap locations, by emitting Bogoliubov excitations into the BEC. This combination of driving via Raman lasers to excited energy levels and dissipation via interaction with the BEC resulting in emission of Bogoliubov excitations into it will result in the trapped ultracold atoms approaching a steady state, whereby the expectation value of the number of trapped ultracold atoms in each harmonic trap of the array will attain a constant value over time. One can then use this system to prepare states that require a definite number of atoms in a particular energy level, such as BECs and atom lasers used for atom interferometry and for tests of the foundations of quantum mechanics.</p>

            <p>We investigate the entanglement properties of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model from the perspective of the Generalized Brillouin Zone (GBZ). The non-Bloch entanglement entropy is defined on a quasi-reciprocal lattice, obtained by performing an ordinary Fourier transformation on the non-Bloch Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that the broken bulk-boundary correspondence is recovered in terms of the non-Bloch entanglement entropy. When the GBZ is circular, we show that the non-Bloch entanglement entropy is well-defined (real and positive-definite) in large parameter regions, except close to the exceptional points (EPs). In the critical region, we found that each Fermi point contributes precisely 1 to the central charge $c$ of the logarithmic scaling. At the EP, the central charge becomes negative due to the presence of the exceptional bound state. For the case of non-circular GBZ, long-range hopping emerges in the quasi-reciprocal lattice, and the von Neumann entropy on the GBZ is no longer real. However, the non-Bloch edge entanglement entropy remains real, which serves as a reliable topological indicator and respects the bulk-boundary correspondence. We compute the topological phase diagram, and reveal the critical behavior along the exceptional phase boundaries.</p>

            <p>Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</p>

The physics of this spatially modulated condensate is related to a spontaneous breaking of both phase and translational symmetries simultaneously, bearing strong similarities with the highly sought supersolid phase in Helium and ultracold atomic gases but with a novel mechanism typical of the driven-dissipative scenario. We then propose clear-cut and unequivocal experimental signatures that would allow to identify supersolidity phenomena in polariton condensates</p>

We explore non-toxic buffer materials, specifically ZnSe, ZnMgO, 3C-SiC, and WS2, as potential replacements for the traditional Cd-based CdS buffer layer. Our analysis includes a thorough evaluation of the electrical and optical performance of these buffer materials in conjunction with CdTe absorbers. We optimize the thickness of both the buffer and absorber layers to achieve the best performance. Additionally, we examine the impact of defect density variations in the buffer materials and their corresponding temperature effects. Among the tested materials, ZnSe and ZnMgO demonstrate the highest potential, achieving power conversion efficiencies of 20.74% and 20.73%, respectively.</p>

            <h2>Dirac fermions in the altermagnet Ce4Sb3</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xue He, Shihao Zhang</p>
            <p>Altermagnetism exhibits zero net magnetization and spin-splitting electronic structure. The interplay between altermagnetism and topological physics becomes an important topic in the condensed matter physics. In this letter, we propose that the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 hosts Dirac fermions through first-principles calculations and tight-binding model analysis. When subjected to external magnetic field, the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 change from altermagnetic state to ferromagnetic state. Accompanied with magnetic order transition, the four-fold degenerate Dirac points are transited into sextuple degenerate points. Especially, spin-orbital coupling effect has little influence about the Dirac fermions. The topological phases in the altermagnetic state may hold the exotic spin-splitter torque and remarkable nonlinear transport effect. Our work paves the way for exploring the interplay between altermagnetism and non-trivial topological phase.</p>

            <h2>Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Adith Sai Aramthottil, Piotr Sierant, Jakub Zakrzewski</p>
            <p>Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity of bipolarons from quadratic electron-phonon interaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongjin Zhang, Anatoly Kuklov, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov</p>
            <p>In systems with linear electron-phonon interaction (EPI), bound states of polarons, or bipolarons, form by gaining energy from the lattice deformation. The quadratic EPI case is fundamentally different: bipolarons form because electrons lose less energy when the total charge density is "compacted". As the coupling constant is increased, the bipolarons first appear as extended (but finite radius) soliton-type states. They subsequently decrease in radius until their size reaches the inter-atomic scale. We present the first numerically exact solution of the bipolaron problem from quadratic EPI in the presence of both on-site Hubbard and long-range Coulomb repulsion, and compute estimates of the largest superconducting transition temperature within the bipolaron mechanism. We find that $T_c/\Omega$ ratios, where $\Omega$ is the optical phonon frequency, can be several times larger than what one may expect from the linear EPI provided the phonon frequency is increased by orders of magnitude on occupied sites. Electron-electron repulsion can be tolerated at the expense of stronger EPI and the most detrimental effect comes from the Coulomb potential because it easily eliminates extended soliton states.</p>

            <h2>Effects of heating strategies and ballistic transport on the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chuang Zhang, Ziyang Xin, Qin Lou, Hong Liang</p>
            <p>Efficiently capturing the three-dimensional spatiotemporal distributions of temperature is of great significance for alleviating hotspot issues in 3D FinFETs. However, most previous thermal simulations mainly focused on the steady-state problem with continuous heating. Few studies are conducted for the transient thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs with non-continuous heating, which is actually closer to the reality. To investigate the effects of heating strategies on the transient micro/nano scale thermal conduction in 3D FinFETs, three heating strategies are considered, including `Continuous', `Intermittent' and `Alternating' heating. A comparison is made between the phonon BTE solutions and the data predicted by the macroscopic diffusion equation, where the effect of boundary scattering on phonon transport is added into the effective thermal conductivity. Numerical results show that it is not easy to accurately capture the heat conduction in 3D FinFETs by the macroscopic diffusion equation, especially near the hotspot areas where ballistic phonon transport dominates and the temperature diffusion is no longer valid. Different heating strategies have great influence on the peak temperature rise and transient thermal dissipation process. Compared to `Intermittent' or `Continuous' heating, the temperature variance of `Alternating' heating is smaller.</p>

            <p>Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions within a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific paradigm. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate gases. Mesoscopic colliders, through shot-noise measurements, have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet, bridging the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of interacting particles increases remains a challenging task at the microscopic level. Here we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of electron droplets containing up to N = 5 electrons, driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor device. Analyzing the partitioning data using high-order multivariate cumulants and finite-size scaling towards the thermodynamic limit reveals distinctive fingerprints of a strongly-correlated Coulomb liquid. These fingerprints agree well with a universal limit where the partitioning of a droplet is predicted by a single collective variable. Our electron-droplet collider provides critical insight into the interplay of confinement and interaction effects in small electron systems and highlights a new way to study engineered states of matter.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive study of the magnetoelastic properties of the Ising pyrochlore oxide Ho$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$, known as spin ice, by means of high-field magnetostriction measurements and numerical calculations. When a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic <111> axis, the longitudinal magnetostriction exhibits a broad maximum in the low-field regime around 30 T, followed by a dramatic lattice contraction due to crystal-field (CF) level crossing at $B_{\rm cf} \sim 65$ T. The transverse magnetostriction exhibits a contrasting behavior, highlighting the anisotropic nature of the CF striction. We identify distinct timescales of spin dynamics and CF-phonon dynamics by applying a magnetic field with different field-sweep rates. Our mean-field calculations, based on a point-charge model, successfully reproduce the overall magnetostriction behavior, revealing the competition between the exchange striction and CF striction. A signature of the CF level crossing is also observed through adiabatic magnetocaloric-effect measurements, consistent with our magnetostriction data.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pontus Laurell, Bradraj Pandey, Gábor B. Halász, Satoshi Okamoto, Gonzalo Alvarez, Elbio Dagotto</p>
            <p>We study the impact of hole-doping on the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice. We investigate the pairing tendencies and correlation functions in the framework of a $t-J-K$ model using density matrix renormalization group calculations on three-leg cylinders. In the case of the pure Kitaev model, which realizes a quantum spin-liquid phase at half-filling, we find that binding of two holes only occurs at low values of the hopping, where the holes are slow. We have theoretically verified that pair formation occurs in the limit of immobile holes, where the pure Kitaev model remains exactly solvable. When we instead fix the hopping at an intermediate, more realistic, value, and vary the Heisenberg and Kitaev interaction strengths, we find pairing tendencies only in the Néel phase. This is in contrast to prior mean-field calculations, highlighting the importance of accounting for the kinetic energy of dopants in generalized Kitaev models. Interestingly, we also find signatures of pair-density wave formation over the studied range of model parameters, namely a periodic modulation of the charge density as well as the spin-spin and pair-pair correlations in real space. Moreover, we present a comparative study of the different correlations as a function of doping. We finally discuss the potential for experimentally observing the studied physics in quantum materials and heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Typicality, entropy and the generalization of statistical mechanics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bernat Corominas-Murtra, Rudolf Hanel, Petr Jizba</p>
            <p>When at equilibrium, large-scale systems obey conventional thermodynamics because they belong to microscopic configurations (or states) that are typical. Crucially, the typical states usually represent only a small fraction of the total number of possible states, and yet the characterization of the set of typical states -- the typical set -- alone is sufficient to describe the macroscopic behavior of a given system. Consequently, the concept of typicality, and the associated Asymptotic Equipartition Property allow for a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom needed for system's statistical description. The mathematical rationale for such a simplification in the description is due to the phenomenon of concentration of measure. The later emerges for equilibrium configurations thanks to very strict constraints on the underlying dynamics, such as weekly interacting and (almost) independent system constituents. The question naturally arises as to whether the concentration of measure and related typicality considerations can be extended and applied to more general complex systems, and if so, what mathematical structure can be expected in the ensuing generalized thermodynamics. In this paper we illustrate the relevance of the concept of typicality in the toy model context of the "thermalized" coin and show how this leads naturally to Shannon entropy. We also show an intriguing connection: The characterization of typical sets in terms of Renyi and Tsallis entropies naturally leads to the free energy and partition function, respectively, and makes their relationship explicit. Finally, we propose potential ways to generalize the concept of typicality to systems where the standard microscopic assumptions do not hold.</p>

            <p>Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.</p>

            <h2>Correlation stabilized anomalous Hall crystal in bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhongqing Guo, Jianpeng Liu</p>
            <p>When the charge density is sufficiently low, interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) would undergo a phase transition from homogeneous Fermi liquid to an electronic crystal state, known as Wigner crystal. Besides conventional 2DEG, various topological fermionic excitations may also be realized in 2D materials. For example, ``high-order" Dirac fermions exhibiting nontrivial Berry phases may approximately characterize the low-energy excitations in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In this work, we develop a beyond-mean-field theoretical framework to study the interacting ground states and single-particle excitations in slightly charge-doped RMG under vertical electric field. We find that transitions from Fermi liquid to trivial Wigner-crystal states would occur at critical carrier density $\sim 10^{10}\,\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ for all $n$-layer RMG (with $n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6$) which are approximately described by $n$-order Dirac-fermion models. Most saliently, using a more realistic modeling of bilayer graphene including trigonal warping effects, we find that an anomalous Hall crystal state with spontaneous quantized anomalous Hall conductivity would emerge when the carrier density is below $\sim 1\times 10^{11}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$, and it becomes the unique ground state over trivial Wigner crystal when the density is further lower. Counter intuitively, such topological anomalous Hall crystal becomes more stable than the trivial Wigner crystal due to the lower correlation energy gained from dynamical charge fluctuations, which is beyond mean-field description. Our work suggests that slightly carrier-doped bilayer graphene is one of the most promising candidates to realize anomalous Hall crystal. Moreover, the method developed in this work can be readily applied to other interacting 2D systems including moiré superlattices.</p>

            <h2>Disorder effects in a model of competing superconducting and charge-density wave orders in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dror Orgad</p>
            <p>There is evidence for competition between superconductivity and short-range charge-density wave order in a number of cuprate compounds and especially in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$. Here, we use a non-linear sigma model of such competition to study the effects of spatially correlated disorder in the chain layers and delta-correlated disorder in the CuO$_2$ layers. The first is relevant to the oxygen ortho structure and the latter may be induced by electron irradiation. We find that reducing the correlation length of the potential on the chain layers decreases the size of the charge-density wave structure factor but has little effect on its temperature dependence, as observed experimentally. At the same time, the charge-density wave correlation length decreases more than is seen in the experiment. The temperature at which the structure factor peaks coincides with $T_c$ and both decrease when disorder is introduced into the CuO$_2$ planes. Strengthening this disorder reduces the magnitude of the structure factor and eventually turns it into a monotonic function of the temperature. This occurs despite an increase in the local magnitude of the charge-density wave order.</p>

While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</p>

            <p>The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current that is generated once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.</p>

            <p>Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors (\Qm{}) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase \Qm{}. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from \SI{45}{\nano\meter} to \SI{295}{\nano\meter}, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below \SI{200}{\nano\meter} thickness exhibit the highest \Qf{}-product, on the order of $10^{12}$\,Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher \Qf{}-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</p>

            <p>Density functional theory is used to study the effect of compressive and tensile biaxial strain on Mn$_{3}$GaN. Mn$_{3}$GaN is a non-collinear antiferromagnetic antiperovskite with a similar structure to that of an ideal cubic oxide perovskite, but with cations at the octahedral sites while the anion, nitrogen, is found at the B site. The present study explores the response of Mn$_{3}$GaN to (001) strain, considering biaxial strain levels ranging from -5% to 5%. It is found that the electron structure is insensitive to tensile strain. The study supports previous results in that a spin-canted antiferromagnetic order emerges due to tensile strain, inducing net magnetization. Compressive strain collapses the non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin structure and induces a ferrimagnetic order at -2% strain. Notably, in contrast with oxide perovskites, Mn$_{3}$GaN does not respond to strain by octahedral tilt, but rather by intraband redistributions of charge between Mn $d$ states. Despite the similar structure to oxide perovskites, the bonds between the B site anion and octahedral site cations in Mn$_{3}$GaN bonds are less rigid, such that strain is instead accommodated by a change in bond length rather than a change in bond angles.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate in-situ manipulation of the critical temperature ($T_S$) and upper critical field ($H_{C2}$) of conventional and unconventional superconductors via ultrasonic excitation. Using an AC susceptibility measurements, we observed a reduction in $T_S$ with increasing amplitude of the applied ultrasonic waves. This reduction exhibits a power law dependence on the excitation voltage, suggesting a non-linear coupling between the ultrasonic waves and the superconducting order parameter. Analogous behavior was observed in cuprate superconductors, hinting at a possible link between the modified superconducting properties and the modulation of the antiferromagnetic network by ultrasonic excitation. Measurements on a paramagnetic material (Gd$_2$O$_3$) with quenched orbital angular momentum (L\,=\,0) revealed no change in magnetization even at extreme ultrasonic excitation amplitudes. This highlights the role of spin-orbit coupling in the observed effects and rules out the possibility of local temperature increases affecting the measurements. To further confirm this, we conducted auxiliary experiments where a Cernox temperature sensor was subjected to ultrasonic excitation, and the resulting temperature difference relative to a reference Cernox was recorded. Simultaneously, the power difference was measured to assess the impact of ultrasonic heating. This analysis revealed that localized heating effects become dominant above an ultrasonic amplitude of 10 V$_{pp}$.</p>

We find that, although the characteristic wavelength of the pattern is determined during swelling, the surface morphology can be significantly influenced by evaporation-induced shrinking. We observe that the elastocapillary length based on swollen mechanical properties gives a threshold thickness for a surface pattern formation, and consequently an important change in morphology.</p>

            <p>Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with crossovers in QLL thickness and properties and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapor pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.</p>

When binding does not modify the membrane properties and the transfer rates among the three states are cyclically symmetric, the membrane exhibits spiral-wave and homogeneous-cycling modes at high and low binding rates, respectively, as in an off-lattice cyclic Potts model. When binding changes the membrane spontaneous curvature, these spatiotemporal dynamics are coupled with microphase separation. When two symmetric membrane surfaces are in thermal equilibrium, the membrane domains form 4.8.8 tiling patterns in addition to stripe and spot patterns. In nonequilibrium conditions, moving biphasic domains and time-irreversible fluctuating patterns appear. The domains move ballistically or diffusively depending on the conditions.</p>

            <p>We introduce the concept of ergodicity and explore its deviation caused by quantum scars in an isolated quantum system, employing a pedagogical approach based on a toy model. Quantum scars, originally identified as traces of classically unstable orbits in certain wavefunctions of chaotic systems, have recently regained interest for their role in non-ergodic dynamics, as they retain memory of their initial states. We elucidate these features of quantum scars within the same framework of this toy model. The integrable part of the model consists of two large spins, with a classical counterpart, which we combine with a random matrix to induce ergodic behavior. Scarred states can be selectively generated from the integrable spin Hamiltonian by protecting them from the ergodic states using a projector method. Deformed projectors mimic the `quantum leakage' of scarred states, enabling tunable mixing with ergodic states and thereby controlling the degree of scarring. In this simple model, we investigate various properties of quantum scarring and shed light on different aspects of many-body quantum scars observed in more complex quantum systems. Notably, the underlying classicality can be revealed through the entanglement spectrum and the dynamics of `out-of-time-ordered correlators'.</p>

            <p>The magnetic ground-state configuration of iron selenide FeSe has been a topic of debate, with experimental evidence suggesting the stripe spin fluctuations as predominant at low temperatures, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations using exchange-correlation (XC) functional of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) have historically predicted the antiferromagnetic (AFM) dimer configuration. In this study, we utilize the $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ functional, a variant of the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, to investigate the magnetic configurations of FeSe. It is found that $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$ predicts a stripe-AFM ground-state configuration with an anti-parallel spin alignment between layers. The energy difference between the parallel and anti-parallel inter-planar spin alignments is approximately 1.7 meV/atom, predicting a significant but previously unreported interlayer spin coupling not yet observed by experiments. The present study underscores the importance of accurate XC functionals, such as $\text{r}^{2}\text{SCAN}$, in predicting the magnetic ground-state configuration of complex materials like FeSe, highlighting its potential to predict magnetic interactions more reliably than traditional GGA functionals by adhering to exact constraints.</p>

            <p>Bandgaps in layered materials are critical for enabling functionalities such as tunable photodetection, efficient energy conversion, and nonlinear optical responses, which are essential for next-generation photonic and quantum devices. Gap engineering could form heterostructures with complementary materials like transition metal dichalcogenides or perovskites for multi-functional devices. Graphite, conventionally regarded as a gapless material, exhibits a bandgap of ~100 meV in nano-scale patterned highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Raman measurements. Our state-of-the-art calculations, incorporating photoemission matrix element effects, predict this bandgap with remarkable accuracy and attribute it to mechanical distortions introduced during patterning. This work bridges theory and experiment, providing the direct evidence of a tunable bandgap in HOPG. Beyond its fundamental significance, this finding opens new possibilities for designing materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling advancements in terahertz devices and optoelectronics.</p>

            <h2>$\mu$SR evidence of a marked exchange interaction effect on the local spin dynamics of Tb-based molecular nanomagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhammad Maikudi Isah, Lorenzo Sorace, Alessandro Lascialfari, Paolo Arosio, Zaher Salman, André Moreira Nogueira, Giordano Poneti, Manuel Mariani, Samuele Sanna</p>
            <p>We report on the spin dynamics of two Terbium-based molecular nanomagnets, Tb-SQ and Tb-Trp, investigated by means of longitudinal muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements as a function of applied field, flanked by AC susceptibility characterization. In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has an isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is coordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is coordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange interaction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both the samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ peak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic fields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a BPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first, dominating for $T\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\tau_c =\tau_0 \exp(\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second and third ones, dominating respectively for $8<T<15$ K and $T<8$ K, follow a power-law-like behavior $\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\alpha}$ with two different values of $c_0$ and $\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a strongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an exchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions constants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from the one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of $\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach, Raman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin dynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\mu$SR in elucidating complex spin dynamics.</p>

            <h2>LPCVD Grown Si-Doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Films with Promising Electron Mobilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saleh Ahmed Khan, Ahmed Ibreljic, Stephen Margiotta, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan</p>
            <p>We systematically investigated the growth of Si-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films using LPCVD system, achieving high electron mobilities of 162 cm$^2$/V.s and 149 cm$^2$/V.s at carrier concentrations of $1.51 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, for homoepitaxial (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates and heteroepitaxial (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on off-axis c-sapphire substrates with 6° miscut, representing the highest mobilities reported for LPCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ materials. Carrier concentrations were precisely tuned by varying SiCl$_4$ flow rates at a growth temperature of 1000°C, resulting in concentrations ranging from $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ to $1.19 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, as confirmed by both Hall and C-V measurements. The films exhibited high crystalline quality, confirmed by high-resolution XRD and Raman spectroscopy, indicating phase purity and structural integrity. Surface morphologies characterized by FESEM and AFM imaging showed a strong correlation between carrier concentrations and surface smoothness, with lower concentrations resulting in reduced RMS roughness. SIMS analysis revealed uniform Si incorporation, with low carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine impurities below detection limits, indicating high purity of the films. A high low-temperature peak mobility exceeding 843 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s was achieved for (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films at 80 K, highlighting the high purity and low compensation of these films. These findings emphasize the potential of LPCVD growth system for producing high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with thickness ranging between ~2.3-11.7 $\mu$m and faster growth rates (~4.7-17 $\mu$m/hr), promising transport properties, controllable doping, and scalability for developing high power vertical devices.</p>

            <p>This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides.

            <h2>Thermodynamic favourability of 1T phase over 1H phase in group III metal monochalcogenide zigzag nanoribbons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emin Aliyev, Arash Mobaraki, Hâldun Sevinçli, Seymur Jahangirov</p>
            <p>Owing to the promising optoelectric and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. Due to the fact that the most stable 2D monolayer polymorph of MXs is the 1H phase, to date, existing studies in the literature have predominantly focused on the NRs formed from 1H phase MXs. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically favorable at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, unlike metallic 1H ZNRs, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican-hat-shaped top valence band without any built-in potential between the edges. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the edge-localized states, the 1T unpassivated ZNRs possess nearly flat top valence bands. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.</p>

            <p>Understanding the interatomic bonding and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for preparing high-performance 2D semiconductor materials. We have calculated the band structure, electronic properties, and bonding characteristics of SnO in 2D materials by using density functional theory (DFT) and combining bond energy and bond charge models. Atomic bonding analysis enables us to deeply and meticulously analyze the interatomic bonding and charge transfer in the layered structure of SnO. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the local bonding state on the surface of 2D structural materials. In addition, we use the renormalization method to operate energy to determine the wave function at different quantum resolutions. This is of great significance for describing the size and phase transition of nanomaterials.</p>

            <h2>Maximum power Stirling-like heat engine with a harmonically confined Brownian particle</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irene Prieto-Rodríguez, Antonio Prados, Carlos A. Plata</p>
            <p>Heat engines transform thermal energy into useful work, operating in a cyclic manner. For centuries, they have played a key role in industrial and technological development. Historically, only gases and liquids have been used as working substances, but the technical advances achieved over the past decades allow for expanding the experimental possibilities and designing engines operating with a single particle. In this case, the system of interest cannot be addressed at a macroscopic level and their study is framed in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In the present work, we study mesoscopic heat engines built with a Brownian particle submitted to harmonic confinement and immersed in a fluid acting as a thermal bath. We design a Stirling-like heat engine, composed of two isothermal and two isochoric branches, by controlling both the stiffness of the harmonic trap and the temperature of the bath. Specifically, we focus on the irreversible, non quasi-static, case -- whose finite duration enables the engine to deliver a non-zero output power. This is a crucial aspect, which enables the optimisation of the thermodynamic cycle by maximising the delivered power -- thereby addressing a key goal at the practical level. The optimal driving protocols are obtained by using both variational calculus and optimal control theory tools. Also, we numerically explore the dependence of the maximum output power and the corresponding efficiency on the system parameters.</p>

            <h2>Quantized Hall conductivity in monolayer 1T^{\prime}-MoS_2</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Mortezaei Nobahari, Mahmood Rezaei Roknabadi</p>
            <p>1T$^{\prime}$ phase of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides has recently attracted attention for its potential in nanoelectronic applications. This study proves the topological behavior of this material using spin texture, Berry curvature, and Hall conductivity using linear response theory. The spin texture in momentum space reveals a helical spin configuration with spin-momentum locking. Berry curvature distributions around the Dirac points highlight the influence of $\alpha$ parameter demonstrating a topological phase transition in 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$. For $\alpha<1$ the spin-resolved Hall conductivity dominates, corresponding to a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, while for $\alpha>1$, valley-resolved Hall conductivity prevails, indicating a transition to a band insulator (BI) phase. Further analysis explores the spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity and Chern numbers across varying values of $\alpha$, $V$, and Fermi energy, uncovering regions of trivial topological phases (TTP) and the role of the edge modes. Finally, the Nernst coefficients (spin, valley, and total) are investigated at room temperature, revealing significant spin and valley-dependent transport properties. The zero total Nernst coefficient across energy ranges suggests strong cancellation between spin and valley contributions, providing insights into the material's potential for thermoelectric applications and spintronic devices</p>

            <p>An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</p>

            <h2>Striped Spin Density Wave in a Graphene/Black Phosphorous Heterostructure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dolev Haddad, H.A. Fertig, Efrat Shimshoni</p>
            <p>A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moiré lattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the phase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.</p>

            <p>By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the isotropic exchange coupling is equally important as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) interaction in determining the magnon Hall effect, and it can transform to the latter under proper gauge transformation. Moreover, the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the magnon Hall effect without the DM interaction. Both features are exemplified in ferromagnetic honeycomb lattices. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moiré lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</p>

            <h2>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Veljko Janković</p>
            <p>Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</p>

            <h2>A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity</h2>

            <p>Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.</p>

            <p>We study the tractability of classically simulating critical phenomena in the quench dynamics of one-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIMs) using highly truncated matrix product states (MPS). We focus on two paradigmatic examples: a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) that occurs in nonintegrable long-range TFIMs, and the infinite-time correlation length of the integrable nearest-neighbor TFIM when quenched to the critical point. For the DQPT, we show that the order parameters can be efficiently simulated with surprisingly heavy truncation of the MPS bond dimension. This can be used to reliably extract critical properties of the phase transition, including critical exponents, even when the full many-body state is not simulated with high fidelity. The long-time correlation length near the critical point is more sensitive to the full many-body state fidelity, and generally requires a large bond dimension MPS. Nonetheless, we find that this can still be efficiently simulated with strongly truncated MPS because it can be extracted from the short-time behavior of the dynamics where entanglement is low. Our results demonstrate that while accurate calculation of the full many-body state (microstate) is typically intractable due to the volume-law growth of entanglement, a precise specification of an exact microstate may not be required when simulating phases of matter of many-body systems (macrostates). We also study the tractability of simulation using truncated MPS based on quantum chaos and equilibration in the models. We find a counterintuitive inverse relationship, whereby local expectation values are most easily approximated for chaotic systems whose exact many-body state is most intractable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nixon Jerez-Lillo, Francisco A. Rodrigues, Paulo H. Ferreira, Pedro L. Ramos</p>
            <p>Scale-free networks play a fundamental role in the study of complex networks and various applied fields due to their ability to model a wide range of real-world systems. A key characteristic of these networks is their degree distribution, which often follows a power-law distribution, where the probability mass function is proportional to $x^{-\alpha}$, with $\alpha$ typically ranging between $2 < \alpha < 3$. In this paper, we introduce Bayesian inference methods to obtain more accurate estimates than those obtained using traditional methods, which often yield biased estimates, and precise credible intervals. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that our approach provides nearly unbiased estimates for the scaling parameter, enhancing the reliability of inferences. We also evaluate new goodness-of-fit tests to improve the effectiveness of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, commonly used for this purpose. Our findings show that the Watson test offers superior power while maintaining a controlled type I error rate, enabling us to better determine whether data adheres to a power-law distribution. Finally, we propose a piecewise extension of this model to provide greater flexibility, evaluating the estimation and its goodness-of-fit features as well. In the complex networks field, this extension allows us to model the full degree distribution, instead of just focusing on the tail, as is commonly done. We demonstrate the utility of these novel methods through applications to two real-world datasets, showcasing their practical relevance and potential to advance the analysis of power-law behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniel Greve, Giorgio Lovato, Tobias Frohoff-Hülsmann, Uwe Thiele</p>
            <p>Employing a two-species Cahn-Hilliard model with nonreciprocal interactions we show that the interplay of nonreciprocity and conservation laws results in the robust coexistence of uniform stationary and oscillatory phases as well as of uniform and crystalline phases. For nonequilibrium models with a spurious gradient dynamics structure such coexistencies between two or more nonequilibrium phases and resulting phase diagrams can nevertheless be predicted by a Maxwell double-tangent construction. This includes phases with sustained regular or irregular out-of-equilibrium dynamics as further corroborated by bifurcation studies and time simulations.</p>

            <h2>Mean field coupled dynamical systems: Bifurcations and phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wael Bahsoun, Carlangelo Liverani</p>
            <p>We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Automation of Quantum Dot Measurement Analysis via Explainable Machine Learning</h2>

            <p>The rapid development of quantum dot (QD) devices for quantum computing has necessitated more efficient and automated methods for device characterization and tuning. This work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying explainable machine learning techniques to the analysis of quantum dot measurements, paving the way for further advances in automated and transparent QD device tuning. Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in the form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent tuning steps. By design, features present in such images capture certain behaviors or states of the measured QD devices. When considered carefully, such features can aid the control and calibration of QD devices. An important example of such images are so-called $\textit{triangle plots}$, which visually represent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device calibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is $\textit{good}$ and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning, they do not provide any insights into how the device should be adjusted in the case of $\textit{bad}$ images. This is because CNNs sacrifice prediction and model intelligibility for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, a recent study introduced an image vectorization approach that relies on the Gabor wavelet transform (Schug $\textit{et al.}$ 2024 $\textit{Proc. XAI4Sci: Explainable Machine Learning for Sciences Workshop (AAAI 2024) (Vancouver, Canada)}$ pp 1-6). Here we propose an alternative vectorization method that involves mathematical modeling of synthetic triangles to mimic the experimental data. Using explainable boosting machines, we show that this new method offers superior explainability of model prediction without sacrificing accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Minimal Autocorrelation in Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations using Exact Fourier Acceleration</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johann Ostmeyer, Pavel Buividovich</p>
            <p>The hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is a ubiquitous method in computational physics with applications ranging from condensed matter to lattice QCD and beyond. However, HMC simulations often suffer from long autocorrelation times, severely reducing their efficiency. In this work two of the main sources of autocorrelations are identified and eliminated. The first source is the sampling of the canonical momenta from a sub-optimal normal distribution, the second is a badly chosen trajectory length. Analytic solutions to both problems are presented and implemented in the exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) method. It completely removes autocorrelations for near-harmonic potentials and consistently yields (close-to-) optimal results for numerical simulations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and the Ising models as well as in lattice gauge theory, in some cases reducing the autocorrelation by multiple orders of magnitude. EFA is advantageous for and easily applicable to any HMC simulation of an action that includes a quadratic part.</p>

            <h2>Exact lattice bosonization of finite N matrix quantum mechanics and c = 1</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gautam Mandal, Ajay Mohan</p>
            <p>We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix, based on an exact operator bosonization introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities are automatically incorporated in this formalism. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic oscillators, or equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, [2]). The bosonic lattice is equipped with a geometry determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c=1 model, where the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning as g_s l_s, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, such a short distance cut-off cannot appear in the conventional dual of c=1 in terms of the 2D string ``tachyon'', where the expected short distance scale is l_s. This indicates our bosonization as a possibly different dual description to the c=1 matrix model appropriate for ``local physics'' like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhaoxuan Ge, Sebastian Calderon, S. Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi</p>
            <p>The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.</p>

            <p>We investigate key quantum characteristics of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer under the influence of an external magnetic field. Specifically, we analyze the distributions of bipartite and tripartite entanglement quantified through the respective negativities, and the $l_1$-norm of coherence with the help of rigorous analytical and numerical methods. Our findings suggest that the heterotrinuclear molecular nanomagnet $[\{\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{L}\}_2\text{Ni}^\text{II}(\text{H}_2\text{O})_2](\text{ClO}_4)_{2} . 3\text{H}_2\text{O}$, which represents an experimental realization of the mixed spin-(1/2,1,1/2) Heisenberg trimer, exhibits a significant bipartite entanglement between $\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ and $\text{Ni}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions along with robust tripartite entanglement among all three constituent $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ magnetic ions. The significant bipartite and tripartite entanglement persists even at relatively high temperatures up to $37\,\text{K}$ and magnetic fields up to $46\,\text{T}$, whereby the coherence is maintained even at elevated temperatures. {It is evidenced that the aforementioned molecular complex with the magnetic core $\text{Cu}^\text{II}\text{Ni}^\text{II}\text{Cu}^\text{II}$ provides an intriguing quantum resource, which exhibits a star-shaped state within the singlet eigenstate at low magnetic fields and W-like state within the triplet eigenstate at moderate magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>In this study, we employed a quantum computer to solve a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for spin defects in diamond (so-called NV centre) and wurtzite-type aluminium nitride, which are anticipated to be qubits. The probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) method, designed for use in a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) era, was employed to calculate the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state, as represented by the effective Hamiltonian. It is difficult to compute the spin singlet state correctly using density functional theory (DFT), which should be described by multiple Slater determinants. To mitigate the effects of quantum errors inherent in current quantum computers, we implemented a $[[ n+2,n,2 ]]$ quantum error detection (QED) code called the Iceberg code. Despite the inevitable destruction of the encoded state resulting from the measurement of the ancilla qubit at each PITE step, we were able to successfully re-encode and recover the logical success state. In the implementation of the PITE, it was observed that the effective Hamiltonian comprises large components of the diagonal part and a relatively small non-diagonal part, which is frequently the case with quantum chemistry calculations. An efficient implementation of Hamiltonian simulations, in which the diagonal components dominate, was developed on a quantum computer based on the second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. This is the first instance of an encoded PITE circuit being executed on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our results demonstrate that QED effectively reduces quantum errors and that we successfully obtained both the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state. Our demonstration clearly manifests that Zr$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, Ti$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, and Hf$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$ defects have a high potential as spin qubits for quantum sensors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hamid Arian Zad, Jozef Strečka, Winfried Plass</p>
            <p>This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex $[\mathrm{Fe}_3\mathrm{Cl}_3(\mathrm{saltag^\mathrm{Br}})(\mathrm{py})_6]\mathrm{ClO}_4$ to be further abbreviated as Fe$_3$. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately 30~K and 70~K, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.</p>

            <p>We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.</p>

            <p>We propose an algorithm, termed the Non-Equilibrium Transport Sampler (NETS), to sample from unnormalized probability distributions. NETS can be viewed as a variant of annealed importance sampling (AIS) based on Jarzynski's equality, in which the stochastic differential equation used to perform the non-equilibrium sampling is augmented with an additional learned drift term that lowers the impact of the unbiasing weights used in AIS. We show that this drift is the minimizer of a variety of objective functions, which can all be estimated in an unbiased fashion without backpropagating through solutions of the stochastic differential equations governing the sampling. We also prove that some these objectives control the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the estimated distribution from its target. NETS is shown to be unbiased and, in addition, has a tunable diffusion coefficient which can be adjusted post-training to maximize the effective sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on standard benchmarks, high-dimensional Gaussian mixture distributions, and a model from statistical lattice field theory, for which it surpasses the performances of related work and existing baselines.</p>

            <h2>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</p>

            <h2>Information Scrambling with Higher-Form Fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karunava Sil, Sourav Maji, Stavros Christodoulou, Abhishek Chowdhury</p>
            <p>The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</p>

            <p>Thermoreflectance techniques, including time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are powerful tools for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, accurately interpreting their signals remains challenging due to intricate interdependencies among experimental variables. This study introduces a systematic framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to decouple these interdependent parameters and enhance the reliability of thermal property extraction. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify key parameter combinations and establish essential dimensionless numbers that govern thermoreflectance signals. The framework is applied to a GaN/Si heterostructure, where the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS is evaluated and compared. The results demonstrate a high degree of consistency across all three techniques. Notably, with the intricate relationships of parameters unraveled, TDTR, FDTR, and SPS demonstrate significant potential to simultaneously and accurately extract five to seven key thermal properties, including thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance of the GaN/Si multilayer system. This framework not only improves the precision of thermoreflectance measurements but also lays a foundation for advanced thermal metrology in research and industrial applications.</p>

The second part of these notes is dedicated to boundaries and defects in CFT and was presented by the author at the main school. As far as boundaries are concerned, emphasis is placed on boundary operators and their state spaces, as well as the boundary state formalism with the Cardy constraint. Topological defects are discussed in analogy, i.e. defect state spaces and the relevant consistency constraint are derived.

            <p>We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</p>

            <p>We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p}, \sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large $p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a `soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their success probability is not vanishingly small.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>In lattices with uncorrelated on-site potential disorder, Anderson localization near the band edges can exhibit anomalously weak localization in the form of Lifshitz tail states. These states correspond to clusters of contiguous sites with nearly identical on-site energies, allowing excitations to extend significantly beyond the characteristic localization length determined by the inverse of Lyapunov exponent. Since Lifshitz tail states are rare events, with an exponentially small density of states, they are typically considered of limited practical importance. In this work, we demonstrate that when Anderson localization is induced by disorder in an imaginary on-site potential, Lifshitz tail states can dominate the system's dynamics and become experimentally observable. This phenomenon is illustrated through the Anderson-Bernoulli model in a non-Hermitian photonic lattice, shedding light on the unique interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in such systems</p>

            <p>Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for harnessing near-term quantum devices to tackle temporal machine learning tasks. Yet identifying the mechanisms that underlie enhanced performance remains challenging, particularly in many-body open systems where nonlinear interactions and dissipation intertwine in complex ways. Here, we investigate a minimal model of a driven-dissipative quantum reservoir described by two coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, an experimentally realizable platform that features controllable coupling, intrinsic nonlinearity, and tunable photon loss. Using Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we examine how different dynamical regimes encode input drive signals in terms of redundancy (information shared by each oscillator) and synergy (information accessible only through their joint observation). Our key results show that, near a critical point marking a dynamical bifurcation, the system transitions from predominantly redundant to synergistic encoding. We further demonstrate that synergy amplifies short-term responsiveness, thereby enhancing immediate memory retention, whereas strong dissipation leads to more redundant encoding that supports long-term memory retention. These findings elucidate how the interplay of instability and dissipation shapes information processing in small quantum systems, providing a fine-grained, information-theoretic perspective for analyzing and designing QRC platforms.</p>

Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) via electrogeneration of charge-transfer (CT) excimers and subsequent energy transfer to fluorescent acceptors. By assuming a double-decker arrangement of the electron donor and acceptor groups, the molecule TpAT-tFFO supports solution-state thermally activated delayed fluorescence from a CT excimer state and efficient energy transfer to the rubrene dye TBRb. Optimized ECLDs based on this material combination achieve an unprecedented luminance of 6,220 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime (LT50) at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2 exceeds 20 minutes, more than 10-fold longer than other ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between the excimer and the emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF. In mixtures with energy gaps > 0.5 eV, electron transfer results in reduced performance and renders the operation strongly dependent on applied voltage and frequency. By contrast, spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with favorable energy level alignment operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. These findings highlight the innovative potential of ECiHF in improving the performance of ECLD, which can be widely applied in future commercial lighting solutions.</p>

            <h2>Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Périce, Shahnaz Farhat, Sören Petrat</p>
            <p>The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose--Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schrödinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</p>

            <p>In this work, we analyze the relevance of excitation parameters on the emission from single-photon emitting defect centers in GaN. We investigate the absorption spectrum of different emitters by photoluminescence excitation technique at 10\,K. We report large spectral jumps (shifts up to 22\,meV) in the emitters' zero-phonon line (ZPL). The likelihood of such jumps is increased by the change in excitation energy. The shifts indicate a large built-in dipole moment of the defects and suggest a possibility to electrically tune their ZPL in a wide range. From the photoluminescence excitation studies, we observe that for majority of the emitters the absorption peaks exist between 2 and 2.55\,eV. The absorption peaks vary from emitter to emitter, and no universal absorption pattern is apparent. Finally, for selected emitters we observe significantly reduced spectral diffusion and instrument-limited linewidth of $138\,\mu eV$ (0.04\,nm).These findings show a new perspective for atomic defect GaN emitters as sources of coherent photons, shine new light on their energy level structure and show the possibility of tuning the ZPL, paving the way to fully harness their potential for applications in quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Kondo impurity in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard bath: Equilibrium and dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Yuan Wei, Tao Shi, J. Ignacio Cirac, Eugene A. Demler</p>
            <p>We investigate theoretically equilibrium and dynamical properties of a Kondo impurity coupled to either 1D or 2D superconductors, modeled by the attractive Fermi-Hubbard model. By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go beyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that dynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space and time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity hybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet phase transition and $\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For dynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the polarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity polarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes damped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC leads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond analysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an abrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the transient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect regime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC orders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC currents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of the SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime II exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores the U(1) symmetry. We argue that our findings for regime IV provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of DC conductance and suppression of the AC Josephson current. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental realization with ultracold atoms.</p>

            <p>Topological matter shows promise for applications in quantum information and transport. In this work, we examined the electronic and vibronic properties of a prototype molecular system adsorbed to the edges, domain walls, and the bulk of a Su-Schrieffer Hegger polyacetylene chain in the trivial, metallic, and topological phases. Our results reveal that suitable molecular observables show signatures of the topological phase transition and imply the topological phase has a significant advantage and robustness over the metallic phase for electron donation into the molecular system. This advantage persists in the presence of defects and suggests applications of topological materials in molecular catalysis and sensing.</p>

            <h2>Tuning Quantum States at Chirality-Reversed Planar Interface in Weyl Semimetals using an Interstitial Layer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eklavya Thareja, Gina Pantano, Ilya Vekhter, Jacob Gayles</p>
            <p>The electronic band structure of Weyl semimetals possesses pairs of linear band crossings, called Weyl nodes, characterized by opposite chirality charges associated with each node. The momentum space position of the nodes can reverse across a planar interface and these host Fermi-arc-like bound states, in addition to scattering states. We show that a magnetic interstitial layer can tune these states in three distinct ways. The electrostatic potential and one of the in-plane magnetic potential components control the shape of the bound state Fermi-arcs. For moderate values of the same in-plane magnetic potential electrons are spin-filtered across the interface, while both the in-plane magnetic components and the electrostatic potential control the transmission of electrons. The ratio of in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic components can be used to turn on or turn off the magnetic potential effects, since the latter does not affect the interface states. The tunability arises from spin-momentum locking and chirality reversal at the interface. Thus, the effects can mix or interchange depending on the specific material but the states will remain tunable.</p>

            <h2>Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuji Matsuda, Takasada Shibauchi, Hae-Young Kee</p>
            <p>Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Band structure evolution from kagome to Lieb under periodic driving field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gulshan Kumar, Shashikant Kumar, Prakash Parida</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the light-induced transition of the kagome quasienergy spectrum to the Lieb like band structure under periodic driving fields. A generalized framework for the renormalized hopping potential is derived, applicable to any two-dimensional lattice with arbitrary field polarizations. By applying this framework to a kagome lattice driven by linearly polarized light in off-resonant condition, we demonstrate the ability to tune the hopping strength along specific bonds to zero. This tuning induces the merging of Dirac points at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, governed by the field parameters. At specific parameter values, this merging facilitates a transition from the kagome quasienergy spectrum to the Lieb band structure with reduced bandwidth. Our results highlight the critical role of controlled electron hopping in driving this electronic transition, offering valuable insights into the manipulation of electronic properties in periodically driven systems.</p>

            <h2>Bogolon mediated light absorption in multi-component BEC with $Z_2$ symmetry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyu Zhu, Meng Sun</p>
            <p>We investigate the light absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the light absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.</p>

            <h2>Self-generated time crystal in hybrid Josephson junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Nashaat, J. Tekić, Yu. M. Shukrinov</p>
            <p>Time crystals represent a non-equilibrium state of matter with broken time-translation symmetry that repeats itself at regular time intervals. Though initially envisioned as a self-generated and self-sustained periodic motion, their realization has usually required the utilization of external periodic inputs or modulations. While at first it looked like, for a time crystal to exist, the initial proposal had to be abandoned, the recent evidence of inherent time crystals is bringing back the idea of self-generated time crystal under the spotlight. In this work, we demonstrate the appearance of a self-generated space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions with the ferromagnet interface without any external influence. The presence of the exchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a ferromagnet with broken structural inversion symmetry modifies the current phase relation and the critical current due to the coupling between the magnetic moment and Josephson phase. This breaks the time translation symmetry leading to the appearance of the time-crystalline order in the spatiotemporal dependence of superconducting current, which evolves with the double of the modulation frequency. Due to its unique origin and properties, this inherent time crystalline order stands out from the commonly known classification of time crystals into discrete and continuous ones. A self-generated time crystal is demonstrated in two types of hybrid Josephson junctions: the superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor on a topological insulator and the superconductor-three layer ferromagnet-superconductor. Further, we also show that a recently developed magnetometry device that visualizes a supercurrent flow in the Josephson junction at the nanoscale can be used as a platform for experimental detection of space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson junctions.</p>

            <p>The quantum dynamics of a compound sample consisting from a semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) system non-linearly coupled with a leaking single-mode micro-resonator is theoretically investigated. The focus is on the resonance condition when the transition frequency of the double quantum dot equals to the doubled resonator frequency, respectively, and the resulting interplay among the involved phonon or photon channels. As a result, the steady-state quantum dynamics of this complex non-linear system exhibits a variety of possible effects that have been demonstrated here. Particularly, we have found the relationship among the electrical current through the double quantum dot and the microwave field inside the resonator that is nonlinearly coupled to it, with a corresponding emphasizing on their critical behaviors. Additionally, the quantum correlations of the photon flux generated into the resonator mode vary from super-Poissonian to Poissonian photon statistics, leading to single-qubit lasing phenomena at microwave frequencies.</p>

            <p>Semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile source of single photons with tunable properties to be used in quantum-cryptographic applications. A crucial figure of merit of the emitted photons is photon number coherence (PNC), which impacts the security of many quantum communication protocols. In the process of single-photon generation, the quantum dot as a solid-state object is subject to an interaction with phonons, which can therefore indirectly affect the PNC. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of PNC in optically excited quantum dots and how it is affected by phonons. In contrast to the expectation that phonons always deteriorate coherence, PNC can be increased in a quantum dot-cavity system due to the electron-phonon interaction.</p>

We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks by using different activities defined by the generalized means. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</p>

            <p>Similarly to gear systems in vehicles, most chemical reaction networks (CRNs) involved in energy transduction have at their disposal multiple transduction pathways, each characterized by distinct efficiencies. We conceptualize these pathways as `chemical gears' and demonstrate their role in refining the second law of thermodynamics. This allows us to determine the optimal efficiency of a CRN, and the gear enabling it, solely based on its topology and operating conditions, defined by the chemical potentials of its input and output species. By suitably tuning reaction kinetics, a CRN can be engineered to self-regulate its gear settings, maintaining optimal efficiency under varying external conditions. We demonstrate this principle in a biological context with a CRN where enzymes function as gear shifters, autonomously adapting the system to achieve near-optimal efficiency across changing environments. Additionally, we examine artificial molecular motors and reveal that their gearing mechanisms are far from optimally regulated.</p>

            <p>How neurons integrate the myriad synaptic inputs scattered across their dendrites is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Multiple neurophysiological experiments have shown that dendritic non-linearities can have a strong influence on synaptic input integration. These non-linearities have motivated mathematical descriptions of single neuron as a two-layer computational units, which have been shown to increase substantially the computational abilities of neurons, compared to linear dendritic integration. However, current analytical studies are restricted to neurons with unconstrained synaptic weights and unplausible dendritic non-linearities. Here, we introduce a two-layer model with sign-constrained synaptic weights and a biologically plausible form of dendritic non-linearity, and investigate its properties using both statistical physics methods and numerical simulations. We find that the dendritic non-linearity enhances both the number of possible learned input-output associations and the learning velocity. We characterize how capacity and learning speed depend on the implemented non-linearity and the levels of dendritic and somatic inhibition. We calculate analytically the distribution of synaptic weights in networks close to maximal capacity, and find that a large fraction of zero-weight ('silent' or 'potential') synapses naturally emerge in neurons with sign-constrained synapses, as a consequence of non-linear dendritic integration. Non-linearly induced sparsity comes with a second central advantage for neuronal information processing, i.e. input and synaptic noise robustness. We test our model on standard real-world benchmark datasets and observe empirically that the non-linearity provides an enhancement in generalization performance, showing that it enables to capture more complex input/output relations.</p>

            <p>In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</p>

Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators.

            <p>Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that are often traced to a complex interplay among different microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulating the dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</p>

            <p>Thermally-driven semi-crystalline polymer networks are capable to achieve both the one-way shape-memory effect and two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions, therefore representing an appealing class of polymers for applications requiring autonomous reversible actuation and shape changes. In these materials, the shape-memory effects are achieved by leveraging the synergistic interaction between one or more crystalline phases and the surrounding amorphous ones that are present within the network itself. The present paper introduces a general framework for the finite strain continuum phenomenological modeling of the thermo-mechanical and shape-memory behavior of multi-phase semi-crystalline polymer networks. Model formulation, including the definition of phase and control variables, kinematic assumptions, and constitutive specifications, is introduced and thoroughly discussed. Theoretical derivations are general and easily adaptable to all cross-linked systems which include two or more crystalline domains or a single crystalline phase with a wide melting range and manifest macroscopically the one-way shape-memory effect and the two-way shape-memory effect under stress and stress-free conditions. Model capabilities are validated against experimental data for copolymer networks with two different crystalline phases characterized by well-separated melting and crystallization transitions. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed model in predicting all the phenomena involved and in furnishing a useful support for future material and application design purposes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shichao Qi, Jun Ge, Chengcheng Ji, Yiwen Ai, Gaoxing Ma, Ziqiao Wang, Zihan Cui, Yi Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</p>

            <p>Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moiré lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}<1 all the way to {\nu}>6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</p>

            <p>The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</p>

            <h2>Catalytic activity of Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yogesh Kumar Yadav, Mohammad Abu Shaz, Thakur Prasad Yadav</p>
            <p>Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for hydrogen storage because of its abundance and beneficial properties, such as high storage capacity and cost-effectiveness under mild conditions. Despite of these benefits, MgH2 unfavorable thermodynamics and kinetics make it difficult to use in real applications. In this work, the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2have been improved using Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy (HEA) based catalysts, which has been synthesized via mechanical alloying. The experimental findings show that the beginning desorption temperature of MgH2significantly lowered from 425°C to 180°C by adding 5 wt. % Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA in MgH2. Moreover, the catalyst shows enhanced kinetics, attaining 7.3 wt. % hydrogen absorption in 3 minutes at 320°C with 15 atm hydrogen pressure, and ~5 wt. % desorption in 6 minutes at 320°C. These results highlight, how much lower its desorption temperature is than those of other well-known catalysts. Over a span of 25 cycles, MgH2 catalyzed by Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA exhibits remarkable cyclic stability with negligible fluctuations (~ 0.05 wt. %).After a thorough characterization of the materials, a workable catalytic mechanism for HEA was proposed in light of the results.</p>

            <h2>Single-Atom Catalysis: An Opportunity For Surface Science</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gareth S. Parkinson</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, extensive research into single-atom catalysts (SACs) has revealed that the catalytic behavior of metal adatoms is highly dependent on how they interact with their support. A strong dependence on the local coordination environment has led to comparisons with metal-organic complexes, and there is growing excitement about the potential to fine-tune SACs by controlling the adsorption geometry. The rise of computational screening to identify the optimal support-metal combinations underscores the need for rigorous benchmarking of theoretical methods, to validate realistic geometries, mechanisms, and the impact of adsorption on stability and catalytic activity. The surface science approach is particularly well-suited for this task because it allows to precisely determine the geometry of the metal atom and interpret its catalytic behavior. Moreover, the effects of temperature and molecular adsorption on the model catalysts stability can be studied in isolation, and conclusions drawn from UHV studies tested in increasingly common near-ambient pressure and electrochemical setups. This perspective highlights recent breakthroughs and specific systems, including metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon nitrides, where insights from surface science experiments can significantly advance understanding in this rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <p>We investigate experimentally and theoretically the behavior of the confined dark exciton in an InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot, under the application of an external magnetic field in Voigt configuration. We show that by varying the magnitude and direction of the external field one can accurately control the dark-exciton fine-structure splitting. In addition, we show that the dark-exciton spin state is approximately polarized along the cubic crystallographic directions [100] or equivalents. By comparing our experimental results with a model for the exchange and Zeeman interactions, we find the conditions for nullifying the fine-structure splitting between the two eigenstates of the dark exciton, thereby stopping its qubit precession.</p>

            <h2>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Guangyao Huang, Xinfang Zhang, Xiaofeng Yi, Jibang Fu, Weichen Wang, Mingtang Deng</p>
            <p>Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</p>

            <p>The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open a new avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle.

We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.</p>

DenseGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project, and QM9, improving the performance of models like GIN, Schnet, and Hamnet on materials datasets. By optimizing atomic embeddings and reducing computational costs, DenseGNN enables deeper architectures and surpasses other GNNs in crystal structure distinction, approaching X-ray diffraction method accuracy.

            <p>Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 4~GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.</p>

The optical transitions between the ground state (Z) and excited state (Y) manifolds of the environmentally shielded 4f states of these Er3+ ions have wavelengths ~1.5 microns and thus have potential applications to quantum communications and quantum memories. These results are in excellent agreement with recent low-temperature measurements, provided the inadequate calculation of the 4f shell screening is adjusted by reducing the radial extent of the 4f wavefunctions by approximately a factor of 2.</p>

            <p>We expand here our description of a newly developed simple and effective ab initio method of calculating crystal field coefficients (CFCs) of rare-earth atoms in insulating hosts, focusing on Er in wide band gap oxide hosts MgO, ZnO, TiO$_2$, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$, which exemplify different local site symmetries. These hybrid functional calculations, which incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree-Fock theory, reproduce the experimentally identified insulating band gaps of these oxides. The negative values of cohesive and formation energies confirm the structural and chemical stability of these oxides, whereas the defect formation energies indicate that Er doped ZnO, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$ are easier to form compared to Er doped MgO and TiO$_2$. Er doped in these oxide hosts exhibits a spin magnetic moment of $\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$ confirming the $3+$ valence state. The CFCs of these hosted Er are determined from charge densities and potentials obtained from non-spin-polarized calculations, involving a 4\textit{f} core approximation. These CFCs are subsequently used to solve an effective Hamiltonian and generate the crystal field splitting of Er 4f. These calculated Er 4f energy levels are in good agreement with available experiments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elia Stocco, Maria Barbara Maccioni, Andrea Floris, Matteo Cococcioni</p>
            <p>Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.</p>

            <h2>Quantum simulations of defects near the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vijaya Begum-Hudde, Yi-Ting Lee, Barbara A. Jones, André Schleife</p>
            <p>Defects in materials are ubiquitous and one of their adverse effects in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is the initiation of corrosion. While this process starts near the surface, the defects involved and their electronic structure need to be elucidated with high accuracy. Since point defects are confined to a small spatial region, defect embedding theory allows the definition of an active space, comprising of the defect electronic states, that is coupled to the environment of the host material. The active space Hamiltonian is of small rank, enabling access to its electronic properties using a high-level or even exact quantum theory. In this paper we use these techniques and first-principles simulations to compute the structural and electronic properties of near-surface vacancies for the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$, and investigate the influence of defects and hydration on the initiation and propagation of corrosion. We report the defect electronic structure for strongly localized ground and excited states of the surface O vacancy and compare results obtained using full configuration interaction and a variational quantum eigensolver on a quantum computer. Error mitigation techniques are explored and shown to reduce the error due to the hardware noise to the point where the quantum result agrees with the exact solution within chemical accuracy.</p>

            <p>Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions are topological spin structures with fully compensated, net-zero magnetization. Compared to their ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion counterparts, their reduced stray field and enhanced electrical response can enable linear, high-throughput current-driven motion. However, their bubble-like character in conventional bilayer AFs limits their stability to fluctuations, leading to deformation and annihilation. Here we present the engineering of a composite AF chiral multilayer, wherein the interplay of AF and FM interlayer couplings generates compensated skyrmions with compact structures. High-resolution magnetic imaging and micromagnetic simulations show that the internal exchange field stabilizes AF skyrmions at zero external field with characteristics comparable to FM counterparts at 100 mT. Quantitative analyses establish their decoupling above the exchange field, yielding independent, spatially segregated textures in constituent chiral layers. This work provides a foundation to develop AF spin-textures with enhanced immunity, compatible with efficient readout and manipulation, with relevance to unconventional computing.</p>

            <p>Pressure is a powerful thermodynamic parameter for tuning the magnetic properties of van der Waals magnets owing to their weak interlayer bonding. However, local magnetometry measurements under high pressure still remain elusive for this important class of emerging materials. Here we introduce a method enabling in situ magnetic imaging of van der Waals magnets under high pressure with sub-micron spatial resolution. Our approach relies on a quantum sensing platform based on boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which can be placed in atomic contact of any type of two-dimensional (2D) material within a van der Waals heterostructure. We first show that the V$_\text{B}^-$ center can be used as a magnetic field sensor up to pressures of a few GPa, a pressure range for which the properties of a wide variety of van der Waals magnets are efficiently altered. We then use V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in a thin hBN layer to perform magnetic imaging of a van der Waals magnet under pressure. As a proof of concept, we study the pressure-dependent magnetization in micrometer-sized flakes of $1T$-CrTe$_2$, whose evolution is explained by a shift of the Curie temperature. Besides providing a new path for studying pressure-induced phase transitions in van der Waals magnets, this work also opens up interesting perspectives for exploring the physics of 2D superconductors under pressure via local measurements of the Meissner effect.</p>

            <h2>The signature of topology in polar and chiral non-magnetic crystal classes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giancarlo Soavi, Jan Wilhelm</p>
            <p>Topology is fundamental to condensed matter physics, underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in its various forms, protected surface states and spin-valley locking. Central to this is the Berry curvature, a measure of the geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions in crystals. Despite its established connections to space inversion and time-reversal symmetries, a comprehensive framework linking the Berry curvature to other crystal symmetries is still missing. Here, we present a theoretical model for the Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature in the proximity of optical resonances for all non-magnetic crystal classes. The Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature is readily derived from the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of the time-invariant point groups. We show that the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix, which define the divergence of the Berry curvature, are non-zero only for the chiral crystal classes, pointing towards a topological origin of circular dichroism. In polar crystals, we uniquely find a non-zero curl of the Berry curvature, suggesting a topological origin of spontaneous polarization via the Maxwell-Berry equations. Our findings thus open new perspectives for the topological interpretation of textbook phenomena at the heart of condensed matter physics.</p>

Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods.

            <p>Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolishing readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.</p>

            <p>Unravelling the mechanism behind bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in amorphous rare earth-transition metal films has proven challenging. This is largely due to the inherent complexity of amorphous structure and the entangled potential origins arising from microstructure and atomic structure factors. Here, we present an approach wherein the magneto-electric effect is harnessed to induce 90° switching of bulk PMA in Tb-Co films to in-plane directions by applying voltages of only -1.2 V. This manipulation is achieved by voltage-driven insertion of hydrogen atoms into interstitial sites between Tb and Co atoms, which serves as a perturbation to local atomic structure. Using angle-dependent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we find that the anisotropy switching originates from the distortion of crystal field around Tb which reorients the alignment of Tb orbital moments. Initially aligned along Tb-Co bonding directions, the easy magnetization axis undergoes reorientation and switches by 90°, as substantiated by ab-initio calculations. Our study not only concludes the atomic origin of Tb-Co atom bonding configuration in shaping bulk PMA, but also establishes the groundwork for electrically programmable ferrimagnetic spintronics, such as controlling domain wall motion and programming artificial spin textures.</p>

            <p>Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Investigation of magnetic ordering with spin reorientation transition and optical properties in DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ nanomaterials</h2>

            <p>This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Magnetotransport in the Paramagnetic State of a Magnetic Kagome Metal EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yun Shu, Xinrun Mi, Yuhao Wei, Sixue Tao, Aifeng Wang, Yisheng Chai, Dashuai Ma, Xiaolong Yang, Mingquan He</p>
            <p>We investigate the electrical transport properties of a magnetic kagome metal EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which undergoes magnetic ordering below $T_\mathrm{c}=10.5$ K. Unlike typical magnets showing anomalous magnetotransport in their ordered states, EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ exhibits unusual magnetotransport behaviors in its paramagnetic phase. Specifically, the magnetoconductivity shows a linear dependence on magnetic field at low fields below $\sim 1$ T, and the Hall conductivity undergoes a sign change below about 2 T. These behaviors resemble those observed in the charge density wave (CDW) phase of kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs). The anomalous magnetotransport in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ has commonly been attributed to the possible emergence of a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral CDW order. However, given the absence of CDW in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and its manifestation exclusively in the paramagnetic state, the anomalous magnetotransport observed in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ is likely associated with multiband transport and/or the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.</p>

            <h2>Violation of Ferromagnetic Ordering of Energy Levels in Spin Rings for the Singlet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Heson, Shannon Starr, Jacob Thornton</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L>4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture. Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.</p>

            <p>The vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons offers numerous possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. The development of twistoptics - the modulation of the optical properties by twisting stacks of vdW materials - enables directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, known as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of directional propagation of polaritons by reporting the visualization of unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). They arise naturally in twisted hyperbolic stacks with very different thicknesses of their constituents, demonstrated for homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Importantly, their ray-like propagation, characterized by large momenta and constant phase, is tunable by both the twist angle and the illumination frequency. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings introduce twisted asymmetric stacks as efficient platforms for nanoscale directional polariton propagation, opening the door for applications in nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</p>

            <p>Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</p>

            <h2>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muneki Yasuda, Ryosuke Maeno, Chako Takahashi</p>
            <p>In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nick Pant, Rob Armitage, Emmanouil Kioupakis</p>
            <p>III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose</p>
            <p>Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as Rényi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</p>

            <p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.</p>

            <p>We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</p>

            <p>Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</p>

Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</p>

            <h2>Enhanced Phonon-Phonon Interactions and Weakened Electron-Phonon Coupling in Charge-Density-Wave Topological Semimetal EuAl4 with a Possible Intermediate Electronic State</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shize Cao, Feng Jin, Yun-Ze Long, Jianlin Luo, Qingming Zhang, Zhi-Guo Chen</p>
            <p>The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue. Furthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW transitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon coupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still under debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering intriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase below temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and temperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two phonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened probably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature range from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the significant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the shoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc around 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state with the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore, below Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g phonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1 atoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode after the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the EPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity in EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI and the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase but also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in EuAl4.</p>

            <p>CeRh2As2 is a newly discovered candidate of multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor (Tc=0.3 K) with intriguing physical properties. Here, we employ soft point-contact spectroscopy to investigate its energy gap behaviors in both the normal and superconducting states. The differential conductance below Tc reveals an estimated superconducting energy gap of 2{\Delta}SC=0.24 meV and thus an extremely strong superconducting pairing strength 2{\Delta}SC/kBTc=8.8, which is comparable to those of cuprates and iron-based high-Tc superconductors as well as infinite-layer nickelates. Above Tc, a well-defined pseudogap feature is manifested as a V-shaped dip in the differential conductance spanning an energy scale of 2{\Delta}g=0.95-3.0 meV. The pseudogap feature persists to the highest characteristic temperature of Tg=8-9 K and is gradually suppressed by magnetic field of Bg=9.0T regardless of its direction relative to the crystallographic axes. The observation of pseudogap features prior to the superconducting phase transition enriches the phase diagram of CeRh2As2 and provides a novel platform to study the interplay of unconventional superconductivity and pseudogap phenomena.</p>

            <p>Despite several theoretical predictions regarding the physics and application of quantum wells (QWs) of topological crystalline insulators (TCI), no quantized charge transport via helical or chiral edge states has been experimentally demonstrated for such a class of systems. In this study, we report here on a successful growth by molecular beam epitaxy of high crystalline quality Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se:Bi/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs with $x = 0.25$ and $y = 0.1$, and on their magnetotransport characterization as a function of the QW thickness between 10 and 50 nm, temperatures down to 300 mK, perpendicular and tilted magnetic fields up to 36 T. The character of weak antilocalization magnetoresistance and universal conductance fluctuations points to a notably long phase coherence length. It is argued that a relatively large magnitude of the dielectric constant of IV-VI compounds suppresses the decoherence by electron-electron scattering. The observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations and the quantum Hall effect, together with multiband $k\cdot p$ modelling, have enabled us to assess valley degeneracies, the magnitude of strain, subbands effective masses, the Berry phases, and the topological phase diagram as a function of the QW thickness. Our results demonstrate that further progress in controlling Sn content, carrier densities, and magnetism in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs will allow for the exploration of the topologically protected quantized edge transport even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, a reduced strength of electron-electron interactions will result in the absence of unpaired localized spins in the topological gap and, thus, in a substantially longer topological protection length compared to the quantum spin Hall materials explored so far.</p>

            <p>Chirality, a pervasive phenomenon in nature, is widely studied across diverse fields including the origins of life, chemical catalysis, drug discovery, and physical optoelectronics. The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects. Recently, significant progress has been made in the fabrication and assembly of low-dimensional micro and nanoscale chiral materials and their architectures, leading to the discovery of novel optoelectronic phenomena such as circularly polarized light emission, spin and charge flip, advocating great potential for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and biosensing. Despite these advancements, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and amplification of chirality in low-dimensional chiral materials and architectures remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we focus on employing ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of chirality evolution, with the aim of attaining a more profound understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing chirality generation and amplification. This review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the chiral micro-/nano-materials, including two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), chiral halide perovskites, and chiral metasurfaces, with a particular emphasis on the physical mechanism.

            <p>The diversity of 2D materials and their van der Waals (vdW) stacking presents a fertile ground for engineering novel multifunctional materials and quantum states of matter. This permits unique opportunities to tailor the electronic properties of vdW heterostructures by the insertion of only a single 2D material layer. However, such vdW materials engineering at the atomic scale has yet to be investigated for spin-charge interconversion phenomena. Here, we report on the control of these effects at the monolayer level, where drastic increase in intensity and change in sign of THz spintronic emission are demonstrated by inserting a single layer of MoSe$_2$ between PtSe$_2$ and graphene in a fully epitaxial, large area stacked structure. By using a combination of spin and angle resolved photoemission and density functional theory to reveal the electronic and spin structures, we illustrate two different mechanisms relying on charge transfer and electronic hybridization for the formation of Rashba states, which are responsible for spin-charge conversion and hence the THz spintronic emission. These findings open new pathways to design, at the atomic scale, efficient THz spintronic emitters made of 2D materials and other spintronic devices based on spin-charge interconversion phenomena.</p>

            <p>In doped transition metal dichalcogenides, optically created excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) can strongly interact with a Fermi sea of electrons to form Fermi polaron quasiparticles. When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shichao Qi, Jun Ge, Chengcheng Ji, Yiwen Ai, Gaoxing Ma, Ziqiao Wang, Zihan Cui, Yi Liu, Ziqiang Wang, Jian Wang</p>
            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Large upper critical fields and strong coupling superconductivity in the medium-entropy alloy (Ti1/3Hf1/3Ta1/3)1-xNbx</h2>

            <p>Since the discovery of high-entropy superconductors in 2014, superconductivity has remained a focal point of interest in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs). Here, we report a series of (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors crystallized in the BCC structure, whose superconductivity was characterized by resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements. The study found that the (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEAs exhibit bulk superconductivity. With the doping of Nb, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increases from 5.31 K to 9.11 K, and the normalized Cel jumps at Tc, and the logarithmically averaged characteristic phonon frequency exhibit dome-shaped curves. Results from specific heat measurements indicate that the superconductivity is of a strongly coupled s-wave type observed. Furthermore, at low Nb content, the upper critical field of the samples is larger than the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The strongly coupling behavior and large upper critical field in s-wave type (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx MEA superconductors are unusual, as they typically occur in other unconventional superconductors. Thus, (Ti0.33Hf0.33Ta0.33)1-xNbx may have significant potential in the research and understanding of physical mechanisms.</p>

            <p>Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in magnetic topological insulators induces a Dirac gap in the topological surface state (TSS), leading to exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Yet, the interplay between TRSB and topology in superconductors remains underexplored due to limited suitable materials. Here we employ zero-field muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) as a sensitive probe of TRSB to map out the electronic phase diagrams of iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. For the Te composition $x=0.64$ with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=14.5$ K, which is known to host a TSS and Majorana zero modes within vortices, we detect spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$ distinct from a magnetic order. This signifies a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk, revealing the convergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with topologically nontrivial electronic structures in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. Given the relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ and the tunability of the Fermi level through chemical substitution, iron-chalcogenide superconductors offer an intriguing platform for investigating the synergy between topological superconductivity and TRSB.</p>

            <p>Misfit-layered compounds, naturally occurring bulk heterostructures, present a compelling alternative to artificially engineered ones, offering a unique platform for exploring correlated phases and quantum phenomena. This study investigates the magnetotransport and superconducting properties of the misfit compound (PbS)$_{1.13}$TaS$_2$, comprising alternating PbS and 1$H$-TaS$_2$ layers. It exhibits distinctive transport properties, including a prominent planar Hall effect and a four-fold oscillatory Butterfly-shaped anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Moreover, it shows multigap two-dimensional superconductivity with an exceptionally high in-plane upper critical field, exceeding the Pauli limit. The coexistence of unconventional superconductivity and anomalous transport - two distinct quantum phenomena, within the same material, suggests that misfit compounds provide an ideal platform for realizing quantum effects in the two-dimensional limit of bulk crystals. This opens the door to the development of simpler and more efficient quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Ensemble-averaged mean-field many-body level density: an indicator of integrable versus chaotic single-particle dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Georg Maier, Carolyn Echter, Juan Diego Urbina, Caio Lewenkopf, Klaus Richter</p>
            <p>According to the quantum chaos paradigm, the nature of a system's classical dynamics, whether integrable or chaotic, is universally reflected in the fluctuations of its quantum spectrum. However, since many-body spectra in the mean field limit are composed of independent single-particle energy levels, their spectral fluctuations always display Poissonian behavior and hence cannot be used to distinguish underlying chaotic from integrable single-particle dynamics. We demonstrate that this distinction can, instead, be revealed from the mean many-body level density (at fixed energy) and its variance after averaging over ensembles representing different types of single-particle dynamics. This is in strong contrast to the energy-averaged mean level density (of a given system) that is assumed not to carry such information and is routinely removed to focus on universal signatures. To support our claim we systematically analyze the role of single-particle level correlations, that enter through Poisson and random matrix statistics (of various symmetry classes) into the ensemble-averaged density of states and its variance, contrasting bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. Our analytical study, together with extensive numerical simulations for systems with $N \ge 5$ particles consistently reveal significant differences (up to an order of magnitude for fermions and even larger for bosons) in the mean many-body level densities, depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics. Notably, in the fermionic case Poisson-type single-particle level fluctuations precisely cancel contributions from indistinguishability, such that the average many-body spectral density equals the (Thomas-Fermi) volume term. We further highlight the difference between the mean level density and its variance as functions of the total energy $E$ and the excitation energy $Q$.</p>

            <p>High-energy bursts in superconducting quantum circuits from various radiation sources have recently become a practical concern due to induced errors and their propagation in the chip. The speed and distance of these disturbances have practical implications. We used a linear array of multiplexed MKIDs on a single silicon chip to measure the propagation velocity of a localized high-energy burst, introduced by driving a Normal metal- Insulator-Superconductor (NIS) junction. We observed a reduction in the apparent propagation velocity with NIS power, which is due to the combined effect of reduced phonon flux with distance and the existence of a minimum detectable QP density in the MKIDs. A simple theoretical model is fitted to extract the longitudinal phonon velocity in the substrate and the conversion efficiency of phonons to QPs in the superconductor.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivalika Sharma, Liviu Chioncel, Igor Di Marco</p>
            <p>Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</p>

            <p>Electrocatalytic processes occurring at the heterogeneous interface are complex and their understanding at the molecular level remains challenging. Atomic force microscope (AFM) can detect force interactions down to the atomic level, but so far it has been mainly used to obtain in-situ images of electrocatalysts. Here for the first time, we employ AFM to investigate gas evolution at a platinum ultramicroelectrode (Pt UME) under electrochemical conditions using the force noise method. We detect excess force noise when the individual H2 gas bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment events occur at the Pt UME. The excess noise varies linearly with the applied potential on a semi-log plot. Chronoamperometry current fluctuations indicate that the H2 gas bubble radius increases from 1 to 10 micrometers and the AFM deflection signal measurements indicate that the mean H2 bubble radius is 321 micrometers. These two values point to the coalescence of small bubbles generated at the Pt UME interface. The contribution reports an innovative method to probe the gas bubble dynamics at the heterogenous interface under electrochemical conditions with high sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Advancement of solid state electrolytes (SSEs) for all solid state batteries typically focuses on modification of a parent structural framework for improved conductivity, \textit{e.g.} cation substitution for an immobile ion or varying the concentration of the mobile ion. Therefore, novel frameworks can be disruptive by enabling fast ion conduction aided by different structure and diffusion mechanisms, and unlocking optimal conductors with different properties (\textit{e.g.} mechanical properties, sintering needs, electrochemical stability) than previously published. Herein, we perform a high throughput survey of an understudied structural framework for sodium ion conduction, Na$_{8-x}$A$^x$P$_2$O$_9$ (NAP), to understand the family's thermodynamic stability, synthesizability, and ionic conduction. We first show that the parent phase Na$_4$TiP$_2$O$_9$ (NTP) undergoes a structural distortion (with accompanying conductivity transition) due to unstable phonons from a pseduo-Jahn Teller mode in the 1D titanium chains. Then, screening of cation-substituted structural candidates with \textit{ab initio} and machine-learned potential calculations reveal a number of candidates that are thermodynamically stable, likely synthesizable, and have high predicted ionic conductivities. High throughput experimental trials and subsequent methodology optimization of one Na$_4$SnP$_2$O$_9$ (NSP) highlight collective challenges to the synthesis pathways for sodium phosphate materials via solid state synthesis. Our results demonstrate that NAP is a highly tunable conduction framework whose high temperature conductivity transition has heretofore eliminated it from significant research interest. By expanding the structural toolkit for SSE design, we increase the number of useful sodium ion electrolytes for integration into safe and accessible solid state batteries.</p>

            <p>The demand for efficient data processing motivates a shift toward in-memory computing architectures. Ferroelectric materials, particularly AlScN, show great promise for next-generation memory devices. However, their widespread application is limited due challenges such as high coercive fields, leakage currents and limited stability. Our work introduces a novel synthesis approach for ferroelectric AlScN thin films using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Through a combinatorial study, we investigate the effect of scandium content and substrate bias on the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films deposited using metal-ion synchronized (MIS) HiPIMS. Leveraging the high ionization rates of HiPIMS and optimally timed substrate bias potentials, we enhance the adatom mobility at low temperatures. Our films exhibit a high degree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as low as 250°C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields comparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced remanent polarization (158-172.0 {\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent polarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further evaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory applications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible technique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the way for their application in non-volatile memory applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ke Li, Jitai Yang, Yu Zhai, Hui Li</p>
            <p>Lithium and sodium solid electrolytes feature polyanion frameworks and highly mobile cations. Understanding and quantifying the impact of polyanion dynamics on cations will help us to unravel the complex role that anion play in superionic conductors. However, no experimental or computational method can directly extract this information, as polyanion dynamics are always coupled with other factors that affect ion mobility. Here, we present the pioneering study that combines constraint algorithm and machine-learning molecular dynamics to quantitatively reveal the effects of polyanion translation, rotation, and vibration on cation mobility across a diverse material class. Ultralong-time, large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations with selective constraints on each anion motion mode unequivocally yield results at near room and elevated temperatures. In sharp contrast to the previous understanding that facile anion rotation primarily facilitates cation transport, the strong coupling between anion translation and vibration with cation diffusion has been unraveled for the first time; we find that translation, rotation, and vibration can each directly drive superionicity, with one typically dominant in each class of materials. Anion rotation dominates cation transport when the rotation frequency matches the cation hopping frequency, whereas anion translation prevails at higher and vibration at lower rotation frequencies. The impact of anion dynamics on cation diffusion becomes more prominent at lower temperatures.</p>

            <p>The long-standing question of why foaming is easier in seawater than in freshwater remains unresolved. In this study, we address this issue through precise interferometry single bubble experiments, demonstrating that the theory proposed by G. Marrucci (1969) provides a compelling explanation. Electrolyte solutions with varying concentrations of phosphate salts were used to study film formation and drainage, with thickness tracked by interferometry. In deionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse. However, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes. While surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration gradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that despite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be observed. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased interfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the film due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni stresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam stability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and the predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our findings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the theory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting its broader relevance.</p>

            <p>Ring polymer self-consistent field theory is used to calculate the critical temperatures and heat capacities of an ideal Bose gas for an order of magnitude more particles than previously reported. A lambda-transition indicative of Bose-Einstein condensation is observed as expected. Using a known proof of spatial mode entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates, a relationship between boson exchange and quantum entanglement is established. This is done without the use of state vectors, since ring polymer quantum theory uses instead a thermal degree of freedom, sometimes called the "imaginary time", to map classical statistical mechanics onto non-relativistic quantum mechanics through the theorems of density functional theory. It is shown that quantum phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensation, boson exchange, entanglement and contextuality, can be visualized in terms of merging and separating ring polymer threads in thermal-space. A possible extension to fermions is mentioned.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Sappington, Vaibhav Mohanty</p>
            <p>Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</p>

However, these emerging new physical effects have rarely been experimentally observed due to the limited choice of suitable materials.

We find extremely rich magnetic topological states in V$_2$WS$_4$, including an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, the axion state with the long-sought quantized topological magnetoelectric effect, three-dimensional QAH state, as well as a collection of QAH insulators and intrinsic axion insulators in odd- and even-layer films, respectively. Remarkably, the Néel temperature of V$_2$WS$_4$ is predicted to be much higher than that of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$.

            <p>Measurements of the Fermi surface are a fundamental technique for determining the electrical and magnetic properties of solids. In 2D systems, the area and diameter of the Fermi surface is typically measured using Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and commensurability oscillations respectively. However, these techniques are unable to detect changes in the parity of the Fermi surface (i.e. when +k $\neq$ -k). Here, we show that transverse magnetic focussing can be used to detect such changes, because focussing only measures a well defined section of the Fermi surface and does not average over +k and -k. Furthermore, our results show that focussing is an order of magnitude more sensitive to changes in the Fermi surface than other 2D techniques, and could be used to investigate similar Fermi surface changes in other 2D systems.</p>

            <p>We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relation within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.</p>

            <p>We propose harnessing the tools of modern nano-fabrication to provide electrical control of exciton-polariton (EP) condensates. We develop the theory of a device based on the Josephson effect in which electric fields can be used to both switch between and monitor various dynamical modes. In particular, both the bias potential and the Josephson energy can be tuned electrically via the exciton component. We model the device by a Gross-Pitaevskii equation assuming that ideal EP condensates are established with well-balanced pumping and dissipation. We find that the EP condensates can be manipulated through degrees of freedom not easily accessible in other coherent quantum systems, and the dynamics of EP Josephson junctions are richer than that of the conventional superconducting junctions. The ability to control and monitor the condensate by both optical and electrical means allows new ways to study its physics not possible by either, alone.</p>

            <h2>The statistical mechanics and machine learning of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrew Jreissaty, Juan Carrasquilla</p>
            <p>We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-Rényi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the Rényi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting analytical arguments for the former and devising a Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-Rényi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-Rényi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Binary compound FeGe hosts multiple structures, from cubic and hexagonal to monoclinic. Compared to the well-known skyrmion lattice in the cubic phase and the antiferromagnetic charge-density wave in the hexagonal phase, the monoclinic FeGe is less explored. Here, we synthesized the monoclinic FeGe films on Al2O3 (001) and studied their structural, magnetic, and transport properties. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations indicate that the FeGe films are epitaxial to the substrate. Unlike the antiferromagnetic bulk, the monoclinic FeGe films are ferromagnetic with Curie-temperature as high as ~ 800 K, contributing to the anomalous Hall effect in the transport measurements. Similar to the hexagonal FeGe, we captured a structural phase transition in the monoclinic FeGe films at ~ 100 K in real and reciprocal spaces by transmission electron microscope. Our work enriches the phase diagram of the FeGe family and suggests that FeGe offers an ideal platform for studying multiphase transitions and related device applications.</p>

            <h2>Nonreciprocal Nonlinear Responses in Moving Charge Density Waves</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ying-Ming Xie, Hiroki Isobe, Naoto Nagaosa</p>
            <p>The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric Bergshoeff, Andrea Campoleoni, Giandomenico Palumbo, Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo</p>
            <p>Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</p>

            <p>Chloride molten salts are increasingly used in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding thermodynamic properties of these salts is essential to predict their critical characteristics and optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), have been utilized in the literature to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor is used to guide the model selection process for thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl3 system and provide statistical comparison of various models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable one based on available data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl3 system has been further modelled with uncertainty quantification (UQ) using MQMQA with the thermodynamic properties of compounds in KCl-LaCl3 predicted by the quasiharmonic approach in terms of first-principles phonon calculations as a function of temperature. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate thermodynamic model is important for accurately predicting critical characteristics of complex molten salts.</p>

            <h2>Scaling of contraction costs for entanglement renormalization algorithms including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Barthel, Qiang Miao</p>
            <p>The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.</p>

            <p>The hydrodynamic interactions among bacterial cell bodies, flagella, and surrounding boundaries are essential for understanding bacterial motility in complex environments. In this study, we demonstrate that each slender flagellum can be modeled as a series of spheres, and that the interactions between these spheres can be accurately characterized using a resistance matrix. This approach allows us to effectively and efficiently evaluate the propulsive effects of the flagella. Notably, our investigation into bacterial motility near a colloidal sphere reveals significant discrepancies between results derived from the twin multipole moment and those obtained through resistive force theory. Consequently, neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions among cell bodies, flagella, and colloidal spheres may lead to substantial inaccuracies. Our model simplifies bacteria into a series of spheres, making it well-suited for examining bacterial motility near spherical boundaries, as well as the nonlinear deformation dynamics of elastic flagella.</p>

            <h2>Topological phase transitions in perovskite superlattices driven by temperature, electric field, and doping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiyuan Yang, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the transmission properties of a junction between a normal metal and a p-wave magnet in the ballistic regime. We introduce a two-dimensional square lattice that confirms the p-wave magnet criteria. The $\alpha$-vector of the magnet breaks the inversion symmetry of the parabolic dispersion, shifting them in $k$-space. These shifts alter the propagation direction of fermions passing through the junction interface. Depending on spin orientation, the transmission process exhibits anisotropic, angle-dependent behavior. We also demonstrate a mirror symmetry between fermions with opposite spin directions, leading to the emergence of a transverse spin current that flows parallel to the interface. Additionally, we show that the $\alpha$-vector acts as a source for the dynamics of the spin-density wave and observe the formation of an indirect gap in the conductance of the junction. Our findings highlight the unique transmission characteristics and spin transport phenomena in normal metal/p-wave magnet junctions, paving the way for potential applications in spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. Although their coherence time is limited, flying electrons in the form of picosecond plasmonic pulses could be competitive in terms of the number of achievable coherent operations. The key challenge in achieving this critical milestone is the development of a new technology capable of injecting 'on-demand' single-electron wavepackets into quantum devices, with temporal durations comparable to or shorter than the device dimensions. Here, we take a significant step towards achieving this regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single-electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our results establish that quantum coherence is robust under the on-demand injection of ultrashort plasmonic pulses, as evidenced by the observation of coherent oscillations in the single-electron regime. Building on this, our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a new "non-adiabatic" regime that is prominent at high frequencies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localised qubit architectures, offering advantages such as a reduced hardware footprint, enhanced connectivity, and scalability for quantum information processing.</p>

            <p>Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</p>

            <p>Three types of cycles are identified in the quantum jump trajectories of the Scovil--Schulz-DuBois (SSDB) machine: an R-cycle as refrigeration, an H-cycle as a heat engine, and an N-cycle in which the machine is neutral. The statistics of these cycles are investigated via a semi-Markov process method. We find that in the large time limit, whether the machine operates as a heat engine or refrigerator depends on the ratio between the numbers of R-cycles and H-cycles per unit time. Further increasing the hot bath temperature above a certain threshold does not increase the machine's power output. The cause is that, in this situation, the N-cycle has a greater probability than the H-cycle and R-cycle. Although the SSDB machine operates by randomly switching between these three cycles, at the level of a single quantum jump trajectory, its heat engine efficiency and the refrigerator's coefficient of performance remain constant.</p>

            <p>We present an approach for evaluating Wannier functions, offering an alternative perspective on their role in many-body systems. Unlike traditional methods, such as the maximally localized Wannier functions approach, which focuses on minimizing the function tails, our approach emphasizes these tails. Using perturbative analytical approximations and extensive numerical simulations on an exactly solvable model, we address nonstandard Hubbard terms and demonstrate their critical influence on many-body dynamics. Specifically, we study tunneling dynamics in arbitrary double-well potentials, moving beyond the standard Hubbard model to include nonstandard terms such as density-induced tunneling and pair tunneling. Our results reveal that these terms significantly modify the dynamics predicted by the standard Hubbard model: density-induced tunneling modifies the single-particle tunneling parameter $\Omega_0$, while pair tunneling enables coherent propagation not captured by the standard model. We show that the discrepancies between the standard and nonstandard Hubbard models grow with increasing interaction strength, potentially leading to novel transport behaviors. However, at lower interaction strengths, both models converge, as nonstandard terms become negligible. These findings have important implications for phenomena such as superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and metal-insulator transitions. Our model aligns well with numerical simulations of lowest-band parameters and is strongly supported by experimental observations of second-order atom tunneling in optical double-well potentials. This strong agreement with experimental data highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach in providing a more comprehensive framework for describing complex many-body systems than the standard Hubbard model.</p>

            <p>We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($>10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Based on Weyl Orbits</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiong-Hao Wang, Yan-Bin Yang, Yong Xu</p>
            <p>The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.</p>

We focus first on a simple elastic network model with connectivity matrices (CMs) which are either annealed or quenched, at or out of equilibrium. The stress-fluctuation formalism relation for $\mu$ is rewritten as $\mu = \mu_1 + \mu_a$ with $\mu_1 \ge 0$ characterizing the variance of the quenched shear stresses and $\mu_a$ being a simple average over all states and CMs. For equilibrium CM-distributions $\mu_a$ becomes equivalent to the shear modulus of annealed systems, i.e. $\mu_a \ge 0$, while more generally $\mu_a$ may become strongly negative as shown by considering a temperature quench and a scalar active two-temperature model. Consistent relations are also found for glass-forming colloids where $\mu-\mu_1=\mu_a=0$ for equilibrium ensembles, i.e. $\mu$ is set by the quenched shear stresses, while $\mu_a$ becomes again negative otherwise.</p>

In this Letter, we derive a rigorous quantification of the Mpemba effect based on thermomajorization theory, referred to as the thermomajorization Mpemba effect. This approach resolves all existing ambiguities and provides a unification of the conventional Mpemba effect across all monotone measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the thermomajorization Mpemba effect for Markovian dynamics, rigorously proving that it can occur in any temperature regime with fixed energy levels.</p>

Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1<\alpha<3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Kinetic Theory of the Linear Response for Weakly Disordered Multiband Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thierry Valet, Roberto Raimondi</p>
            <p>A quantum kinetic theory of the linear response to an electric field is provided from a controlled expansion of the Keldysh theory at leading order, for a multiband electron system with weak scalar disorder. The response is uniquely partitioned into intraband distribution functions and interband quantum coherences. A new explicit formula is provided for the latter, outlining their true nature as local dependent quantities, for which the mesoscopic gradients of the former is uncovered as a source term, opening a new research area. The precise connection with the Kubo formula in the ladder approximation is established. A pedagogical application to spin-orbit torque theory in the two dimensional electron gas demonstrates the striking efficiency of the quantum kinetic approach. Some important implications for the theory of orbital transport are also briefly discussed.</p>

            <h2>Boundary Criticality in the 2d Random Quantum Ising Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gaurav Tenkila, Romain Vasseur, Andrew C. Potter</p>
            <p>The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</p>

            <h2>Spin orbit torque-driven motion of quasi-Bloch domain wall in perpendicularly magnetized W/CoFeB/MgO structure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nobuyuki Umetsu, Michael Quinsat, Susumu Hashimoto, Tsuyoshi Kondo, Masaki Kado</p>
            <p>The motion of chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied in heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study specifically focuses on SOT-driven DWs in near Bloch-states, which we refer to as ``quasi-Bloch DWs". These quasi-Bloch DWs exhibit slower motion compared to Neel-type DWs, offering potential for achieving highly controllable DW positions. Here, we investigate the characteristics of SOT-driven motion of quasi-Bloch DWs in perpendicularly magnetized ultra-thin films consisting of W/CoFeB/MgO. For analyzing the DW motion, we employ a one-dimensional model incorporating parameters derived from experimental data obtained from our samples. Our model successfully reproduces the experimental results, which reveal variations in the direction and threshold current density of DW motion among different samples. Through theoretical analysis, we unveil that the DW remains in quasi-Bloch states during motion, with SOT serving as the primary driving force rather than spin transfer torque (STT). The direction of motion is determined not only by the sign combination of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and spin Hall angle but also by the strength of DMI, STT, and extrinsic DW pinning. Furthermore, we provide analytical expressions for the threshold current density required for SOT-driven quasi-Bloch DW motion. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of future DW devices with specific film structures.</p>

            <h2>Defect engineering in two-dimensional pentagonal PdTe$_2$: Tuning electronic, optical, and magnetic properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Poonam Sharma, Vaishali Roondhe, Alok Shukla</p>
            <p>Recently, the successful synthesis of the pentagonal form of PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$) was reported [Liu~\emph{et al.}, Nature Materials \textbf{23}, 1339 (2024)]. In this work, we present an extensive first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) based computational study of vacancies in this material. Our study covers the evolution of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of various defect configurations and compares those to the pristine monolayer (\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$). We find that V$_{Pd}$ (V$_{Te}$) is the most stable defect in the~\emph{p}-PdTe$_{2}$ monolayer in the Te-rich (Pd-rich) limit. The defects alter the electronic properties of the monolayer significantly, leading to changes in their magnetic and optical properties due to the emergence of midgap impurity states. The defect complex V$_{Pd+4Te}$ is found to induce spin-polarization in the system with a total magnetic moment of 1.87 $\mu_{B}$. The obtained low diffusion energy barriers of 1.13 eV (in-plane) and 0.063 eV (top-bottom) corresponding to V$_{Te}$ indicates its facile migration probability is higher in the top-bottom direction at room temperature, as revealed by AIMD simulations as well. In order to guide the experimentalists, we also simulated the scanning-tunneling microscope (STM) images corresponding to all the defect configurations. Moreover, we also computed the electron-beam energies required for creating mono-vacancies. In the optical absorption spectra of the defective configurations, finite peaks appear below the band edge that are unique to the respective defective configuration. We have also computed the excess polarizability of the defective configurations with respect to the pristine one and found that maximum changes occur in the infrared and visible regions, providing insights into the change in their optical response as compared to the pristine monolayer.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessandro Simon, Luc Belloni, Daniel Borgis, Martin Oettel</p>
            <p>We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.</p>

            <p>Challenge to control the quantum states of matter via light have been at the forefront of modern research on driven quantum matter. We explore the imprinting effects of structured light on superconductors, demonstrating how the quantum numbers of light-specifically spin angular momentum, orbital angular momentum, and radial order-can be transferred to the superconducting order parameter and control vortex dynamics. Using Laguerre-Gaussian beams, we show that by tuning the quantum numbers and the amplitude of the electric field, it is possible to manipulate a variety of vortex behaviors, including breathing vortex pairs, braiding vortex pairs, vortex droplets, supervortices, and swirling 2D vortex rings. More complex structure of vortex-clusters, such as vortex-flake structures, and standing wave motions, also emerge under specific quantum numbers. These results demonstrate the ability to control SC vortex motion and phase structures through structured light, offering potential applications in quantum fluids and optical control of superconducting states. Our findings present a diagram that links light's quantum numbers to the resulting SC vortex behaviors, highlighting the capacity of light to transfer its symmetry onto superconducting condensates. We point that this approach represents the extension of the printing to quantum printing by light in a coherent state of electrons.</p>

            <p>We study evaporation and precipitate formation mechanics of bacteria-laden liquid bridge using experimental and theoretical analysis. Aqueous suspension of motile and non-motile Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa typically found in contaminated food and water were used in liquid bridge configuration between hydrophilic substrates. Using inverse logarithmic evaporation flux model, we study volume regression for cylindrical/catenoid volume models with confinement distance as a parameter. For all confinement distances, the regression is linear on normalizing both volume and time as in the case of pure sessile drop. However, in normalized volume and dimensional time space, we observe non-linearities as the evaporation time scales non linearly with the confinement distance. The non-linearities were captured using the catenoid model. The catenoid model conforms to the experimental volume regression data at all confinement distances, and the transient liquid bridge interface evolution profile at high confinement distance. We also study the precipitate pattern and bacterial distribution using micro/nano characterization techniques. We show the average precipitate pattern for both sessile and higher confinement distance resembles coffee ring type deposits although the underlying bacterial distribution differs. For lower confinement, we observe pattern resulting from a combination of coffee ring effect, stick-slick motion, and thin film instability. The reduction in confinement distance causes an altered bacterial agglomeration, resulting in a multi-pattern network instead of a single circumferential edge deposition. We show the aerial size of motile bacteria increases with decreasing confinement, whereas the size for non-motile bacteria remains constant in the precipitate.</p>

            <p>A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</p>

            <p>We report measurements of the local temperature-dependent penetration depth, $\lambda(T)$, in the Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = Cs, K, Rb) using scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy. Our results suggest that the superconducting order in all three compounds is fully gapped, in contrast to reports of nodal superconductivity in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Analysis of the temperature-dependent superfluid density, $\rho_s(T)$, shows deviations from the behavior expected for a single isotropic gap, but the data are well described by models incorporating either a single anisotropic gap or two isotropic gaps. Notably, the temperature dependences of $\lambda(T)$ and $\rho_s(T)$ in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ and RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ are qualitatively more similar to each other than to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, consistent with the superconducting phase reflecting features of the normal-state band structure. Our findings provide a direct comparison of the superconducting properties across the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.</p>

            <h2>Multiferroic collinear antiferromagnet with hidden altermagnetic split</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jin Matsuda, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita</p>
            <p>Altermagnets exhibit nonrelativistic spin splitting due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry and have been garnering significant attention as promising materials for spintronic applications. In contrast, conventional antiferromagnets without spin splitting seem not to have any symmetry breaking and have drawn less attention. However, we show that conventional antiferromagnets with a nonzero propagation vector (Q vector) bring about nontrivial symmetry breakings. The incompatibility between the Q vector and nonsymmorphic symmetry leads to macroscopic symmetry breaking without lifting spin degeneracy. Moreover, the hidden altermagnetic spin splitting in the electronic structure gives rise to various emergent responses. To examine our prediction, we perform first-principles calculations for MnS2 and investigate its multiferroic properties, such as nonlinear transport and optical activity. Our findings reveal unique properties in conventional antiferromagnets, providing another perspective for designing spintronic materials.</p>

            <p>"Pasta alla Cacio e pepe" is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio and pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the "Mozzarella Phase" and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.</p>

            <p>The development of solid-state batteries (SSBs) is hindered by degradation at solid-solid interfaces due to void formation and contact loss, resulting in increased impedance. Here, we systematically investigate the roles of real and unrecoverable interfacial contact areas at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface in driving the impedance rise. By controlling contact geometries and applied pressures, we identify their distinct contributions to the impedance spectra and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and transport. Experiments reveal that interfacial resistance varies strongly with recoverable contact area and applied pressure following power law scaling, with exponents of -1 and -0.5, respectively. Moreover, distributed contacts result in lower impedance due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Continuum simulations of the contact geometries predict interfacial resistances in agreement with experiments. Our work highlights the influence of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses on SSB impedance while quantifying the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.</p>

            <h2>Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</h2>

            <p>Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <p>Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation this http URL, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hao Chen, Thomas Barthel</p>
            <p>Tensor networks developed in the context of condensed matter physics try to approximate order-$N$ tensors with a reduced number of degrees of freedom that is only polynomial in $N$ and arranged as a network of partially contracted smaller tensors. As we have recently demonstrated in the context of quantum many-body physics, computation costs can be further substantially reduced by imposing constraints on the canonical polyadic (CP) rank of the tensors in such networks [arXiv:2205.15296]. Here, we demonstrate how tree tensor networks (TTN) with CP rank constraints and tensor dropout can be used in machine learning. The approach is found to outperform other tensor-network-based methods in Fashion-MNIST image classification. A low-rank TTN classifier with branching ratio $b=4$ reaches a test set accuracy of 90.3\% with low computation costs. Consisting of mostly linear elements, tensor network classifiers avoid the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. The CP rank constraints have additional advantages: The number of parameters can be decreased and tuned more freely to control overfitting, improve generalization properties, and reduce computation costs. They allow us to employ trees with large branching ratios, substantially improving the representation power.</p>

            <h2>Hyperballistic transport in dense systems of charged particles under ac electric fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daniele Gamba, Bingyu Cui, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.</p>

When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</p>

            <p>Life uses non-equilibrium mechanisms to create ordered structures not attainable at equilibrium; the resulting order is assumed to provide functional benefits that outweigh costs of time and energy needed by these mechanisms. Here, we show that models of DNA replication and self-assembly, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve error correcting mechanisms like kinetic proofreading and dynamic instability through selection for fast replication alone. We abstract these results into a general framework that predicts a counterintuitive ''order through speed'' effect if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. We test our results against recent mutational screens of proofreading polymerases. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can evolve even before that order is directly functional, with consequences for the evolution of mutation rates, viral capsid assembly, and the origin of life.</p>

We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d < 4$. Our results show that $N_c> 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition.

            <h2>Long-Range Quantum Tunneling via Matter Wave</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuan-Xing Yang, Si-Yuan Bai, Jun-Hong An</p>
            <p>Quantum tunneling is a quantum phenomenon in which a microscopic object crosses through a potential barrier even if its energy cannot overcome the barrier. A general belief is that tunneling occurs only when the barrier width is comparable to, or smaller than the de Broglie's wavelength of the object. Here, we study the tunneling of an ultracold atom among $N$ far-separated trapping potentials in a state-selective optical lattice and present a mechanism to realize long-range tunneling. We find that, mediated by the propagating matter wave emitted from the atom, coherent tunneling of the atom to the remote lattices occurs as long as bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the system formed by the atom and its matter wave. Going beyond the Markovian approximation, and breaking through the conventional distance constraint, our result opens another avenue to realizing tunneling and gives a guideline to developing tunneling devices.</p>

            <h2>Quantum noise induced nonreciprocity for single photon transport in parity-time symmetric systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dibyendu Roy, G. S. Agarwal</p>
            <p>We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</p>

            <h2>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas Schuster, Jonas Haferkamp, Hsin-Yuan Huang</p>
            <p>We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly}(\log \log n)$ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly}(\log n)$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing PRU constructions. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thorsten B. Wahl, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Adrien Bouhon, Gaurav Chaudhary, Robert-Jan Slager</p>
            <p>We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</p>

            <h2>Efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic and acoustic systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Xin Sha, Ming-Yao Xia, Ling Lu, Yi Yang</p>
            <p>Topological photonics and acoustics have recently garnered wide research interests for their topological ability to manipulate the light and sound at surfaces. Conventionally, the supercell technique is the standard approach to calculating these boundary effects, whereas it consumes increasingly large computational resources as the supercell size grows. Additionally, it falls short in differentiating the surface states at opposite boundaries and from bulk states due to the finite size of systems. To overcome the limitations, here we provide two complementary efficient methods for obtaining the ideal topological surface states of a semi-infinite system. The first one is the cyclic reduction method, which is based on iteratively inverting the Hamiltonian for a single unit cell, and the other is the transfer matrix method, which relies on the eigenanalysis of a transfer matrix for a pair of unit cells. Benchmarks show that, compared to the traditional supercell method, the cyclic reduction method can reduce both memory and time consumption by two orders of magnitude; the transfer matrix method can reduce memory by an order of magnitude, take less than half the time, and achieve high accuracy. Our methods are applicable to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. As examples, the surface-density-of-states spectra of photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are demonstrated. Our computational schemes enable direct comparisons with near-field scanning measurements and expedite the exploration of topological artificial materials and the design of topological devices.</p>

            <h2>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</p>

            <p>This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots (QD) embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization (ED) and the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase (TP), the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Bahulikar, Feng Wang, Mustafa Cenk Gursoy, Rodrick Kuate Defo</p>
            <p>We present a symmetry-agnostic topology optimization framework for photonic-crystal structures based on computation of the photonic density of states in a manner analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration. We provide a generalization of the approach that allows for computations at different scales with the additional scales being analogous to integration over the full Brillouin zone and to regimes between the two limiting cases of full Brillouin-zone integration and $\Gamma$-point integration, though these other scales do not preserve the symmetry-agnostic nature of the $\Gamma$-point framework. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the problem of inverting photonic or phononic bandstructures and to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that at the symmetry-agnostic scale analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration, we can recover a known two-dimensional photonic crystal for the TM polarization. A key insight of our work is the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic bandgap must be sampled in order to observe photonic-crystal structures.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu Nakayama</p>
            <p>Inspired by the possibility of emergent supersymmetry in critical random systems, we study a field theory model with a quartic potential of one superfield, possessing the Parisi-Sourlas supertranslation symmetry. Within perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion, we find nine non-trivial scale invariant renormalization group fixed points, but only one of them is conformal. We, however, believe scale invariance without conformal invariance cannot occur without a sophisticated mechanism because it predicts the existence of a non-conserved but non-renormalized vector operator called virial current, whose existence must be non-generic. We show that the virial current in this model is related to the supercurrent by supertranslation. The supertranslation Ward-Takahashi identity circumvents the genericity argument, explaining its non-renormalization property.</p>

We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</p>

            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <p>The tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicals and diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low-lying excited states by fine-tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM-derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation on TTM-derived diradicals to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis focuses on a series of symmetric TTM-derived diradicals with singlet ground state, featuring radical moieties linked by pi-conjugated spacers of different length. The nature of the lowest excited electronic states that control their photophysical behaviour is discussed in detail. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM-TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The lowest excited states of the diradicals differ qualitatively from those of TTM: two novel low-lying states emerge in the diradical, due to charge resonance (CR) between the two radical units. The lowest CR state is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue-shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM-ph-TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM-derived diradicals</p>

            <p>Motivated by recent experiments, we study the coupling of quantum Hall (QH) hydrodynamics to quantum electrodynamics (QED) within a resonance cavity. In agreement with experimental observations, we find that the Hall conductivity remains unchanged. However, the coupling to the cavity induces a second-order quantum reactance effect, contributing distinctly to the longitudinal AC conductivity. This effect arises from the exchange of energy between the QH fluid and cavity photons. Beyond the topological response, we show that the cavity couples to collective excitations, resulting in a shift of the Kohn mode frequency. Our methods are broadly applicable to both integral and fractional QH liquids, and our results offer a universal perspective on the protection of topological properties against long-range interactions induced by electromagnetic cavity modes.</p>

            <p>The primary function of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to convert electrons into photons. However, only 25 % of the electronic states (singlets) in electrically excited fluorescent molecules can emit light, which is why triplet harvesting has attracted significant attention. Specifically, one often aims to maximize the rate of triplet-to-singlet conversion, while at the same time, it is crucial to depopulate the singlets fast enough -- before they convert to triplets or interact with other excited states, potentially breaking molecular bonds. Planar microcavities provide a viable architecture to address these issues. By confining the emitters within planar microcavities one can couple the excitons to cavity modes and engineer the population dynamics to one's liking. While the weak-coupling regime is renowned for Purcell-enhanced emission, strongly coupled excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates known as polaritons. To fully understand and optimize exciton-photon interactions and light-emission mechanisms across various coupling regimes, a unified theory of optically coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs is needed. In this article, we introduce a quantum master equation model spanning the zero-, weak-, and strong-coupling regimes. We derive the different rates using Fermi's golden rule and Marcus theory, show how the different regimes converge, and finally evaluate the internal quantum efficiencies in all cases.</p>

The exciton condensation in the lowest Landau levels is triggered by Coulomb interactions in the vicinity of $B_{\rm c}$ at low temperature and spontaneously breaks the inversion and the spin rotation symmetries. We propose that the electron spin resonance spectroscopy with the ac magnetic field also aligned in the perpendicular direction can directly probe the exciton condensation order. Our results should apply to QSHIs such as the InAs/GaSb quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</p>

            <p>Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</p>

In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below, and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Investigation of Yield-Enhancing Equilibrium Sn$V^-$ Preparation Pathways in N-Doped Diamond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aditya Bahulikar, Steven L. Richardson, Rodrick Kuate Defo</p>
            <p>The elucidation of the mechanism of Sn$V^-$ formation in diamond is especially important as the Sn$V^-$ color center has the potential to be a superior single-photon emitter when compared to the N$V$ and to other Group IV color centers. The typical formation of the Sn$V$ involves placing Sn in diamond by ion implantation, but the formation of a charged Sn$V$ species requires an additional complication. This complication is related to the energy cost associated with electronic transitions within the host diamond. Effectively, producing the Sn$V^-$ charge state using an electron obtained from a band edge of the host diamond is less energetically favorable than having the Sn$V^-$ receive an electron from a neighboring donor dopant. Among donor dopants, substitutional N (N$_\text{C}$) is always present in even the purest synthetic or natural diamond sample. The mechanism of electron donation by N$_\text{C}$ has been proposed by Collins for charging the N$V$ in diamond and it has been used to interpret many experimental results. Therefore, in this paper we use DFT to explore the pathways for the formation of the Sn$V^-$ charge state due to electron donation arising from the presence of N$_\text{C}$ in the host diamond. Explicitly, defect concentrations are calculated in equilibrium in each of the explored pathways to determine the yield of the Sn$V^-$ throughout each of the pathways. The importance of our work is to suggest experimental ways of enhancing the yield of charged states like the Sn$V^-$ in diamond for transformative applications in optoelectronics and quantum information.</p>

            <p>A knowledge gap exists for flows and transport phenomena at the Angstrom scale when the Poisson Nernst Planck equation based on the concept of electrical double layer (EDL) fails. We discovered that streaming conductance becomes pressure dependent in Angstrom channels using latent track membranes. The streaming current emerges only when the applied pressure exceeds a threshold value, which is inconsistent with the existing knowledge as a constant. With increasing channel size, we found that the pressure dependent streaming conductance phenomenon weakens and vanishes into a constant streaming conductance regime when the mean channel radius exceeds 2 nm. The effective surface potential derived from the stream conductance that divides conduction anomalously increases as the channel narrows. We suspect the pressure dependent streaming current is due to the reinforced Coulomb interaction between counterions and deprotonated carboxyl groups at the surface, which is close to the ion channel but different from the electrified 2D materials. The streaming current emerged due to hydrodynamic friction when the counterions were released from the surface. We approximated the stochastic process of counterion dissociation by 1D Kramer escape theory framework and defined the Damkohler Number to describe the transition from nonlinear streaming conductance regime to linear regime as functions of applied pressure and channel radius and well explained the enhanced effective surface potential in confinement.</p>

            <p>Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moiré materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Yang, Chao Chen, Runyu Ma, Ying Liang, Tianxing Ma</p>
            <p>A recently discovered family of Kagome lattice materials, $\emph{A}\mathrm{V}_{3}\mathrm{Sb}_{5}$($\emph{A}$= $\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs}$), has attracted great interest, especially in the debate over its dominant superconducting pairing symmetry. To explore this issue, we study the superconducting pairing behavior within the Kagome-Hubbard model through the constrained path Monte Carlo method. It is found that doping around the Dirac point generates a dominant next-nearest-neighbour-$d$ pairing symmetry driven by on-site Coulomb interaction $U$. However, when considering the nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, it may induce nearest-neighbor-$p$ pairing to become the preferred pairing symmetry. Our results provide useful information to identify the dominant superconducting pairing symmetry in $\emph{A}\mathrm{V}_{3}\mathrm{Sb}_{5}$ family.</p>

            <p>Phonon polaritons are hybrid modes combining lattice dynamics and electromagnetic waves. Their behavior at long wavelengths is effectively described by Huang's equations. Here, we investigate phonon polaritons within 2D materials featuring twisted moiré structures. The interaction between electromagnetic waves and phonons of varying wavelengths gives rise to rich polaritons with moiré characteristics. We observe the polariton dividing into multiple branches, akin to coupled oscillators. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. A distinctive trait of moiré polar crystals is their spatially varying near-field response, offering robust signals for the experimental confirmation.</p>

            <p>Magnetic-free nonreciprocal optical devices that can prevent backscattering of signals are essential for integrated optical information processing. The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely on various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise to dispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatial broadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformation inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components for information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the nonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moiré photonic lattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or counter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two identical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output pattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localization in the forward case is derived from the moiré structure, and the nonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity) are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. The thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent condition for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case, because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the coupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the transverse beam profile in one-way transmission.</p>

In this work, we introduce and demonstrate the concept of a \textit{molecular optical bond}, resulting from the far-field electromagnetic coupling of several molecules via a shared mode of an optical microcavity. We discuss a collective enhancement of the vacuum Rabi splitting and study super- and sub-radiant states that arise from the cavity-mediated coupling both in the resonant and dispersive regimes. Moreover, we demonstrate a two-photon transition that emerges between the ground and excited states of the new optical compound. Our experimental data are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and open the door to the realization of hybrid light-matter materials.</p>

            <p>Optically active defects often play a crucial role in governing the light emission as well as the electronic properties of materials. Moreover, defect-mediated states in the mid-gap region can trap electrons, thus opening a path for the recombination of electrons and holes in lower energy states that may require phonons in the process. Considering this, we have probed electron-phonon interaction in halide perovskite systems with the introduction of defects and investigated the thermal effect on this interaction. Here, we report Raman spectroscopy study of the thermal evolution of electron-phonon coupling, which is tunable with the crystal growth conditions, in the halide perovskite systems Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2NaInCl6. The signature of electron-phonon coupling is observed as a Fano anomaly in the lowest frequency phonon mode (51 cm-1) which evolves with temperature. In addition, we observe a broad band in the photoluminescence (PL) measurements for the defect-mediated systems, which is otherwise absent in defect-free halide perovskite. The simultaneous observation of the Fano anomaly in the Raman spectrum and the emergence of the PL band suggests the defect-mediated mid-gap states and the consequent existence of electron-phonon coupling in the double perovskite.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity and nontrivial topology are highly sought-after phenomena in quantum materials. While many topological crystalline materials have been found to exhibit superconductivity, their presence in quasicrystals - materials with a unique aperiodic yet ordered structure - has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we report the discovery of superconductivity in a monoclinic approximant to the decagonal quasicrystal Al$_{13}$Os$_{4}$, that exhibits a high superconducting transition temperature and a nontrivial electronic structure. The resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and $\mu$SR measurements confirm superconductivity with a critical temperature of $\sim5.47$ K. Detailed electronic structure and symmetry analysis reveal nontrivial state with $\mathcal{Z}_{2}=1$ and spin-polarized conducting surface states. Importantly, we identify three-dimensional saddle point van Hove singularities with substantial flat energy dispersion at the Fermi level, which can enhance superconductivity. Our results highlight a rich interplay between superconductivity and nontrivial electronic states in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4}$, demonstrating it as a unique platform for exploring unconventional superconducting states in quasicrystalline materials.</p>

We used the GPTArticleExtractor workflow, powered by large language models (LLM), to extract and curate data automatically from the scientific literature published in Elsevier journals. This process enabled the creation of a structured database that addresses the challenges of manual data collection. The open access database could stimulate data-driven research and advance thermoelectric material analysis and discovery.</p>

            <h2>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xi Chen, Fa-Jie Wang, Zhen Bi, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of intrinsic STI - which has no band insulator correspondence - characterized by the half-quantized magneto-electric polarization $P_3\!=\!\theta/(2\pi)$. A $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$. However, we prove that, if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$, the topological state with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ cannot be realized in band insulators where $C_{4}T$ is exact. Surprisingly, using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find that an STI with $\theta\!=\!\pi$ can arise in Anderson insulators with disorders respecting $C_{4}T$ on average. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and examine its phase diagram using the transfer matrix method up to the largest numerically accessible system size. An STI phase is identified through delocalized surface states and a half-quantized magneto-electric polarization in the bulk. As expected, an unavoidable gapless phase separates the STI from both clean insulators and trivial Anderson insulators, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. Moreover, we argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions, i.e., interactions cannot open an adiabatic path connecting the STI to a gapped clean system. Thus, our work provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization. We also generalize the discussion to other crystalline symmetries.</p>

            <p>In Co$_x$NbSe$_2$, crystal symmetry, and cobalt site occupation drive the formation of two distinct magnetic phases. At $x = 1/4$, the centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$/$mmc$) promotes Co-Co interactions leading to the formation of an $A$-type antiferromagnetic structure phase with a transition temperature of $T_N^A$ = 169 K. At $x = 1/3$, the non-centrosymmetric structure ($P$6$_3$22) induces a lower-temperature magnetic phase with $T_N^S$ = 28 K. We report the coexistence of both substructures within a superlattice, with a nuclear propagation vector of (1/3, 1/3, 0) relative to the host lattice. Single crystals of Co$_{0.28}$NbSe$_2$ exhibit both magnetic transitions, with $T_N^A$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/4$ phase and $T_N^S$ corresponding to the $x \sim 1/3$ phase. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements confirm these transitions, although only the high-temperature $T_N^A$ phase significantly affects resistivity. We successfully isolate each phase in powder samples, while single crystals with an intercalation ratio of $x = 0.28$ display the coexistence of both phases in a single sample. Using single-crystal neutron diffraction, we solved the magnetic structure of the high-temperature centrosymmetric phase ($T_N^A$), and neutron powder diffraction revealed the double-$q$ magnetic structure of the low-temperature noncentrosymmetric phase ($T_N^S$)</p>

            <p>The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has emerged as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics and material science. However, standard LBM formulation imposes some limitations on the applications of the method, particularly compressible fluids. In this paper, we introduce a new velocity discretization method to overcome some of these challenges. In this new formulation, the particle populations are discretized using a bump function that has a mean and a variance. This introduces enough independent degrees of freedom to set the equilibrium moments to the moments of Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution up to and including the third moments. Consequently, the correct macroscopic fluid dynamics equations for compressible fluids are recovered. We validate our method using several benchmark simulations.</p>

            <p>Active colloidal particles typically exhibit a pronounced affinity for accumulating and being captured at boundaries. Here, we engineer long-range repulsive interactions between colloids that self-propel under an electric field and patterned obstacles. As a result of these interactions, particles turn away from obstacles and avoid accumulation. We show that by tuning the applied field frequency, we precisely and rapidly control the effective size of the obstacles and therefore modulate the particle approach distance. This feature allows us to achieve gating and tunable confinement of our active particles whereby they can access regions between obstacles depending on the applied field. Our work provides a versatile means to directly control confinement and organization, paving the way towards applications such as sorting particles based on motility or localizing active particles on demand.</p>

            <p>Cells and microorganisms employ dynamic shape changes to enable steering and avoidance for efficient spatial exploration and collective organization. In contrast, active colloids, their synthetic counterparts, currently lack similar abilities and strategies. Through physical interactions alone, here we create active colloidal molecules that spontaneously reconfigure their structure, unlike traditional active particles. We find that self-reconfiguration decouples reorientational dynamics from rotational diffusivity and bestows our active molecules additional reorientation capabilities. During encounters with neighbors, rapid conformational changes lead to self-steering and avoidance. At higher area fractions, reconfiguration-induced avoidance fully inhibits characteristic dynamic clustering, motility-induced phase separation and flocking; instead, the system retains a homogeneous structure comprising well-separated active units. Self-reconfiguring systems therefore present an exciting path towards autonomous motion beyond that of classical synthetic active matter.</p>

            <p>Ultrafast and nanoscale heat conduction demands a unified theoretical framework that rigorously bridges macroscopic transport equations with microscopic material properties derived from statistical this http URL empirical generalizations of Fourier's law often lack a solid microscopic foundation, failing to connect observed non-Fourier behavior with underlying atomic scale mechanisms. In this work, we present a time-domain theory of transient heat conduction rooted in Zwanzig's statistical theory of irreversible processes. Central to this framework is the time-domain transport function, Z(t), defined through equilibrium time-correlation functions of heat fluxes. This function generalizes the conventional concept of steady-state thermal conductivity, governing the transition of conduction dynamics from onset second sound type wave propagation at finite speeds to diffusion-dominated behavior across broad temporal and spatial scales. Unlike phonon hydrodynamic models that rely on mesoscopic constructs such as phonon drift velocity, our approach provides a quantitative and microscopic description of intrinsic memory effects in transient heat fluxes and applies universally to bulk materials at any temperature or length scale. By integrating atomistic-scale first-principles calculations with continuum-level macroscopic equations, this framework offers a robust foundation for numerical simulations of transient temperature fields. Furthermore, it facilitates the interpretation and design of transient thermal grating experiments using nanometer-scale heat sources and ultrafast laser systems in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray wavelength ranges, advancing our understanding of heat dissipation dynamics.</p>

            <p>The Hebel-Slichter coherence peak, observed in the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ just below the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, serves as a crucial experimental validation of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing symmetry in conventional superconductors. However, no coherence peak in $1/T_1$ has been observed in unconventional superconductors like cuprates. In this study, an unconventional coherence peak is identified for the first time using nuclear quadrupole resonance on YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, pointing to a distinctive pairing symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in nuclear quadrupole resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance with nuclear spin $I>1/2$ comprises the magnetic relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, which probes magnetic fluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\rm quad}$, which probes charge fluctuations. By utilizing $^{63}$Cu and $^{65}$Cu isotopes, we successfully distinguish $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$ and $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ and reveal the presence of the coherence peak in $1/T_{1 }^{\rm quad}$ but not in $1/T_{1}^{\rm mag}$, in contrast to conventional superconductors. Our finding demonstrates that unconventional superconductors do not exhibit a coherence peak in $1/T_{1}$ when the relaxation is due to fluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a coherence peak is expected when the relaxation is caused by electric field gradient fluctuations, due to the different coherence factors between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our successful measurements of $1/T_{1}$ for the chains of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ suggest that, should the conditions for predominant quadrupole relaxation be satisfied, this phenomenon could provide a novel approach to exploring the unconventional nature of the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.</p>

            <p>According to the theory of group representations, the types of band degeneracy can be divided into accidental degeneracy and essential degeneracy. The essentially degenerate nodal lines (NLs) are typically resided on the high-symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. Here, we propose a type of NL in two dimension that is essentially degenerate but is hidden within the high-symmetry planes, making it less observable, dubbed a hidden-essential nodal line (HENL). The existence of HENL is guaranteed as long as the system hosts a horizontal glide-mirror symmetry, hence such NLs can be widely found in both non-magnetic and magnetic systems. We perform an exhaustive search over all 528 magnetic layer groups (MLGs) for HENL that can be enforced by glide-mirror symmetry with both spinless and spinfull systems. We find that 122 candidate MLGs host spinless HENL, while 63 candidate MLGs demonstrate spinful HENL. In addition, we reveal that horizontal mirror and time-reversal symmetry in type-II and type-IV MLGs with spin-orbital coupling can enforce HENL formed. The 15 corresponding candidate MLGs have also been presented. Furthemore, we derive a few typical lattice models to characterize the existence for the HENL. For specific electronic fillings in real materials, namely 4$N$+2 in spinless systems (and 2$N$+1 in spinful systems), the presence of the HENLs in candidate MLGs is required regardless of the details of the systems. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations, we further identify possible material candidates that realize spinless and spinful HENL. Moreover, spinful HENLs exhibit a novel persistent spin texture wih the characteristic of momentum-independent spin configuration. Our findings uncover a new type of topological semimetal state and offer an ideal platform to study the related physics of HENLs.</p>

            <p>Ferromagnetic metals, with the potential to generate spin current with unconventional spin polarization via the spin Hall effect, offer promising opportunities for field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization and for the spin-orbit torque devices. In this study, we investigate two distinct spin Hall mechanisms in 3d ferromagnetic metals including spin-orbit coupling driven spin Hall effect in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys, and non-relativistic spin Hall effect arising from anisotropic spin-polarized transport by taking L10-MnAl as an example. By employing first-principles calculations, we examine the temperature and alloy composition dependence of spin Hall conductivity in Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys. Our results reveal that the spin Hall conductivities with out-of-plane spin polarization in 3d ferromagnetic metals are at the order of 1000 \frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1} at 300 K, but with a relatively low spin Hall angles around 0.01~0.02 due to the large longitudinal conductivity. For L10-MnAl(101), the non-relativistic spin Hall conductivity can reach up to 10000\frac{\hbar}{2e} \left( \Omega \, \text{cm} \right)^{-1}, with a giant spin Hall angle around 0.25 at room temperature. By analyzing the magnetization switching process, we demonstrate deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization without an external magnetic field by using 3d ferromagnetic metals as spin current sources. Our work may provide an unambiguous understanding on spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals and pave the way for their potential applications in related spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Genuine and Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in van der Waals Multiferroic Tunnel Junctions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu</p>
            <p>Van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) are promising candidates for data storage devices due to their tunable thickness and capability to exhibit multiple nonvolatile resistance states. However, existing vdW-MFTJs utilize ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism independently, failing to achieve true magnetoelectric coupling, which leads to unnecessary energy dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative vdW-MFTJ design based on a CrBr$_3$/MnPSe$_3$/CrBr$_3$ vertical heterostructure, enabling genuine magnetoelectric coupling without relying on atomic migration induced by inversion symmetry breaking for ferroelectric polarization reversal. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, the highest value reported to date. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Longitudinal Spin Hall Magnetoresistance from Spin Fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ping Tang</p>
            <p>Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), the variation in resistance in a heavy metal (HM) with the magnetization orientation of an adjacent ferromagnet (FM), has been extensively studied as a powerful tool for probing surface magnetic moments in a variety of magnetic materials. However, the conventional SMR theory assumes rigid magnetization of a fixed magnitude, an assumption that breaks down close to the FM's Curie temperature \(T_c\), where the magnetic susceptibility diverges. Here, we report an unconventional SMR effect arising from the magnetic-field modulation of spin fluctuations in the FM, while its magnetization remaining collinear to the spin Hall accumulation in the HM. In contrast to the conventional SMR, which scales with the magnetization and vanishes near $T_{c}$, such ``longitudinal" SMR (LSMR), though suppressed at low temperatures, becomes critically enhanced at \(T_c\), reaching a magnitude comparable to conventional SMR amplitudes. Our findings suggest a promising method for electrically detecting enhanced spin fluctuations in magnetic systems.</p>

            <h2>Chiral induced Spin Polarized Electron Current: Origin of the Chiral Induced Spin Selectivity Effect</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Fransson</p>
            <p>The discovery of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect has provided a novel tool to study how active physical and chemical mechanism may differ in chiral enantiomers, however, the origin of the effect itself is yet an open question. In this article, it is theoretically shown that two aspects have to be fulfilled for the chiral induced spin selectivity effect to arise. First, chirality is a necessary condition for breaking spin-degeneracy in molecular structures that do not comprise heavy elements. Second, dissipation is indispensable for the molecule to develop a non-vanishing spin-polarization. These theoretical conclusions are illustrated in terms of a few examples, showing the necessity of the two aspects to be coordinated for the emergence of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect.</p>

            <h2>Current-induced re-entrant superconductivity and extreme nonreciprocal superconducting diode effect in valley-polarized systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Chen Zhuang, Qing-Feng Sun</p>
            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE) refers to the nonreciprocity of superconducting critical currents for the metal-superconductor transition. Generally, the SDE has a positive and a negative critical current $j_{c\pm}$ corresponding to two opposite directions whose amplitudes are unequal. It is demonstrated that an extreme nonreciprocity where two critical currents can become both positive (or negative) has been observed in a recent experiment. In this work, we theoretically propose a possible mechanism to realize an extreme nonreciprocal SDE. Based on a microscopic theory and a simple valley-polarized model, we demonstrate that depairing currents required to dissolve Cooper pairs can be remodulated under the interplay between the valley polarization and the applied current. Near the disappearance of the superconductivity, the remodulation is shown to induce the extreme nonreciprocity and also the current-induced re-entrant superconductivity where the system has two different critical current intervals. Our study may provide new horizons for understanding the coexistence of superconductivity and spontaneous ferromagnetism and pave a new way to designing the SDE with 100% efficiency.</p>

            <p>The Landauer-Büttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiang-Ping Jiang, Mingdi Xu, Xuanpu Yang, Yucheng Wang, Lei Pan</p>
            <p>A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.</p>

            <p>Atomic migration from metallic contacts, and subsequent filament formation, is recognised as a prevailing mechanism leading to resistive switching in memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs). This study presents a detailed atomistic examination of the migration of different metal atoms across the grain boundaries (GBs) of 2DMs, employing Density Functional Theory in conjunction with Non-Equilibrium Green's Function transport simulations. Various types of metallic atoms, Au, Cu, Al, Ni, and Ag, are examined, focusing on their migration both in the out-of-plane direction through a MoS\textsubscript{2} layer and along the surface of the MoS\textsubscript{2} layer, pertinent to filament formation in vertical and lateral memristors, respectively. Different types of GBs usually present in MoS\textsubscript{2} are considered to assess their influence on the diffusion of metal atoms. The findings are compared with structures based on pristine MoS\textsubscript{2} and those with mono-sulfur vacancies, aiming to understand the key elements that affect the switching performance of memristors. Furthermore, transport simulations are carried out to evaluate the effects of GBs on both out-of-plane and in-plane electron conductance, providing valuable insights into the resistive switching ratio.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rafna Rafeek, Debasish Mondal</p>
            <p>The information engine extracts work from a single heat bath using mutual information obtained during the operation cycle. This study investigates the influence of the potential shaping in a Brownian information engine (BIE) in harnessing the information from thermal fluctuations. We have designed a BIE by considering an overdamped Brownian particle inside a confined potential and introducing an appropriate symmetric feedback cycle. We find that the upper bound of the extractable work for a BIE with a monostable centrosymmetric confining potential, with a stable state at the potential centre, depends on the bath temperature and the convexity of the confinement. A concave confinement is more efficient for an information-energy exchange. For a bistable confinement with an unstable centre and two symmetric stable basins, one can find an engine-to-refrigeration transition beyond a certain barrier height related to the energy difference between the energy barrier and the stable basins. Finally, we use the concavity-induced gain in information harnessing to device a BIE in the presence of a multistable potential that can harvest even more energy than monostable confinement.</p>

            <p>Anisotropic materials with low symmetries hold significant promise for next-generation electronic and quantum devices. 2M-WS2, a candidate for topological superconductivity, has garnered considerable interest. However, a comprehensive understanding of how its anisotropic features contribute to unconventional superconductivity, along with a simple, reliable method to identify its crystal orientation, remains elusive. Here, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate angle- and polarization-dependent anisotropic Raman modes of 2M-WS2. Through first-principles calculations, we predict and analyze phonon dispersion and lattice vibrations of all Raman modes in 2M-WS2. We establish a direct correlation between their anisotropic Raman spectra and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Finally, we demonstrate that anisotropic Raman spectroscopy can accurately determine the crystal orientation and twist angle between two stacked 2M-WS2 layers. Our findings provide insights into the electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic properties of 2M-WS2, paving the way for the use of anisotropic materials in advanced electronic and quantum devices.</p>

            <h2>Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sarah I. Allec, Maxim Ziatdinov</p>
            <p>Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.</p>

            <h2>New Insights into the Dependence of Glass Transition Temperature and Dynamic Fragility on Molecular Weight in Oligomers and Polymers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Oleg V. Gendelman, Riccardo Casalini, Alessio Zaccone</p>
            <p>In an earlier preprint (V. V. Ginzburg, O. V. Gendelman, R. Casalini, and A. Zaccone, arXiv:2409.17291), we demonstrated that the dynamic (relaxation time) and volume equations of state for many amorphous polymers are near-universal -- each material is characterized by two governing parameters -- the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, and the elementary relaxation time, /tau_{el}. The dynamic fragility, m, is uniquely related to /tau_{el}. The earlier analysis was based on the data for high polymers (degree of polymerization, N > 200, and molecular weight, Mw > 20,000 g/mol). Here, we investigate the dependence of T_{g} and /tau_{el} on N (or, equivalently, on the molecular weight, M). We consider the dielectric spectroscopy data for homologous series of four polymers: polystyrene (PS), poly-(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and polybutadiene (PB). It is shown that the relaxation time curves for various oligomers can be successfully collapsed onto the same master curve as the high polymers. The glass transition temperature and the dynamic fragility are found to be linear functions of 1/M, in agreement with the Fox-Flory equation. The scaling results are interpreted based on the SL-TS2 theory, ensuring that the model description is consistent with the Boyer rules for the coefficients of thermal expansion above and below T_{g}, as well as the thermodynamical scaling for the pressure dependence of the relaxation time.</p>

            <p>We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a non-trivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a non-trivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topologically quantized jump and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the non-interacting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order nonlinear optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced steady dc currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</p>

            <p>We report on magnetic anisotropy modulation in Bismuth substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Bi-YIG) thin films and mesoscale patterned structures deposited on a PMN-PT substrate with the application of voltage-induced strain. The Bi content is selected for low coercivity and higher magnetostriction than that of YIG, yielding significant changes in the hysteresis loops through the magnetoelastic effect. The piezoelectric substrate is poled along its thickness, which is the [011] direction, by applying a voltage across the PMN-PT/SiO2/Bi-YIG/Pt heterostructure. In-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (MOKE) shows the modulation of magnetic anisotropy with voltage-induced strain. Furthermore, voltage control of the magnetic domain state of the Bi-YIG film at a fixed magnetic field produces a 90° switching of the magnetization easy axis above a threshold voltage. The magnetoelectric coefficient of the heterostructure is 1.05x10^(-7)s/m which is competitive with that of other ferromagnetic oxide films on ferroelectric substrates such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/PMNPT and YIG/PMN-PZT. Voltage-control of magnetization reversal fields in 5-30 microns wide dots and racetracks of Bi-YIG show potential for energy efficient non-volatile memory and neuromorphic computing devices.</p>

In this work, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$, a metal that features a niobium-based kagome lattice and a frustrated triangular gadolinium network. The compound adopts the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type crystal structure, with lattice parameters of a = b = 5.765(4) Å and c = 9.536(8) Å. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements reveal a magnetic transition near 2.3 K. Electrical transport data confirm metallic behavior, unsaturated positive magnetoresistance, and a hole-dominated multiband Hall effect. Furthermore, first-principles calculations indicate that Nb-4d orbitals predominantly contribute to the electronic states near the Fermi energy, with the band structure showing multiple topologically nontrivial crossings around the Fermi surface. This study also compares GdNb$_6$Sn$_6$ with GdV$_6$Sn$_6$, highlighting their similarities and differences.

            <p>Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds are recently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from unperturbed trajectory data, offering practical advantages for studying complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.</p>

Recently, the density of the topological defects formed via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism was computed for a system cooled through a first-order phase transition instead of the usual continuous transitions. Here we address the problem of whether such defects generated across a first-order phase transition exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling similar to the case in continuous phase transitions. We show that any possible Kibble-Zurek scaling for the topological defects can only be a very rough approximation due to an intrinsic field for the scaling. However, complete universal scaling for other properties does exist.</p>

In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-based framework to predict exciton binding energies in 2D materials, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional methods such as many-body perturbation theory (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Leveraging data from the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), our ML models establish connections between cheaply available material descriptors and complex excitonic properties, significantly accelerating the screening process for materials with pronounced excitonic effects. Additionally, Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression was employed to efficiently filter materials with largest exciton binding energies, further enhancing the discovery process. Although developed for 2D systems, this approach is versatile and can be extended to three-dimensional materials, broadening its applicability in materials discovery.</p>

Yet, what is a factor $\beta$ here and are there any fundamental limits on how large it can be? Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, characterized by $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. We argue that with a further improvement of annealing protocols, post-processing algorithms and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. We provide a theoretical argumentation for this observation based on statistical analysis of low energy states.</p>

            <p>Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.</p>

            <p>While stochastic resetting (or total resetting) is less young and more established concept in stochastic processes, partial stochastic resetting (PSR) is a relatively new field. PSR means that, at random moments in time, a stochastic process gets multiplied by a factor between 0 and 1, thus approaching but not reaching the resetting position. In this paper, we present new results on PSR highlighting the main similarities and discrepancies with total resetting. Specifically, we consider both symmetric $\alpha$-stable Lévy processes (Lévy flights) and Brownian motion with PSR in arbitrary d dimensions. We derive explicit expressions for the propagator and its stationary measure, and discuss in detail their asymptotic behavior. Interestingly, while approaching to stationarity, a dynamical phase transition occurs for the Brownian motion, but not for Lévy flights. We also analyze the behavior of the process around the resetting position and find significant differences between PSR and total resetting.</p>

            <h2>Terahertz Magnon Excitations and Switching in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Durga Prasad Goli, Se Kwon Kim</p>
            <p>We investigate how spatiotemporal spin polarized current can lead to terahertz frequency excitations in non-collinear antiferromagnets. By solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically for non-collinear antiferromagnet, we show that the magnon frequency spectrum exhibits standing spin wave modes and depends on the thickness of Mn$_3$Ge in heterostructure Fe|Au|Mn$_3$Ge. Also, we analyze the switching process of ground state as a function of a spin current. We show a switching phase diagram, which contains switching and non-switching regions. Our work suggests non-collinear antiferromagnets as an efficient platform for terahertz magnonics and ultrafast memory devices.</p>

            <h2>Characteristic oscillations in frequency-resolved heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin systems: Approach from the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Wang, Ruicheng Bao, Naruo Ohga</p>
            <p>Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied by distinctive nonequilibrium features such as negative apparent heat dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we study the frequency decompositions of the heat dissipation in linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We analytically solve Langevin equations with a single linear time-delayed feedback force and calculate the spectrum of the heat dissipation in the frequency domain using the Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR). We find a characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, which asymptotically oscillates sinusoidally with a decaying envelope proportional to the strength of the time-delayed force and the inverse of the frequency. We confirm the generality of the results by extending our analysis to systems with multiple delay times and continuously distributed delay times. Since the violation of FDR is experimentally accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed systems.</p>

            <h2>Revisiting Impurity Induced In-gap Bound States In Unconventional Superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junkang Huang, Z. D. Wang, Tao Zhou</p>
            <p>This study revisits the effects of single impurity scattering in unconventional superconductors, with a specific emphasis on intralayer $d$-wave pairing and interlayer $s$-wave pairing. We reveal that in the context of a square lattice near half-filling doping, there exists an intrinsic connection between the $d$-wave pairing symmetry and the appearance of mid-gap states. This relationship is determined by the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of both the $d$-wave gap amplitude and the square lattice itself. Furthermore, we identify an intrinsic link between the in-gap states and the sign change of the order parameter. In systems with interlayer pairing, strong resonant peaks are observed, despite the absence of sign-reversal characteristics in the pairing order parameter. By utilizing the $T$-matrix approach, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying these impurity-induced states. Our theoretical framework is pertinent to the analysis of newly discovered nickel-based high-temperature superconductors, providing a powerful tool for distinguishing their pairing properties. The results of this study shed light on the complex interplay between pairing symmetries and impurity effects in unconventional superconductors, paving the way for future investigations into the unique properties of these emerging materials.</p>

            <p>While either spin or point-group adaptation is straightforward when considered independently, the standard technique for factoring isotropic spin Hamiltonians by the total spin S and the irreducible representation of the point-group is limited by the complexity of transformations between different coupling-schemes that are related by site-permutations. To overcome these challenges, we apply projection-operators directly to uncoupled basis-states, enabling the simultaneous treatment of spin and point-group symmetry without the need for recoupling-transformations. This provides a simple and efficient approach for the exact diagonalization of isotropic spin-models that we illustrate with applications to Heisenberg spin-rings and polyhedra, including systems that are computationally inaccessible with conventional coupling-techniques.</p>

            <p>Spin coupling between magnetic metal atoms and organic radicals plays a pivotal role in high-performance magnetic materials. The complex interaction involving multi-spin centers in bulk materials makes it challenging to study spin coupling at the atomic scale. Here, we investigate the $d$-$\pi$-$d$ spin interaction in well-defined metal-organic coordinated structures composed of two iron (Fe) atoms and four all-trans retinoic acid (ReA) molecules, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The ReA molecule is turned into a spin-$1/2$ radical state by dehydrogenation, facilitating strong magnetic coupling with the coordinated Fe atoms. Comprehensive theoretical analysis, based on density functional theory and valence bond theory, further elucidates the intrinsic mechanism of ferrimagnetic spin coupling in the coordination structure. Specifically, simultaneous antiferromagnetic coupling of Fe dimer to ReA radicals parallelizes the dimer spin orientation. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of spin interaction in metal-organic coordination structures and provides microscopic insights for designing advanced magnetic materials.</p>

            <p>Waveguides are fundamental components for signal transmission in integrated wave-based processing systems. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with designing magnonic waveguides and propose a novel type with promising properties. Specifically, we study a magnonic waveguide formed within a uniform ferromagnetic layer (Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$) through surface anisotropy applied in stripe regions, creating Bragg mirror structures. The proposed waveguide enables the propagation of high-frequency spin waves with high velocities in the ferromagnetic layer while avoiding static demagnetizing effects. Using finite element simulations, we calculate the dispersion relation of the waveguide modes and analyze their spatial profiles. Additionally, we evaluate the group velocity and localization characteristics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the waveguide's performance.</p>

            <h2>On modeling global grain boundary energy functions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adam Morawiec</p>
            <p>Grain boundaries affect properties of polycrystalline materials. The influence of a boundary is largely determined by its energy. Grain boundary energy is often portrayed as a function of macroscopic boundary parameters representing grain misorientation and boundary plane inclination. In grain boundary simulation and modeling, many studies neglect structural multiplicity of boundaries, i.e., existence of metastable states, and focus on minimum energy. The minimum energy function restricted to constant misorientation should satisfy Herring's condition for interface stability. This requirement has been ignored in recent works on grain boundary energy functions. Example violations of the stability condition are shown. Moreover, a simple and natural procedure for constructing a continuous function satisfying the condition is described. Cusps in the energy as a function of boundary plane inclinations arise because of the imposition of the stability condition, and their locations and shapes result from properties of input data. An example of applying the procedure to simulated data is presented.</p>

            <p>Understanding the formation of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials is a problem of fundamental and technological interest. GdRu2Si2 is one such candidate material which has been shown to host a variety of multi-Q magnetic structures, including in zero-field. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used to measure the spin excitations in the field-polarized phase of GdRu2Si2. Linear spin wave theory and a method of interaction invariant path analysis are used to derive a Hamiltonian accounting for the observed spectra, and comparisons to \textit{ab initio} calculations are made. No evidence for anisotropic or higher order-exchange terms beyond bilinear Heisenberg exchange is found. This is discussed in the context of the multi-Q states existing at lower fields, for which these types of terms have previously been conceived to be significant in the formation of multi-Q ground states.</p>

            <p>Many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) offers a significant speed-up in the simulation of various systems, including soft matter, in comparison with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on Lennard-Jones nteractions, which is crucial for describing phenomena characterized by large time and length scales. Moreover, it has recently been shown that the MARTINI force-field coarse-graining approach is applicable in MDPD, thus rendering feasible the simulation of complex systems as in MD MARTINI for ever larger systems for longer physical times. Here, simulations of various lipid membranes were performed by using the MDPD-MARTINI coarse-grained (CG) force-field, relevant properties were calculated, and comparison with standard MD MARTINI CG simulations and experimental data was made. Thus insights into structural properties of these bilayer systems and further evidence regarding the transferability of the MDPD-MARTINI models are provided. In this regard, this is a natural next step in the development of the general-purpose MDPD-MARTINI CG force-field, which generally provides significant speed-ups in both computational and physical simulated times, in comparison with standard CG MD simulations.</p>

            <p>Diatoms have been described as nanometer-born lithographers because of their ability to create sophisticated three-dimensional amorphous silica exoskeletons. The hierarchical architecture of these structures provides diatoms with mechanical protection and the ability to filter, float, and manipulate light. Therefore, they emerge as an extraordinary model of multifunctional materials from which to draw inspiration. In this paper, we use numerical simulations, analytical models, and experimental tests to unveil the structural and fluid dynamic efficiency of the Coscinodiscus species diatom. Then we propose a novel 3D printable multifunctional biomimetic material for applications such as porous filters, heat exchangers, drug delivery systems, lightweight structures, and robotics. Our results demonstrate the role of Nature as a material designer for efficient and tunable systems and highlight the potential of diatoms for engineering materials innovation. Additionally, the results reported in this paper lay the foundation to extend the structure-property characterization of diatoms.</p>

            <h2>Self-diffusive dynamics of active Brownian particles at moderate densities</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rodrigo Soto</p>
            <p>The Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model has become a prototype of self-propelled particles. ABPs move persistently at a constant speed $V$ along a direction that changes slowly by rotational diffusion, characterized by a coefficient $\Dr$. Persistent motion plus random reorientations generate a random walk at long times with a diffusion coefficient that, for isolated ABPs in two dimensions, is given by $D_0=V^2/(2\Dr)$. Here we study the density effects on the self-diffusive dynamics using a recently proposed kinetic theory for ABPs, in which persistent collisions are described as producing a net displacement on the particles. On intermediate timescales, where many collisions have taken place but the director of the tagged particle has not yet changed, an effective stochastic dynamics emerges, characterized by an effective reduced streaming velocity $V_\text{eff}$ and anisotropic diffusion, with coefficients explicitly depending on density. Based on this result, an effective theoretical and numerical approach is proposed in which the particles follow stochastic dynamics with mean-field interactions based on the local density. Finally, on time scales larger than $\Dr^{-1}$, the tagged particle shows an effective diffusive motion with a coefficient $D=V_\text{eff}^2/(2\Dr)$. The dependence of $V_\text{eff}$ on density indicates that the kinetic theory is limited to are fractions smaller than 0.42, and beyond this limit unphysical results appear.</p>

            <p>The world of nanoscales in fluidics is the frontier where the continuum of fluid mechanics meets the atomic, and even quantum, nature of matter. While water dynamics remains largely classical under extreme confinement, several experiments have recently reported coupling between water transport and the electronic degrees of freedom of the confining materials. This avenue prompts us to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamic flows under the perspective of interacting excitations, akin to condensed matter frameworks. Here we show, using a combination of many-body theory and molecular simulations, that the flow of a liquid can induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating wall, at odds with the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show that the range of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid's electronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are at resonance with the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnelling is expected to play a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidic networks, such as lamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes. It further suggests exploiting the electronic properties of the confining walls for manipulating liquids via their dielectric spectra, beyond the nature and characteristics of individual molecules.</p>

For that purpose, we derive an effective resonant tunneling model where the QD is renormalized with an induced superconducting gap. By applying Keldysh Green's function technique, we compute the local density of states as well as the transmission functions. In the latter case, we observe that the Andreev bound states forming on the QD are inverted if the junction has $p$-wave symmetry, meaning that electron and hole orbitals switch roles. We calculate the thermoelectric transport coefficients both analytically and numerically and show how the induced gaps and the band inversion are reflected in the electrical and heat conductance as well as the Seebeck coefficient, the latter experiencing a sign change in the topological case.</p>

            <p>Launching and focusing phonon-polaritons present novel opportunities for low-loss guiding of subdiffractionally confined light at the nanoscale. Despite significant efforts to improve control in polaritonic media, focused and spatially confined phonon-polariton waves have only been achieved in the in-plane anisotropic crystals (such as MoO$_3$) and remain elusive in the in-plane isotropic crystals (such as hexagonal boron nitride). In this study, we present a previously unexplored approach to launching phonon-polaritons by employing hBN subwavelength resonators coupled to gold nanoantennas. The integration of gold nanoantennas enables efficient coupling to the far-field component of mid-infrared light, while the geometry of the resonators defines the wavefront curvature, spatial confinement, and focusing of the launched polaritons. Using standard lithographic protocols, we achieve strong field enhancement and resonant mode localization, generating phonon-polaritons with precise spatial definition. Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy reveals the real-space optical contrast of these modes. This innovative and practical approach introduces a new paradigm for fabricating nanoresonators that actively launch and focus phonon-polaritons, opening avenues for advanced nanophotonic devices.</p>

            <p>The collective chasing dynamics of non-reciprocally coupled densities leads to stable travelling waves which can be mapped to a model for emergent flocking. In this work, we couple the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model (NRCH) to a fluid to minimally describe scalar active mixtures in a suspension, with the aim to explore the stability of the waves, i.e. the emergent flock in the presence of self-generated fluid flows. We show that the emergent polarity is linearly unstable to perturbations for a specific sign of the active stress recalling instabilities of orientational order in a fluid. Using numerical simulations, we find however that non-reciprocity stabilizes the waves against the linear instability in a large region of the phase space.</p>

            <p>We consider a proximity effect between Dirac surface states of a topological insulator and the skyrmion phase of an insulating magnet. A single skyrmion results in the surface states having a chiral gapless mode confined to the perimeter of the skyrmion. For the lattice of skyrmions, the tunneling coupling between confined states leads to the formation of low energy bands delocalized across the whole system. We show that the structure of these bands can be investigated with the help of the phenomenological chiral network model with a kagome lattice geometry. While the network model by itself can be in a chiral Floquet phase unattainable without external periodic driving, we show how to use a procedure known as band reconstruction to obtain the low energy bands of the electrons on the surface of the topological insulator for which there is no external driving. We conclude that band reconstruction is essential for the broad class of network models recently introduced to describe the electronic properties of different nanostructures.</p>

            <p>We investigate the dynamics of close-contact melting (CCM) on gas-trapped hydrophobic surfaces, with specific focus on the effects of geometrical confinement and the liquid-air meniscus below the liquid film. By employing dual-series and perturbation methods, we obtain numerical solutions for the effective slip lengths associated with velocity $\lambda$ and temperature $\lambda_t$ fields, across various values of aspect ratio $\Lambda$ (defined as the ratio of the film thickness $h$ to the structure's periodic length $l$) and gas-liquid fraction $\phi$. Asymptotic solutions of $\lambda$ and $\lambda_t$ for $\Lambda\ll 1$ and $\Lambda \gg 1$ are derived and summarized for different surface structures, interface shapes and $\Lambda$, which reveal a different trend for $\lambda$ and $\Lambda \ll 1$ and the presence of a meniscus. In the context of constant-pressure CCM, our results indicate that transverse-grooves surfaces consistently reduced the heat transfer. However, longitudinal grooves can enhance heat transfer under the effects of confinement and meniscus when $\Lambda \lessapprox 0.1$ and $\phi < 1 - 0.5^{2/3} \approx 0.37$. For gravity-driven CCM, the parameters of $l$ and $\phi$ determine whether the melting rate is enhanced, reduced, or nearly unaffected. We construct a phase diagram based on the parameter matrix $(\log_{10} l, \phi)$to delineate these three regimes. Lastly, we derived two asymptotic solutions for predicting the variation in time of the unmelted solid height.</p>

            <p>We report on the electron spin resonance (ESR), heat capacity, magnetization, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), magnetic circular and linear dichroism (XMCD, XMLD), as well as the electrical resistivity of EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ single crystals. Antiferromagnetic order of Eu was observed in several quantities at $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}\,=\,18\,\rm K$. The temperature dependencies of ESR linewidth and resonance shift show, when approaching the Eu-ordered state, a divergence towards $T^{\rm Eu}_{\rm N}$, indicating the growing importance of magnetic correlations and the build-up of internal magnetic fields. An additional temperature scale of $\approx 47\,\rm K$ has considerable impact on linewidth, resonance field and intensity. This points to the presence of weak Mn-based ordering. The observed ESR line is interpreted as an Eu$^{2+}$ resonance, which probes the weak magnetic background of the Mn subsystem. Such picture is suggested by the lineshape which keeps to be Lorentzian across the $47\,\rm K$ scale and by the ESR intensity which can be described by the same Curie-Weiss temperature above and below $47\,\rm K$. In the same temperature range anomalies were observed at $48.5\,\rm K$ and $51\,\rm K$ in the heat capacity data as well as a pronounced broadening of the NMR signal of the EuMn$_{2}$P$_{2}$ samples. In XMCD and XMLD measurements, this weak magnetic order could not be detected in the same temperature range which might be due to the small magnetic moment, with a potential $c$-component or frustration.</p>

            <p>The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</p>

            <h2>Sample shape dependence of magnetic noise</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven T. Bramwell</p>
            <p>Zero-field magnetic noise, characterised by the magnetic autocorrelation function $S_s(t)$, has been observed, perhaps surprisingly, to depend on sample shape $s$. The reasons for this are identified and general expressions are derived that relate the autocorrelation functions for systems of different shape to an underlying `intrinsic' form. Assuming the flcutuatiopn-dissipation theorem, it is shown that, for any noise that relaxes monotonically, the effect of sample shape is to reduce both the noise amplitude and mean relaxation time by a factor of $1+N\chi_i$, where $N$ is the demagnetizing factor and $\chi_i$ the intrinsic susceptibility. In frequency space, where $S_s(t)$ Fourier transforms into the power spectrum $S_s(\omega)$, the above two factors combine to suppress the zero frequency amplitude of $S_s(\omega)$ by $(1+N\chi_i)^2$, while at high frequency, sample shape dependence becomes negligible. These results suggest simple and robust experimental tests of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem in magnetic systems that may be useful in distinguishing bulk from surface effects.</p>

            <p>Phonon-assisted photoluminescence (PL) in molybdenum-based two-dimensional dichalcogenides is typically weak due to the dormant phonon coupling with optically inactive momentum-dark (intervalley) excitons, unlike in tungsten-based dichalcogenides where such processes are more prominent. Despite this inefficiency, we revisit excitons in MoS$_2$ using rigorous finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations to identify ways to enhance phonon-assisted recombination channels. Our ab-initio results, complemented by group-theoretic analyses, reveal that while unstrained MoS$_2$ exhibits no phonon-assisted PL emissions at cryogenic temperatures due to forbidden A$^{\prime\prime}$ phonon modes, biaxial strain opens a pathway to significantly intensify this emission by activating hole-phonon A$^{\prime}$-mediated scattering channels. By calculating allowed exciton-phonon matrix elements and scattering rates, we demonstrate how strain redistributes oscillator strengths toward radiative recombination. These findings provide a promising route to improving PL emission efficiency in various metal dichalcogenide monolayers through strain engineering and offer valuable insights for further exploration of exciton-phonon dynamics, including time-resolved spectroscopic studies.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic and Real-time Dynamic Properties of Complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sizheng Cao, Xian-Hui Ge, Yi-Cheng Rui</p>
            <p>We study the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) numerically and investigate thermodynamic behavior of cSYK model across varying chemical potentials. We discover that the cSYK model remarkably mirrors the first-order phase transition seen in the van der Waals-Maxwell system, culminating at a non-mean-field critical point with distinctively different critical exponents. We analyze in detail the similarity between the van der Waals phase transition and the cSYK model, and further explore the mechanism by which the chemical potential drives the phase transition in the system. Exact diagonalization for the cSYK model reveals the significant impact of chemical potential on energy distribution, with observable energy gaps in the gapped phase. Quantum chaos indicators, including spectral form factors, suggest more stable energy states in the neutral case. Real-time dynamics, analyzed via analytical continuation of Schwinger-Dyson equations, show rapid decay in the gapless phase and prolonged oscillation lifetimes in the gapped regime. Spectral functions imply a shift from a continuous to a discrete energy level distribution, emphasizing the critical role of chemical potential in shaping spectral properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Hackl, Mario Kieburg, Joel Maldonado</p>
            <p>Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.</p>

            <h2>On-the-Fly Path Planning of Compositional Gradients in High Dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Samuel Price, Zhaoxi Cao, Ian McCue</p>
            <p>Functional gradients have recently experienced an explosion in activity due to advances in manufacturing, where compositions can now be spatially varied on-the-fly during fabrication. In addition, modern computational thermodynamics has reached sufficient maturity -- with respect to property databases and the availability of commercial software -- that gradients can be designed with specific sets of properties. Despite these successes, there are practical limitations on the calculation speeds of these thermodynamic tools that make it intractable to model every element in an alloy. As a result, most path planning is carried out via surrogate models on simplified systems (e.g., approximating Inconel 718 as Ni$_{59}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$ instead of Ni$_{53}$Cr$_{23}$Fe$_{18}$Nb$_{3}$Mo$_{2}$Ti$_{1}$). In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome using a combination of on-the-fly sampling and a conjectured corollary of the lever rule for transformations of isothermal paths in arbitrary compositional dimensions. We quantitatively benchmark the effectiveness of this new method and find that it can be as much as 106 times more efficient than surrogate modeling.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear topological pumping of edge solitons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinrui You, Liaoyuan Xiao, Yongguan Ke, Chaohong Lee</p>
            <p>We study how nonlinear strength affects topological pumping of edge solitons by using nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For weak nonlinear strength, the introduction of nonlinearity breaks the symmetry of the energy spectrum, which makes the topological pumping from the left edge to the right edges differ from the inverse process. For moderate nonlinear strength, self-crossing structures appear in the spectrum, the right-to-left adiabatic pumping channel is destroyed, and only left-to-right topological pumping can be achieved under slow modulation. As the nonlinear strength further inreases, although left-to-right topological pumping in one pumping cycle also breaks down, we find that a thin soliton which is located in a single left edge can be mixed with the bulk soliton, and hybridized topological pumping of edge and bulk solitons can be realized after multiple pumping cycles. For stronger nonlinear strength, edge solitons are self-trapped and all topological pumping channels are shut down. Our work could trigger further studies of the interplay between nonlinearity and topology.</p>

            <h2>Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kevin T. Grosvenor, Niels A. Obers, Subodh P. Patil</p>
            <p>We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</p>

            <h2>Robust Dynamics of Rogue waves, Breathers and Mixed Bound State Solutions in Spin-Orbit and Rabi Coupled Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P.S.Vinayagam, R.Radha</p>
            <p>In this paper, based on an integrable model governed by four system parameters, namely, spin-orbit coupling and Rabi coupling which are constants while the other two parameters, namely the harmonic trap and scattering lengths which are time dependent, we investigate the spin orbit-Rabi coupled condensates governed by the two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) equation. Employing Darboux transformation approach with nontrivial seed solution, we generate rogue waves, breathers, mixed rogue-dark-bright and classical dark-bright solitons. While the addition of SOC contributes to rapid oscillations in the amplitude of the rogue waves, Rabi coupling results in the appearance of stripes in the temporal direction. When the transient trap is switched on, these stripes which remain stable within the confining region, begin to overlap exponentially in the expulsive domain and eventually shrink leading to instability. We have shown that the instability arising in the rogue waves in a transient trap can be completely overcome by manipulating the scattering length through Feshbach resonance. In the case of breathers, the Rabi coupling introduces temporal stripes with single and double mode peaks around the origin while under the influence of the transient trap, the breathers get compressed and tilted. On the other hand, the amplitude of breathers which stays constant between a maxima and minima despite oscillating with time undergoes rapid fluctuations in a given spatial domain under the influence of SOC. In the case of classical dark-bright solitons, we see the flipping of dark solitons to attain positive density much similar to bright solitons under the impact of Rabi coupling. One also witnesses a 45 degree shift in the trajectory of dark and bright solitons when the transient trap is switched on. The width of the solitons widen in the confining trap while they shrink in the expulsive domain.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wei Li, Yi-Lun Du, Nan Su, Konrad Tywoniuk, Kyle Godbey, Horst Stöcker</p>
            <p>Community detection, also known as graph partitioning, is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in diverse fields such as complex network theory, transportation, and smart power grids. The problem's solution space grows drastically with the number of vertices and subgroups, making efficient algorithms crucial. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising approach to tackling NP-hard problems. This study explores the use of a quantum-inspired algorithm, Simulated Bifurcation (SB), for community detection. Modularity is employed as both the objective function and a metric to evaluate the solutions. The community detection problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling seamless integration with the SB algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that SB effectively identifies community structures in benchmark networks such as Zachary's Karate Club and the IEEE 33-bus system. Remarkably, SB achieved the highest modularity, matching the performance of Fujitsu's Digital Annealer, while surpassing results obtained from two quantum machines, D-Wave and IBM. These findings highlight the potential of Simulated Bifurcation as a powerful tool for solving community detection problems.</p>

            <h2>Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cameron Cook, Carlos Blanco, Juri Smirnov</p>
            <p>Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</p>

            <h2>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David Poland, Gordon Rogelberg</p>
            <p>We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sašo Grozdanov, Alexander Soloviev</p>
            <p>In classical kinetic theory, the BBGKY hierarchy is an infinite chain of integro-differential equations that describes the full time-reversal-invariant (Liouville) system of interacting (quasi)-particles in terms of $N$-particle distribution functions. In this work, instead of truncating the hierarchy at the lowest level, as is done by the Boltzmann equation, we develop a scheme similar to the relaxation time approximation that is in principle able to account for the entire chain of equations. We then explicitly investigate its truncation at the second level of the BBGKY hierarchy and, within this scheme, study the spectra of conserved operator correlation functions in a gas of weakly confined hadrons. We also discuss how these higher levels account for parts of the operator spectra `deeper in the ultra-violet regime' and compare them to known results derived from the holographic duality.</p>

LEPD, the positron counterpart of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), offers higher accuracy in surface structure determination. The station enables acquisition of LEPD I-V curves within a few hours, allowing measurements before surface degradation occurs. It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 °C. The sample holder is compatible with the LEPD station at SPF-A4 and the ARPES station at PF BL-13B, both located at the Tsukuba campus of the Institute of Materials Structure Science (IMSS), KEK.

            <p>Quantum information processing relies on how dynamics unfold in open quantum systems. In this work, we study the non-Markovian dynamics in the single mode spin-boson model at strong couplings. In order to apply perturbation theory, we transform our Hamiltonian to polaron frame, so that the effective system-bath coupling gets reduced. We employ coherence defined by l1-norm to analyze the non-Markovian effects in the spin-boson model. In the transformed frame of reference, the correlation timescales for the bath are significantly shorter than the system's relaxation timescale-a key assumption for Markovian dynamics. However, intriguingly, we demonstrate that under the large polaron theory, the reduced dynamics exhibit effective non-Markovian behaviour within a specific range of couplings, while remaining Markovian beyond this range.</p>

The present work delves into decoherence dynamics of a dressed qubit, represented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites that are strongly coupled to a collective bosonic bath. To simplify calculations under strong coupling, we adopt the Lang-Firsov transformation, effectively minimizing system-bath interactions. Within the polaron perspective using Ohmic bath spectral density with a Gaussian cutoff, we identify a fundamental timescale $s$ (equivalently a length scale $l$), dictating coherence decay. Utilizing a quantum master equation in the energy eigen basis while maintaining fixed particle number, we demonstrate that coherence persists for small $s$ values but diminishes for larger ones. Additionally, we explore the utilization of $\pi$-pulses to manipulate decoherence within the system.</p>

            <p>A general analytical approach to the study of electromagnetic resonances of metasurfaces consisting of meta-atoms with anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities and irradiated with obliquely incident light is developed in the direct dipole-moment representation. The presented approach allows us to clearly trace and explain the features of the electromagnetic coupling between electric and magnetic dipole moments in the metasurface and to identify its role in the formation of optical resonances. For these purposes, the dependence of the dipole lattice sums on the angle of illumination is also presented. Expressions for the transmittance and reflectivity corresponding to the specular reflectance are presented with explicit inclusion of the dipole moments of particles in the array, which allows using these expressions for multipole analysis of purely numerical results concerning the optical response of metasurfaces. The developed analytical method is tested to characterize the spectral resonances of dielectric metasurfaces composed of rectangular silicon nanoprisms. In addition, we discuss the relationship and similarity between the results of coupled dipole and coupled dipole-quadrupole methods. Our analytical representation of electromagnetic dipole coupling is an insightful and fast method for the characterization of collective resonances in metasurfaces under illumination at oblique incidence. It could be especially useful for designing planar nanophotonic devices consisting of arbitrary-shaped building blocks and operating under special irradiation conditions.</p>

We investigate the temperature effects on this doped 1D system under an external constant Zeeman magnetic field $B_0$. We find that $B_0$ suppresses the gapless behavior present for certain values of chemical potential and is able to induce a gapless-gapped phase transition at a critical field strength.

We concentrate on the effect the local vibrations have on the dynamics of this initial state. Our study supplements recent investigations of string breaking, traditionally studied within quantum chromodynamics (QCD), to quantum many-body systems. Two regimes are identified depending on the strength of the coupling with local vibrations. For weak coupling, the string breaking is slowed down as compared to the dynamics in an isolated Ising string. The strong coupling leads to complicated dynamics in which the domain wall character of excitation is dissolved among many coupled states.</p>

Here, using an approach that can be easily generalized across quantum-hardware platforms, we present a case study based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. We model and experimentally verify the effects of phase noise and timing jitter in the control system in conjunction with the spin qubit's environmental noise. We further consider the impact of different phase noise characteristics on the fidelity of dynamical decoupling sequences.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martin James, Francesco Viola, Agnese Seminara</p>
            <p>Marine organisms manipulate their surrounding flow through their swimming dynamics, which affects the transport of their own odor cues. We demonstrate by direct numerical simulations how a group of mesoscale swimmers immersed in a turbulent flow alters the shape of the odor plume they release in the water. Odor mixing is enhanced by increased velocity fluctuations and a swimmer-induced flow circulation which widen the odor plume at close range while speeding up dilution of the chemical trace. Beyond a short-range increase in the likelihood of being detected, swimming considerably reduces detections with effects that can persist at distances of the order of ten times the size of the group or more. We find that puller-like swimmers are more effective at olfactory shielding than pusher-like swimmers. We trace this difference back to the dynamics at the swimmer location, which tends to trap odor at the source for pushers and to dilute it for pullers. Olfactory shielding is robust to changes in the conditions, and is more pronounced for weak turbulent Reynolds numbers and large swimmer Reynolds numbers. Our results suggest that olfactory shielding may play a role in the emergence of different swimming modalities by marine organisms.</p>

            <p>Broken-symmetry (BS) approaches are widely employed to evaluate Heisenberg exchange parameters, primarily in combination with DFT calculations. For many magnetic materials, BS-DFT calculations give reasonable estimations of exchange parameters although systematic failures have also been reported. While the latter were attributed to deficiencies of approximate exchange-correlation functional, we prove here by treating a simple model system that the broken-symmetry methodology has serious problems. Detailed analysis clarifies the intrinsic issue with the broken-symmetry treatment of low-spin states. It shows, in particular, that the error in the BS calculation of exchange parameter scales with the degree of covalency between the magnetic and the bridging orbitals. As a possible tool to overcome this intrinsic drawback of single-determinant BS approaches, we propose their extension to a minimal multiconfigurational version.</p>

To quantify the system noise improvement we perform an ac Stark shift calibration to precisely determine noise power levels on-chip (at each cavity's reference plane) and the total system gain. We then characterize the qubit state measurement fidelity and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To conduct the most faithful measurement of the benefits offered by the KI-TWPA we perform these measurements for readout chains where the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier is the first-stage amplifier (FSA) - with none of the external hardware required to operate the KI-TWPA - and with the KI-TWPA as the FSA. While some readout cavities fall outside the KI-TWPA bandwidth, for those inside the bandwidth we demonstrate a maximum improvement in the state measurement SNR by a factor of 1.45, and increase the fidelity from 96.2% to 97.8%. These measurements demonstrate a system noise below 5 quanta referenced on-chip and we bound the KI-TWPA excess noise to be below 4 quanta for the six cavities inside its bandwidth. These results show a promising path forward for realizing quantum-limited readout chains in large qubit systems using a single parametric amplifier.</p>

            <h2>D-HAT: a Diatom-inspired structure for a Helmet concept Against Trauma</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ludovico Musenich, Lorenzo Strozzi, Massimiliano Avalle, Flavia Libonati</p>
            <p>The primary objective of helmet design continues to be the prevention of traumatic brain injuries. Yet, achieving an optimal user experience, including aspects such as fit, thermal comfort, breathability, waterproofing, and reusability, is increasingly significant. Thus, designing helmets with multifunctional performance represents the latest technological frontier for safety devices. This study draws inspiration from the morphology of Coscinodiscus species diatoms to develop a biomimetic material replicating their cellular structure and multifunctionality. Unlike its biological counterpart, the synthetic material is engineered as the inner liner for multi impact helmets, suited for urban sports and micro mobility applications. The architecture of the material is modeled using computer aided design tools, and its energy absorption capabilities are analyzed through finite element modeling and quasi static compression tests on 3D printed elastomeric samples. Performance optimization is achieved through a parametric approach. The results demonstrate that the material exhibits energy absorption comparable to cellular materials like honeycombs, while offering lightweight properties, breathability, and resistance to atmospheric agents. This biomimetic design marks a significant advancement in high performance safety equipment.</p>

            <h2>Modulational Instability and Dynamical Growth Blockade in the Nonlinear Hatano-Nelson Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stefano Longhi</p>
            <p>The Hatano-Nelson model is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian physics, describing asymmetric hopping dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice, which gives rise to fascinating phenomena such as directional transport, non-Hermitian topology, and the non-Hermitian skin effect. It has been widely studied in both classical and quantum systems, with applications in condensed matter physics, photonics, and cold atomic gases. Recently, nonlinear extensions of the Hatano-Nelson model have opened a new avenue for exploring the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermitian effects. Particularly, in lattices with open boundary conditions, nonlinear skin modes and solitons, localized at the edge or within the bulk of the lattice, have been predicted. In this work, we examine the nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and reveal a novel dynamical phenomenon arising from the modulational instability of nonlinear plane waves: growth blockade. This phenomenon is characterized by the abrupt halt of norm growth, as observed in the linear Hatano-Nelson model, and can be interpreted as a stopping of convective motion arising from self-induced disorder in the lattice.</p>

            <h2>Integrative Learning of Intensity Fluctuations of Quantum Dots under Excitation via a Tailored Mixture Hidden Markov Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Yang, Hawi Nyiera, Yonglei Sun, Jing Zhao, Kun Chen</p>
            <p>Semiconductor nano-crystals, known as quantum dots (QDs), have garnered significant interest in various scientific fields due to their unique fluorescence properties. One captivating characteristic of QDs is their ability to emit photons under continuous excitation. The intensity of photon emission fluctuates during the excitation, and such a fluctuation pattern can vary across different dots even under the same experimental conditions. What adding to the complication is that the processed intensity series are non-Gaussian and truncated due to necessary thresholding and normalization. As such, conventional approaches in the chemistry literature, typified by single-dot analysis of raw intensity data with Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM), cannot meet the many analytical challenges and may fail to capture any novel yet rare fluctuation patterns among QDs. Collaborating with scientists in the chemistry field, we have developed an integrative learning approach to simultaneously analyzing intensity series of multiple QDs. Our approach still inherits the HMM as the skeleton to model the intensity fluctuations of each dot, and based on the data structure and the hypothesized collective behaviors of the QDs, our approach asserts that (i) under each hidden state, the normalized intensity follows a 0/1 inflated Beta distribution, (ii) the state distributions are shared across all the QDs, and (iii) the patterns of transitions can vary across QDs. These unique features allow for a precise characterization of the intensity fluctuation patterns and facilitate the clustering of the QDs. With experimental data collected on 128 QDs, our methods reveal several QD clusters characterized by unique transition patterns across three intensity states. The results provide deeper insight into QD behaviors and their design/application potentials.</p>

            <h2>Constructive impact of Wannier-Stark field on environment-boosted quantum batteries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Animesh Ghosh, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Aditi Sen De</p>
            <p>Using the ground states of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model as the battery's initial state, we demonstrate that using the Wannier-Stark (WS) field for charging in addition to onsite interactions can increase the maximum power of the battery. Although the benefit is not ubiquitous, bosonic batteries are more affected by the WS field than fermionic ones. In particular, there exists a critical WS field strength above which the power gets increased in the battery. Further, we determine a closed form expression of the stored work when the battery is in the ground state of the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard model with only hopping term and the charging is carried out with onsite interactions and WS field irrespective of lattice-size of the battery. Moreover, we exhibit that it is possible to extract work in the fermionic batteries even without charging when the edge sites are attached to two local thermal baths having high temperatures -- this process we refer to as {\it environment-assisted ergotropy}. Note, however, that the bosonic batteries are able to exhibit such an environmental benefit in the transient regime when the lattice-size is increased and when Wannier-Stark field is present. Nonetheless, if the onsite interaction or WS potential with a critical strength is utilized as a charger, energy can be stored and extracted from both bosonic and fermionic batteries in the presence of the thermal baths.</p>

            <p>We develop a theoretical model for a tunable coherent terahertz radiation source based on the long-lived Bose condensate of photons. In the device we propose, the original photon pumping is performed incoherently by a blackbody radiation emitter. The photons thus produced Bose-condense by the inelastic relaxation on a two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetostatic field. The process involves neither population inversion nor light wave amplification the standard laser sources are built on. The coherence and tunability of the light emitted by such a photon condensate are provided and supported by the discrete spectrum of the electron gas in the quantizing magnetic field. The device is a compact-size semiconductor crystal. We propose the design and perform the realistic calculations of the physical properties and limiting factors for the terahertz photon Bose-condensate resonator. We show that our terahertz source can deliver the highly coherent light emission in the frequency range of 3-30 THz for the magnetic field induction of the order of 2 T, with the upper emission frequency limit adjustable by the strength of the magnetic field applied.</p>

            <p>The emergence of a quantum spin liquid (QSL), a state of matter that can result when electron spins are highly correlated but do not become ordered, has been the subject of a considerable body of research in condensed matter physics. Spin liquid states have been proposed as hosts for high-temperature superconductivity and can host topological properties with potential applications in quantum information science. The excitations of most quantum spin liquids are not conventional spin waves but rather quasiparticles known as spinons, whose existence is well established experimentally only in one-dimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL behavior in higher dimensions remains challenging. Here, we investigate the novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective spin-1/2 moments with no detectable inherent chemical disorder. Thermodynamic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements performed on high-quality single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.06 K, demonstrate a quadratic power law for the specific heat and reveal a continuum of magnetic excitations in parts of the Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and inelastic neutron scattering spectra suggest that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with spinon excitations concentrated at certain points in the Brillouin zone. We advanced these results by performing additional specific heat measurements under finite fields, further confirming the theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular lattice of YbZn2GaO5.</p>

            <h2>Evolution of entanglement entropy at SU($N$) deconfined quantum critical points</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Menghan Song, Jiarui Zhao, Meng Cheng, Cenke Xu, Michael M. Scherer, Lukas Janssen, Zi Yang Meng</p>
            <p>Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between Néel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</p>

By applying simultaneous microwave bursts to different gate electrodes, we observe multichromatic resonance lines and resonance anticrossings that are caused by the ac Stark shift.

            <p>We study the breakdown of Anderson localization in the one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain, a prototypical example of a disordered classical many-body system. A series of numerical works indicate that an initially localized wave packet spreads polynomially in time, while analytical studies rather suggest a much slower spreading. Here, we focus on the decorrelation time in equilibrium. On the one hand, we provide a mathematical theorem establishing that this time is larger than any inverse power law in the effective anharmonicity parameter $\lambda$, and on the other hand our numerics show that it follows a power law for a broad range of values of $\lambda$. This numerical behavior is fully consistent with the power law observed numerically in spreading experiments, and we conclude that the state-of-the-art numerics may well be unable to capture the long-time behavior of such classical disordered systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasha Gindikin, Alex Kamenev</p>
            <p>We present a bunch of novel phenomena stemming from the pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI), which does not rely on structure inversion asymmetry but instead arises from Coulomb fields of interacting electrons in materials with a strong Rashba effect. First, PSOI can induce $p-$wave superconducting order without the need for any mediators of attraction. Depending on the sign and strength of the PSOI coupling, two distinct superconducting phases emerge in 3D systems, analogous to the A and B phases observed in superfluid $^3\mathrm{He}$. In contrast, 2D systems exhibit $p^x\pm i p^y$ order parameter, leading to the time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity. Second, a sufficiently strong PSOI can induce ferromagnetic ordering. It is associated with a deformation of the Fermi surface, which eventually leads to a Lifshitz transition from a spherical to a toroidal Fermi surface, with a number of experimentally observable signatures. Finally, in sufficiently clean Rashba materials, ferromagnetism and $p-$wave superconductivity may coexist. This state resembles the $\mathrm{A}_1$ phase of $^3\mathrm{He}$, yet it may avoid nodal points due to the toroidal shape of the Fermi surface.</p>

            <p>The parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov (N-U) method is employed in conjunction with a generalized fractional derivative (GFD) to investigate the energy eigenvalues and the total normalized wave function associated with the Coulomb plus screened exponential hyperbolic potential (CPSEHP) in terms of Jacobi polynomials. This potential exhibits maximum effectiveness at lower values of the screening parameter. To explore the thermal and superstatistical characteristics, the derived energy eigenvalues are directly incorporated into the partition function (Z) and subsequently used to determine other thermodynamic quantities, including vibrational mean energy (U), specific heat capacity (C), entropy (S), and free energy (F). Comparisons with previous studies are conducted. The classical case is recovered from the fractional case by setting alpha = beta = 1, consistent with prior work. Our results demonstrate that the fractional parameter plays a crucial role in governing the thermal and superstatistical properties within the framework of this model.</p>

            <h2>Derivation of an effective plate theory for parallelogram origami from bar and hinge elasticity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hu Xu, Ian Tobasco, Paul Plucinsky</p>
            <p>Periodic origami patterns made with repeating unit cells of creases and panels bend and twist in complex ways. In principle, such soft modes of deformation admit a simplified asymptotic description in the limit of a large number of cells. Starting from a bar and hinge model for the elastic energy of a generic four parallelogram panel origami pattern, we derive a complete set of geometric compatibility conditions identifying the pattern's soft modes in this limit. The compatibility equations form a system of partial differential equations constraining the actuation of the origami's creases (a scalar angle field) and the relative rotations of its unit cells (a pair of skew tensor fields). We show that every solution of the compatibility equations is the limit of a sequence of soft modes -- origami deformations with finite bending energy and negligible stretching. Using these sequences, we derive a plate-like theory for parallelogram origami patterns with an explicit coarse-grained quadratic energy depending on the gradient of the crease-actuation and the relative rotations of the cells. Finally, we illustrate our theory in the context of two well-known origami designs: the Miura and Eggbox patterns. Though these patterns are distinguished in their anticlastic and synclastic bending responses, they show a universal twisting response. General soft modes captured by our theory involve a rich nonlinear interplay between actuation, bending and twisting, determined by the underlying crease geometry.</p>

            <h2>Hund's Rule, Interorbital Hybridization, and High-$T_c$ Superconductivity in the Bilayer Nickelate</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xing-Zhou Qu, Dai-Wei Qu, Xin-Wei Yi, Wei Li, Gang Su</p>
            <p>Understanding the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelate superconductors constitutes a fascinating quest. Using density matrix renormalization group for $T=0$ and thermal tensor networks for $T>0$ properties, along with density functional theory calculations, we investigate the intriguing interplay between the Hund's rule coupling and interorbital hybridization that explains the pressure-dependent high-$T_c$ superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. By studying a two-orbital model, we identify three distinct superconductive (SC) regimes: hybridization dominant, Hund's rule dominant, and the hybrid-Hund synergistic SC regimes. In these SC regimes, both $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit algebraic pairing correlations with similar Luttinger parameters $K_{\rm SC}$. In particular, the former always exhibits a much stronger amplitude than the latter, with a distinctly higher SC characteristic temperature $T_c^*$. Below this temperature, the pairing susceptibility diverges as $\chi_{\rm SC}(T) \sim 1/T^{2-K_{\rm SC}}$. With realistic model parameters, we find the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ falls into the Hund's rule dominated SC regime. As hybridization further enhances under pressure, it leads to significant interorbital frustration and in turn suppresses the SC correlations, explaining the rise and fall of high-$T_c$ superconductivity under high pressure [J. Li, et al., arXiv:2404.11369 (2024)]. Our results offer a comprehensive understanding of the interlayer pairing in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</p>

We obtain analytical results for the lattice displacements and corresponding pseudo gauge fields, as a function of twist angle. We benchmark our results for twisted bilayer graphene and twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Our \textit{single-parameter} theory is valid in graphene bilayers for twist angles $\theta ~\gtrsim 0.7^\circ$, and in twisted WSe$_2$ for $\theta ~\gtrsim 1.6^\circ$. We also investigate how relaxation alters the electronic structure in twisted bilayer graphene, providing a simple extension to the continuum model to account for lattice relaxation.</p>

            <p>The interplay of electronic interactions and frustration in crystalline systems leads to a panoply of correlated phases, including exotic Mott insulators with non-trivial patterns of entanglement. Disorder introduces additional quantum interference effects that can drive localization phenomena. Quasicrystals, which are neither disordered nor perfectly crystalline, are interesting playgrounds for studying the effects of interaction, frustration, and quantum interference. Here we consider a solvable example of a quantum spin liquid on a tri-coordinated quasicrystal. We extend Kitaev's original construction for the spin model to our quasicrystalline setting and perform a large scale flux-sampling to find the ground-state configuration in terms of the emergent majorana fermions and flux excitations. This reveals a fully gapped and time-reversal symmetric quantum spin liquid, regardless of the exchange anisotropies, accompanied by a tendency towards non-trivial (de-)localization at the edge and the bulk. The advent of moiré materials and a variety of quantum simulators provide a new platform to bring phases of quasicrystalline quantum matter to life in a controlled fashion.</p>

Incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local unidirectional nanostructure are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As topological materials with symmetry protected Dirac or Weyl fermions are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such an ELC phase are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) - orthorhombic structural transition. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, topology and electron correlation.</p>

It therefore enables a systematic framework for computing the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and dielectric constant. This construction guarantees a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in a low-energy description of an infinite quantum system.

            <p>Over the past two decades, graphene has been intensively studied because of its remarkable mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. Initial studies were enabled by manual ``Scotch Tape'' exfoliation; nearly two decades later, this method is still widely used to obtain chemically-pristine flakes of graphene and other 2D van der Waals materials. Unfortunately, the yield of large, pristine flakes with uniform thickness is inconsistent. Thus, significant time and effort are required to exfoliate and locate flakes suitable for fabricating multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we describe a relatively affordable tabletop device (the ``eXfoliator'') that can reproducibly control key parameters and largely automate the exfoliation process. In a typical exfoliation run, the eXfoliator produces 3 or more large ($\ge400\ \mu$m$^2$) high-quality graphene monolayer flakes, allowing new users to produce such flakes at a rate comparable to manual exfoliation by an experienced user. We use an automated mapping system and a computer vision algorithm to locate candidate flakes. Our results provide a starting point for future research efforts to more precisely identify which parameters matter for the success of exfoliation, and to optimize them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Feng Song, Youjin Deng, Yuan-Yao He</p>
            <p>The Hubbard model at temperatures above the Néel transition, despite being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover regime, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the Fermi liquid for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the location of the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methodology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can also serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.</p>

            <p>Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear response theory of molecular machines</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michalis Chatzittofi, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo, Ramin Golestanian</p>
            <p>Chemical affinities are responsible for driving active matter systems out of equilibrium. At the nano-scale, molecular machines interact with the surrounding environment and are subjected to external forces. The mechano-chemical coupling which arises naturally in these systems reveals a complex interplay between chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom with strong impact on their active mechanism. By considering various models far from equilibrium, we show that the tuning of applied forces give rise to a nonlinear response that causes a non-monotonic behaviour in the machines' activity. Our findings have implications in understanding, designing, and triggering such processes by controlled application of external fields, including the collective dynamics of larger non-equilibrium systems where the total dissipation and performance might be affected by internal and inter-particle interactions.</p>

            <h2>Generating Lattice Non-invertible Symmetries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weiguang Cao, Linhao Li, Masahito Yamazaki</p>
            <p>Lattice non-invertible symmetries have rich fusion structures and play important roles in understanding various exotic topological phases. In this paper, we explore methods to generate new lattice non-invertible transformations/symmetries from a given non-invertible seed transformation/symmetry. The new lattice non-invertible symmetry is constructed by composing the seed transformations on different sites or sandwiching a unitary transformation between the transformations on the same sites. In addition to known non-invertible symmetries with fusion algebras of Tambara-Yamagami $\mathbb Z_N\times\mathbb Z_N$ type, we obtain a new non-invertible symmetry in models with $\mathbb Z_N$ dipole symmetries. We name the latter the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry because it arises from gauging the dipole symmetry. We further study the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry in depth, including its topological defect, its anomaly and its associated generalized Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</p>

            <h2>Spinless topological chirality from Umklapp scattering in twisted 3D structures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cong Chen, Xu-Tao Zeng, Wang Yao</p>
            <p>Spinless systems exhibit unique topological characteristics compared to spinful ones, stemming from their distinct algebra. Without chiral interactions typically linked to spin, an intriguing yet unexplored interplay between topological and structural chirality may be anticipated. Here we discover spinless topological chiralities solely from structural chiralities that lie in the 3D spatial patterning of structureless units, exemplified using two types of twisted graphite systems. In a 3D screw twisted structure without periodicity in all directions, we find a chiral Weyl semimetal phase where bulk topology and chiral surface states are both determined by the screw direction. And in a 3D periodic structure formed with layer-alternating twist angle signs, a higher-order Dirac semimetal with chiral hinge states is discovered. Underlying these novel topological states is the intervalley Umklapp scattering that captures the chirality of the twisted interfaces, leading effectively to a sign-flipped chiral interlayer hopping, thereby introducing $\pi$-flux Z2 lattice gauge field that alters the symmetry algebra. Our findings point to a new pathway for engineering topological chirality through patterning twisted arrays of featureless units, which can expand the design principles for topological photonics and acoustics.</p>

            <p>We present the first detailed study of the effect of a strong magnetic field on single-electron pumping in a device utilising a finger-gate split-gate configuration. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate electron pumping from Landau levels in the leads, where the measurements exhibit pronounced oscillations in the lengths of the pumping plateaus with the magnetic field, reminiscent of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This similarity indicates that the pumping process is dependent on the density of states of the 2D electron gas over a narrow energy window. Based on these observations, we develop a new theoretical description of the operation of single-electron pumps which for the first time allows for the determination of the physical parameters of the experiment; such as the capture energy of the electrons, the broadening of the quantised Landau levels in the leads, and the quantum lifetime of the electrons.</p>

            <h2>Coulomb drag by motion of a monolayer polar crystal through graphene nanoconstriction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. L. Chudnovskiy</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict that the motion of a polar crystalline layer between two graphene planes exerts Coulomb drag on electrons in graphene, inducing a DC drag current. The physical mechanism underlying this drag arises from intervalley scattering of charge carriers in graphene caused by the time-dependent potential of the moving crystalline layer. This drag effect manifests above a finite threshold doping of the graphene layers, which is determined by the lattice structure and the relative orientation of the crystalline layer with respect to the graphene lattice. Additionally, the drag current exhibits a nonlinear Hall effect due to the interplay between the induced nonequilibrium pseudospin and the intrinsic pseudospin-orbit coupling in graphene. In turn, the drag exerted on electrons in graphene produces a backaction on the crystalline layer, which can be described as an increase in its dynamic viscosity.</p>

We propose a unified approach, enabling to simultaneously address both the effective dynamics and non-equilibrium phononic state, depending on the position of a punctual sensing (and heating) probe at the surface of the mechanical device. We present an analytical solution in terms of green functions for a unidimensional resonator whose thermomechanical deformation profile generally follows that of the mechanical losses. In particular, we find that both the dynamics and the mechanical fluctuations strongly depend on the loss distribution. The effect of the quantum fluctuations of the heat source is also discussed. Our approach provides the first steps towards a thorough, general platform for analyzing thermal back-action effects and their consequences, which may be of significance for future development in ultrasensitive nanomechanical research.</p>

            <p>We propose a new scheme for the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) Cooper pairing states within ultraflat bands. Central to our approach is the concept of "quantum geometric discrepancy" (QGD), which characterizes the discrepancy in the quantum geometry of paired electrons, giving rise to the flat-band FFLO instability. Remarkably, we find that this instability is directly related to a new quantum geometric quantity we term "anomalous quantum distance", which formally captures QGD. To model both QGD and the anomalous quantum distance, we examine a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with tunable spin-dependent quantum metrics. Utilizing the band-projection method, we analyze the QGD-induced FFLO instability from pair susceptibility near the superconducting critical temperature. Furthermore, we perform self-consistent mean-field calculations to obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition driven by QGD, which aligns well with our analytical results. We emphasize that QGD serves as a distinctive protocol for stabilizing the flat-band FFLO phase.</p>

            <h2>Topological phase transitions in perovskite superlattices driven by temperature, electric field, and doping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiyuan Yang, Shi Liu</p>
            <p>Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases. In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Flavio Noronha, Askery Canabarro, Rafael Chaves, Rodrigo G. Pereira</p>
            <p>Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.</p>

            <h2>Spatiotemporal Patterns in Active Four-State Potts Models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroshi Noguchi</p>
            <p>Many types of spatiotemporal patterns have been observed under nonequilibrium conditions. Cycling through four or more states can provide specific dynamics, such as the spatial coexistence of multiple phases. However, transient dynamics have only been studied by previous theoretical models, since absorbing transition into a uniform phase covered by a single state occurs in the long-time limit. Here, we reported steady long-term dynamics using cyclic Potts models, wherein nucleation and growth play essential roles. Under the cyclic symmetry of the four states, the cyclic changes in the dominant phases and the spatial coexistence of the four phases are obtained at low and high flipping energies, respectively. Under asymmetric conditions, the spatial coexistence of two diagonal phases appears in addition to non-cyclic one-phase modes. The circular domains of the diagonal state are formed by the nucleation of other states, and they slowly shrink to reduce the domain boundary. When three-state cycling is added, competition between the two cycling modes changes the spatiotemporal patterns.</p>

We find a magnetically-tuned metal-to-insulator transition in which the transverse resistance of the nanowire array increases by up to four orders of magnitude. To explain this behavior, we develop a minimal model of a coupled two-wire system which agrees well with observed phenomena. These nanowire arrays can serve as a model systems to understand the origin of exotic behavior in correlated materials via analog quantum simulation.</p>

            <p>We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the single-particle sector exhibits chaotic dynamics. We study the corresponding many-body spectral statistics and show that the spectral form factor (SFF) can be computed \textit{exactly}. Due to the absence of interactions the SFF grows exponentially in time, a result which we demonstrate through simple arguments, scaling collapses, and closed-form evaluation of the SFF. We study the role of interactions by numerically analyzing a kicked Ising model and find that the SFF crosses over to a linear growth regime consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</p>

            <p>The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed \textit{exactly}. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ and integer time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF at integer times to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</p>

            <p>Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>We investigate the effect of orbital current arising from orbital Hall effect in thin films of Nb and Ti in ohmic contact with ferromagnetic Ni in the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltages in response to an a.c. current applied to the bilayer structures. Our experiments were analogous to those on Heavy Metal-Ferromagnet bilayers and we extract the Orbital Hall Torque efficiency and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.</p>

            <p>Complex ferromagnetic oxides such as La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) offer pathways for creating energy efficient spintronic devices with new functionalities. LSMO exhibits high-temperature ferromagnetism, half metallicity, sharp resonance linewidth, low damping and a large anisotropic magnetoresistance response. Combined with Pt, a proven material with high spin-charge conversion efficiency, LSMO can be used to create robust nano-oscillators for neuromorphic computing. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and device level spin-pumping FMR measurements are performed to investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin transport in NdGaO3(110)/LSMO(15 nm)/Pt(0 and 5 nm) thin films ranging from 300K to 90K and compare the device performance with Py(7 nm)/Pt(5 nm) sample. The spin current pumped into Pt is quantified to determine the temperature dependent influence of interfacial interactions. The generated spin current in the micro-device is maximum at 170K for the optimally grown LSMO/Pt films. Additionally, this bilayer system exhibits low magnetic Gilbert damping (0.002), small linewidth (12 Oe) and a large spin Hall angle ($\approx$ 3.2%) at 170K. By fine-tuning the LSMO/Pt interface quality and integrating it into the device structure, the system exhibits a fourfold enhancement in signal output for LSMO/Pt devices compared to the Pt/Py system. Such robust device level performance can pave way for energy-efficient spintronic based devices.</p>

            <p>We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chockalingam Senthilnathan</p>
            <p>A series of recent papers have modified the classical variational phase-field fracture models to successfully predict both the nucleation and propagation of cracks in brittle fracture under general loading conditions. This is done through the introduction of a consistent crack nucleation driving force in the phase field governing equations, which results in the model being able to capture both the strength surface and fracture toughness of the material. This driving force has been presented in the literature for the case of Drucker-Prager strength surface and specific choice of stress states on the strength surface that are captured exactly for finite values of the phase field regularization length parameter $\varepsilon$. Here we present an explicit analytical expression for this driving force given a general material strength surface when the functional form of the strength locus is linear in the material parameter coefficients. In the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, the formulation reproduces the exact material strength surface and for finite $\varepsilon$ the strength surface is captured at any n 'distinct' points on the strength surface where n is the minimum number of material coefficients required to describe it. The presentation of the driving force in the current work facilitates the easy demonstration of its consistent nature. Further, in the equation governing crack nucleation, the toughness in the classical models is shown to be replaced by an effective toughness in the modified theory, that is dependent on the stress. The derived analytical expressions are verified via application to the widely employed Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces.</p>

            <p>A famous paper [Am. J. Phys. 43, 22 (1975)] unveiled the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, now commonly referred to as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) engine, pioneering finite-time thermodynamics. Historically, despite the significance of the CA engine, similar findings had emerged at an earlier time, such as the Yvon engine proposed by J. Yvon in 1955 sharing the exact same EMP. However, the special setup of the Yvon engine has circumscribed its broader influence. This paper extends the Yvon engine model to achieve a level of generality comparable to that of the CA engine. A rigorous comparison reveals that the extended Yvon engine and CA engine represent the steady-state and cyclic forms of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, respectively, and are equivalent. Our work provides a pedagogical example for the teaching of thermodynamics and engineering thermodynamics, given that the simple and lucid derivation of the extended Yvon engine helps students initiate their understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.</p>

            <h2>Heavy Hole vs. Light Hole Spin Qubits: A Strain-Driven Study of SiGe/Ge and GeSn/Ge</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kelvin Dsouza, Patrick Del Vecchio, Nicolas Rotaru, Oussama Moutanabbir, Daryoosh Vashaee</p>
            <p>This work investigates and compares the impact of strain on heavy hole (HH) spin qubits in SiGe/Ge and light hole (LH) spin qubits in GeSn/Ge heterostructures, focusing on energy states, g-factor, Rabi frequency, spin relaxation, and dephasing times. By exploring the distinct properties of HH and LH spin qubits under strain, we demonstrate how strain serves as a tunable parameter to optimize qubit performance. The study highlights that LH spin qubits in Ge quantum dots exhibit lower relaxation rates and higher Rabi frequencies, offering significant advantages for addressing current challenges in gate-defined spin qubits. A significant difference is observed in the g-factor anisotropy, where for HHs the out-of-plane g-factor is larger than the in-plane g-factor, whereas for LHs, the in-plane g-factor dominates both in GeSn/Ge and SiGe/Ge quantum dots. This comparative analysis provides a deeper understanding of HH and LH spin dynamics, advancing the development of scalable quantum technologies based on strained Ge systems.</p>

            <h2>Robust altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnetism in MnPX$_3$-based (X = S or Se) heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yunsong Liu, Yanlong Liu, Xuefei Wang, Nan Xia, Guifang Xu, Yi Wang, Haifeng Wang, Weiwei Gao, Jijun Zhao</p>
            <p>The recent research interests in the non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic band structures have led to the exploration of altermagnets and other compensated magnets. Here, we show that various types of non-relativistic spin splitting can be robustly induced by constructing Van der Waals heterostructures consisting of materials with intra-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders and suitable substrates. Using MnPX$_3$ (X = S or Se) as an example, which has a Néel magnetic order, we demonstrate that altermagnetic spin splitting can arise in the AA-stacking MnPX$_3$/MPX$_3$ (M = Cd, Mg, or Zn) heterostructures. For the AB-stacking heterostructures that are semiconducting, ferrimagnetic-type spin splitting emerges, and the fully compensated magnetization is protected by the Luttinger theorem. By combining with a Van der Waals ferroelectric substrate like CuInP$_2$S$_6$, MnPX$_3$-based heterostructures can show tunable spin splitting and spin-related properties that depend on the electronic band structures and ferroelectric polarization, which can be non-volatilely reversed by applying an out-of-plane electric field. Our study provides a route to induce tunable non-relativistic spin splitting in experimentally synthesizable two-dimensional magnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christopher Gutiérrez, Asari G. Prado</p>
            <p>We present PyAtoms, an interactive open-source software that quickly and easily simulates atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, moiré systems, and superlattices. Rooted in a Fourier-space description of ideal atomic lattice images, PyAtoms is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) with robust capabilities for tuning lattice parameters (lattice constants, strain, number of layers, twist angles) and STM imaging parameters (pixels, scan size, scan angle) and provides time estimates for spectroscopic measurements. These capabilities allow users to efficiently plan time-consuming STM experiments. We provide an overview of PyAtoms' current features, describe its underlying mathematical principles, and then demonstrate simulations of several 2D materials including graphene with variable sub-lattice asymmetry, twisted tri-layer graphene moiré systems, and charge- and bond-density wave systems (2$H$-NbSe$_2$, 1$T$-TaS$_2$, Kekulé-distorted graphene, K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$). Finally, we show that PyAtoms can be used as a useful educational tool in entry- and senior-level physics courses.</p>

            <p>Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is of paramount importance for progress in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should be offering deep insights into these systems at the electronic level, but are limited in their efficacy by their steep computational cost. In this work, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably converge to the `gold standard' accuracy in quantum chemistry for application to extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multiscale resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms in size. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving a validating handshake between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a new benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references, and well inside the scatter of traditional density functional material modeling approaches. This pushes the state of the art for simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, and marks progress into a post-density functional era for more reliable and improvable approaches to first-principles modeling of surface problems at an unprecedented scale and accuracy using ab-initio quantum many-body methods.</p>

            <h2>Discovery of an Ultra-Stable Antiferromagnetic Two-Dimensional CrF3 Phase with Anisotropic Quasi-1D Mechanical, Electronic, and Thermal Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xin Chen, Fengyi Zhou, Yan Suo, Cheng Shao, Xu Cheng, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal</p>
            <p>We report the discovery of an ultra-stable antiferromagnetic two-dimensional (2D) CrF3 phase that is energetically more favorable than the traditionally assumed hexagonal structure. Using first-principles calculations and evolutionary structure searches, we identify a new low-energy rectangular configuration of CrF3 with remarkable anisotropic properties. Mechanically, this phase exhibits zero in-plane Poisson's ratio, a rare negative out-of-plane Poisson's ratio, and quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) behavior characterized by minimal coupling between orthogonal directions. Electronically, CrF3 shows quasi-1D transport with two independent conduction bands near the Fermi level, tunable via uniaxial strain. The calculated bandgap is 3.05 eV, which can be modulated under strain, enabling control over its electronic properties. The material also displays out-of-plane antiferromagnetic ordering with a magnetic anisotropy energy of 0.098 meV per Cr atom and an estimated Neel temperature of 20 K. Additionally, we investigate the thermal conductivity of monolayer rectangular CrF3 (r-CrF3), revealing significant anisotropy in heat transport. The thermal conductivity along the y-axis is approximately 60.5 W/mK at 300 K, much higher than along the x-axis at 13.2 W/mK. The thermal anisotropic factor is 4.58, surpassing that of other 2D materials like black phosphorene, WTe2, and arsenene, highlighting r-CrF3's potential for advanced directional heat management. Consequently, the rectangular CrF3 phase is a promising candidate for applications in spintronics, strain-engineered nanoelectronics, mechanical metamaterials, and thermal management technologies.</p>

            <p>Non-chiral liquid crystals (LCs) exhibiting ferroelectricity, distinguished by their dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli and high spontaneous polarization, provide renewed impetus for research into this area of soft matter and open novel application possibilities. Consequently, identifying structural elements within LC compounds that promote ferroelectricity in non-chiral systems is of critical importance. In this work, two homologs of rod-like compounds, with phenyl and ester groups in the rigid core substituted by fluorine atoms, differing by a single methylene unit, were synthesized and comprehensively analyzed using complementary experimental techniques and quantum-mechanical modeling. This systematic study presents the first documented instance in which such a minimal structural modification markedly influences the polarity of smectic phases in two homologs, without substantially altering phase transition temperatures, particularly the sequence and temperature ranges of smectic and nematic phases. Additionally, findings reveal that the longer homolog, which exhibits paraelectric phases, demonstrates a pronounced capacity to maintain ferroelectric phases in mixtures. These results provide new insights into the critical structure-property relationships between molecular architecture and ferroelectric characteristics in LCs, facilitating the targeted design of non-chiral compounds with polar phases. Moreover, the properties of the studied mixtures underscore the potential to develop multicomponent LC mixtures with stable ferroelectric properties in a broad temperature range, a feature of considerable significance for practical applications.</p>

            <h2>Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sumit Bhattacharjee, Elena Litvinova</p>
            <p>A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianxiang Peng, Liang Wang</p>
            <p>The wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys is very poor due to their inherent low hardness and poor tribological properties. Improving the wear resistance of magnesium and its alloys plays a significant role in expanding their application range. Various surface treatments have been used to produce protective coatings or layers for solving this problem. In this work, the Mg(OH)$_2$ layer with a thickness about 25 microns was directly formed on AZ91 magnesium alloy by oxidizing in superheated water vapor. SEM and XRD were employed to characterize the microstructure and phase composition of oxidized layer. The effect of oxidized layer on the friction and wear properties of magnesium alloy against the bearing steel ball were evaluated by using a reciprocating friction and wear test apparatus. The results showed that layer exhibited low friction coefficients and extremely small wear loss compared to the untreated substrate.

            <p>Vacancy-cluster color centers in lithium fluoride have been studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally for over a century, giving rise to various applications in solid-state lasers, broadband photonic devices, and radiation dosimeters. These color centers are also attractive candidate platforms for applications in quantum information science, due to their spin properties and strong coupling to the crystal lattice, which allows their properties to be easily tuned. Here we present hybrid functional calculations of common vacancy defects in lithium fluoride, including their energetic, spin, and optical properties. We show that for a wide range of hybrid functional parameters tuned to match the experimental band gap, certain defects have little variation in their predicted optical properties. We further demonstrate that the parameters needed to satisfy the generalized Koopman's theorem and correctly position defect levels within the gap, can vary dramatically, even for different charge states of the same defect. Our work establishes the accuracy of the computationally lightweight hybrid-functional approach for predicting the optical and energetic properties of color centers in polar materials.</p>

            <h2>Connecting NTK and NNGP: A Unified Theoretical Framework for Wide Neural Network Learning Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yehonatan Avidan, Qianyi Li, Haim Sompolinsky</p>
            <p>Artificial neural networks have revolutionized machine learning in recent years, but a complete theoretical framework for their learning process is still lacking. Substantial advances were achieved for wide networks, within two disparate theoretical frameworks: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which assumes linearized gradient descent dynamics, and the Bayesian Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP). We unify these two theories using gradient descent learning with an additional noise in an ensemble of wide deep networks. We construct an analytical theory for the network input-output function and introduce a new time-dependent Neural Dynamical Kernel (NDK) from which both NTK and NNGP kernels are derived. We identify two learning phases: a gradient-driven learning phase, dominated by loss minimization, in which the time scale is governed by the initialization variance. It is followed by a slow diffusive learning stage, where the parameters sample the solution space, with a time constant decided by the noise and the Bayesian prior variance. The two variance parameters strongly affect the performance in the two regimes, especially in sigmoidal neurons. In contrast to the exponential convergence of the mean predictor in the initial phase, the convergence to the equilibrium is more complex and may behave nonmonotonically. By characterizing the diffusive phase, our work sheds light on representational drift in the brain, explaining how neural activity changes continuously without degrading performance, either by ongoing gradient signals that synchronize the drifts of different synapses or by architectural biases that generate task-relevant information that is robust against the drift process. This work closes the gap between the NTK and NNGP theories, providing a comprehensive framework for the learning process of deep wide neural networks and for analyzing dynamics in biological circuits.</p>

            <p>We formulate a quantum phase space for molecular rotational and nuclear-spin states. Taking in molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, we reproduce a molecule's admissible angular momentum states known from spectroscopy, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how the state space of a molecular species is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify molecular species whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed.</p>

            <h2>Delayed phosphate release can highly improve energy efficiency of muscle contraction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiaxiang Xu, Jiangke Tao, Bin Chen</p>
            <p>Although the power stroke of myosin and the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) are pivotal in the conversion of ATP's chemical energy into mechanical work occurring in various biological processes, the precise sequence of these two events remains a subject of heated debate due to the involved tiny spatiotemporal scale. Here, we take a different path and choose to investigate how Pi-release that is not directly coupled with the power stroke affects muscle contraction in silico. Utilizing a mechanics model developed for the structural unit of muscle that systematically integrates the chemomechanical cycle of individual myosins, we find that relatively slow Pi-release can markedly improve energy efficiency during muscle contraction. Our model's predictions are largely consistent with experimental data and our analysis suggests that a gradual Pi-release may offer a route to finely adjust the stability of a working myosin on the actin filament, thereby indirectly modulating the power stroke to influence muscle performance. We believe that this work can provide important insights into the kinetics and the function of Pi-release in the regulation of forces and motions generated by myosins for cellular processes.</p>

            <p>We show that the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) from a quantum many-body system is constrained by local athermality of an initial state and local entropy decrease brought about by quantum operations. The obtained universal upper bound on ergotropy implies that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis prohibits work extraction from energy eigenstates by means of finite-time unitary operations. This no-go property implies that Planck's principle, a form of the second law of thermodynamics, holds even for pure quantum states. Our result bridges two independently studied concepts of quantum thermodynamics, the second law and thermalization, via intrasystem correlations in many-body systems as a resource for work extraction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pete Rigas</p>
            <p>We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</p>

            <p>Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond and silicon carbide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we realize a device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon emission using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allow robust and persistent generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect structures of h-BN crystal.

            <h2>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hanlin Sun, Ginestra Bianconi</p>
            <p>In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kartick Ramakrishnan, Sambit Das, Phani Motamarri</p>
            <p>In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with a finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-space approach for DFT calculations, combining the efficiency of PAW formalism involving smooth electronic fields with the ability of systematically improvable higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we have developed efficient strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of the FE basis overlap matrix in conjunction with reduced order quadrature rules to invert the discretized PAW overlap matrix while also exploiting the sparsity of both the local and non-local parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach, we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with plane-wave-based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a considerable computational advantage ($\sim$ 5$\times$ -- 10$\times$) over state-of-the-art plane-wave methods for medium to large-scale systems ($\sim$ 6,000 -- 35,000 electrons). Finally, we show that our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to achieve the desired accuracy, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations ($>$ 50,000 electrons) at an order of magnitude lower computational cost compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations using finite-element discretized calculations.</p>

            <p>In order to examine the simulation of integrable quantum systems using quantum computers, it is crucial to first classify Yang-Baxter operators. Hietarinta was among the first to classify constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). Including the one produced by the permutation operator, he was able to construct eleven families of invertible solutions. These techniques are effective for 4 by 4 solutions, but they become difficult to use for representations with more dimensions. To get over this limitation, we use algebraic ansätze to generate the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent way. We employ four distinct algebraic structures that, depending on the qubit representation, replicate 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families. Among the techniques are partition algebras, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and a collection of commuting operators. Using these techniques, we do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuya Okita, Yusei Maruyama, Kento Kasahara, Nobuyuki Matubayasi</p>
            <p>Host-guest binding plays a crucial role in the functionality of various systems, and its efficiency is often quantified using the binding free energy, which represents the free-energy difference between the bound and dissociated states. Here, we propose a methodology to compute the binding free energy based on the energy representation (ER) theory of solution that enables us to evaluate the free-energy difference between the systems of interest with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike the other free-energy methods, such as the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR), the ER theory does not require the MD simulations for hypothetical intermediate states connecting the systems of interest, leading to reduced computational costs. By constructing the thermodynamic cycle of the binding process that is suitable for the ER theory, a robust calculation of the binding free energy is realized. We apply the present method to the self-association of \textit{N}-methylacetamide (NMA) in different solvents and the binding of aspirin to $\beta$-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. In the former case, the present method estimates that the binding free energy decreases as the solvent polarity decreases. This trend is consistent with the experimental finding. For the latter system, the binding free energies for the two representative CD-aspirin bound complexes, primary (P) and secondary (S) complexes, are estimated to be $-5.2\pm 0.1$ and $-5.03\pm 0.09~\mathrm{kcalmol^{-1}}$, respectively. These values are satisfactorily close to those from the BAR method [$-4.2\pm 0.2$ and $-4.1\pm 0.2\mathrm{kcal~mol^{-1}}$ for P and S, respectively]. Furthermore, the interaction-energy component analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction between aspirin and CD dominantly contributes to the stabilization of the bound complexes, that is in harmony with the well-known binding mechanism in the CD systems.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopic stress, couple stress and flux tensors derived through energetic equivalence from microscopic continuous and discrete heterogeneous finite representative volumes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Eliáš, Gianluca Cusatis</p>
            <p>This paper presents a rigorous derivation of equations to evaluate the macroscopic stress tensor, the couple stress tensor, and the flux vector equivalent to underlying microscopic fields in continuous and discrete heterogeneous systems with independent displacements and rotations. Contrary to the classical asymptotic expansion homogenization, finite size representative volume is considered. First, the macroscopic quantities are derived for a heterogeneous Cosserat continuum. The resulting continuum equations are discretized to provide macroscopic quantities in discrete heterogeneous systems. Finally, the expressions for discrete system are derived once again, this time considering the discrete nature directly. The formulations are presented in two variants, considering either internal or external forces, couples, and fluxes. The derivation is based on the virtual work equivalence and elucidates the fundamental significance of the couple stress tensor in the context of balance equations and admissible virtual deformation modes. Notably, an additional term in the couple stress tensor formula emerges, explaining its dependence on the reference system and position of the macroscopic point. The resulting equations are verified by comparing their predictions with known analytical solutions and results of other numerical models under both steady state and transient conditions.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing Dynamic Range of Sub-Quantum-Limit Measurements via Quantum Deamplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qi Liu, Ming Xue, Xinwei Li, Denis V. Vasilyev, Ling-Na Wu, Vladan Vuletić</p>
            <p>Balancing high sensitivity with a broad dynamic range is a fundamental challenge in measurement science, as improving one often compromises the other. While traditional quantum metrology has prioritized enhancing local sensitivity, a large dynamic range is crucial for applications such as atomic clocks, where extended phase interrogation times contribute to wider phase range. In this Letter, we introduce a novel quantum deamplification mechanism that extends dynamic range at a minimal cost of sensitivity. Our approach uses two sequential spin-squeezing operations to generate and detect an entangled probe state, respectively. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum interferometer limit can be approached through two-axis counter-twisting dynamics. Further expansion of dynamic range is possible by using sequential quantum deamplification interspersed with phase encoding processes. Additionally, we show that robustness against detection noise can be enhanced by a hybrid sensing scheme that combines quantum deamplification with quantum amplification. Our protocol is within the reach of state-of-the-art atomic-molecular-optical platforms, offering a scalable, noise-resilient pathway for entanglement-enhanced metrology.</p>

            <h2>Robust phase correction techniques for terahertz time-domain reflection spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kasturie D. Jatkar, Tien-Tien Yeh, Matteo Pancaldi, Stefano Bonetti</p>
            <p>We introduce a systematic approach that enables two robust methods for performing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry. Using the Kramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of the amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of the same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned measurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical properties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive index of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz range. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization states.</p>

            <h2>Quantum tunneling and its absence in deep wells and strong magnetic fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles L. Fefferman, Jacob Shapiro, Michael I. Weinstein</p>
            <p>We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.</p>
