            <h2>Theory of two-component superfluidity of microcavity polaritons</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Nafis Arafat, Oleg L. Berman, Godfrey Gumbs, Peter B. Littlewood</p>
            <p>We investigate Bose-Einstein condensation and two-component superfluidity composed of upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritons confined to a two-dimensional microcavity. By studying a modified Hamiltonian which incorporates interactions between both polariton branches, we derive the collective excitation spectrum and express the sound velocity as a function of detuning and Rabi splitting. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between effective masses and exciton-photon fractions in the UP and LP branches can significantly enhance the superfluid properties compared to a one-component condensate of only lower polaritons. Specifically, we discover that larger Rabi splitting increases the sound velocity and raises the critical temperature for superfluidity, while negative and positive detuning further favors a two-component condensate. Additionally, we demonstrate that these trends are consistent and applicable to various materials, including GaAs and the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), thereby indicating the potential for high-temperature superfluid phenomena in two-dimensional polariton systems. We hope these findings will provide a deeper understanding of the physics of structures containing multi-component polariton systems and generate experimental realizations of tunable quantum fluids with light.</p>

            <h2>Strong coupling of chiral magnons in altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhejunyu Jin, Tianci Gong, Jie Liu, Huanhuan Yang, Zhaozhuo Zeng, Yunshan Cao, Peng Yan</p>
            <p>Altermagnets recently are identified as a new class of magnets that break the time-reversal symmetry without exhibiting net magnetization. The role of the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) on their dynamical properties however is yet to be addressed. In this work, we show that the DDI can induce the strong coupling between exchange magnons with opposite chiralities in altermagnets, manifesting as a significant level repulsion in the magnon spectrum. Crucially, the predicted magnon-magnon coupling is highly anisotropic, and observable in practical experiments. These exotic features are absent in conventional antiferromagnets. Our findings open a new pathway for quantum magnonic information processing based on altermagnetism.</p>

            <h2>Quantum spin Hall effects in van der Waals materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jian Tang, Thomas Siyuan Ding, Chengdong Wang, Ning Mao, Vsevolod Belosevich, Yang Zhang, Xiaofeng Qian, Qiong Ma</p>
            <p>The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect, first predicted in graphene by Kane and Mele in 2004, has emerged as a prototypical platform for exploring spin-orbit coupling, topology, and electronic interactions. Initially realized experimentally in quantum wells exhibiting characteristic QSH signatures, the field has since expanded with the discovery of van der Waals (vdW) materials. This review focuses on vdW systems, which offer unique advantages: their exposed surfaces enable a combination of surface-sensitive spectroscopic and microscopic tools for comprehensive detection of the QSH state; mechanical stacking with other vdW layers facilitates symmetry engineering and proximity effects; and moiré engineering introduces layer skyrmion topological phases and strong correlation effects. We highlight two monolayer families, 1T$^\prime$-MX$_2$ and MM$^\prime$X$_4$, represented by WTe$_2$ and TaIrTe$_4$, respectively. These materials exhibit QSH phases intertwined with or in close proximity to other quantum phases, such as excitonic insulators, charge density waves, and superconductivity. Their low crystal symmetry and topology enable rich quantum geometrical responses, ranging from nonlinear Hall effects to circular photogalvanic effects. We also discuss moiré systems, which combine topology with flatband physics and enhanced correlations, driving spontaneous symmetry breaking and transitions from QSH to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Remarkably, fractionalized QAH and QSH states have recently been observed in moiré systems, significantly advancing the field of condensed matter physics. Finally, we explore emerging applications of QSH and derived materials, such as using nonlinear Hall effects for quantum rectification in microwave energy harvesting and harnessing fractional anomalous states for topological quantum computing.</p>

            <h2>Generalized many-body exciton g-factors: magnetic hybridization and non-monotonic Rydberg series in monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paulo E. Faria Junior, Daniel Hernangómez-Pérez, Tomer Amit, Jaroslav Fabian, Sivan Refaely-Abramson</p>
            <p>Magneto-optics of low dimensional semiconductors, such as monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, offers a vast playground for exploring complex quantum phenomena. However, current \textit{ab initio} approaches fail to capture important experimental observations related to brightening of excitonic levels and their g-factor dependence. Here, we develop a robust and general first principles framework for many-body exciton g-factors by incorporating off-diagonal terms for the spin and orbital angular momenta of single-particle bands and many-body states for magnetic fields pointing in arbitrary spatial directions. We implement our framework using many-body perturbation theory via the GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and supplement our analysis with robust symmetry-based models, establishing a fruitful synergy between many-body GW-BSE and group theory. Focusing on the archetypal monolayer WSe\textsubscript{2}, we accurately reproduce the known results of the low-energy excitons including the Zeeman splitting and the dark/grey exciton brightening. Furthermore, our theory naturally reveals fundamental physical mechanisms of magnetic-field hybridization of higher-energy excitons (s- and p-like) and resolves the long-standing puzzle of the experimentally measured non-monotonic Rydberg series (1s--4s) of exciton g-factors. Our framework offers a comprehensive approach to investigate, rationalize, and predict the non-trivial interplay between magnetic fields, angular momenta, and many-body exciton physics in van der Waals systems.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Spin Liquids in Pyrochlore Magnets With Non-Kramers Local Moments</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tony An, Félix Desrochers, Yong Baek Kim</p>
            <p>Numerous experiments on pyrochlore oxides Pr$_2$(Zr, Sn, Hf, Ir)$_2$O$_7$ with non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ ions suggest that they support a quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state, but the precise nature of the QSL remains unclear. Quantum spin ice with dominant dipolar Ising and smaller quadrupolar transverse exchange interactions is one such candidate, but a dominant inelastic neutron scattering signal suggests that such a picture may not be consistent with experimental results. The microscopic exchange couplings of these compounds are also not known, leaving room for many possible QSL states. In this work, we use Schwinger boson mean-field theory supplemented by a projective symmetry group classification to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSLs in pyrochlore magnets with dipolar-quadrupolar non-Kramers local moments. We build a mean-field phase diagram and find four QSLs in the frustrated region of parameter space that are consistent with inelastic signals observed in neutron scattering data on Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Among these, two robust QSLs occur in the regime with dominant transverse exchange rather than Ising exchange. We then compute the static and dynamic spin structure factors for these QSL candidates, which can be used to distinguish them in neutron scattering experiments.</p>

            <h2>Universal temperature-dependent power law excitation gaps in frustrated quantum spin systems harboring order-by-disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Hickey, Jeffrey G. Rau, Subhankar Khatua, Michel J. P. Gingras</p>
            <p>When magnetic moments are subject to competing or frustrated interactions, continuous degeneracies that are not protected by any symmetry of the parent Hamiltonian can emerge at the classical (mean-field) level. Such "accidental" degeneracies are often lifted by both thermal and quantum fluctuations via a mechanism known as order-by-disorder (ObD). The leading proposal to detect and characterize ObD in real materials, in a way that quantitatively distinguishes it from standard energetic selection, is to measure a small fluctuation-induced pseudo-Goldstone gap in the excitation spectrum. While the properties of this gap are known to leading order in the spin wave interactions, in both the zero-temperature and classical limits, the pseudo-Goldstone (PG) gap in quantum magnets at finite temperature has yet to be characterized. Using non-linear spin wave theory, we compute the PG gap to leading order in a $1/S$ expansion at low temperature for a variety of frustrated quantum spin systems. We also develop a formalism to calculate the PG gap in a way that solely uses linear spin-wave theory, circumventing the need to carry out tedious quantum many-body calculations. We argue that, at leading order, the PG gap acquires a distinct power-law temperature dependence, proportional to either $T^{d+1}$ or $T^{d/2+1}$ depending on the gapless dispersion of the PG mode predicted at the mean-field level. Finally, we examine the implications of these results for the pyrochlore oxide compound Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, for which there is compelling evidence of ObD giving rise to the experimentally observed long-range order.</p>

            <h2>Nonuniversal equation of state for Rabi-coupled bosonic gases: a droplet phase</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emerson Chiquillo</p>
            <p>Through an effective quantum field theory including zero temperature Gaussian fluctuations we derive analytical and explicit expressions for the equation of state of three-dimensional ultracold Rabi-coupled two-component bosonic gases with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions. At mean-field level the system presents two ground-states, one symmetric and one non-symmetric or unbalanced. For the symmetric ground state, in the regime where inter-species interactions are weakly attractive and subtly higher than repulsive intra-species, the instability by collapse is avoided by the contribution arising from Gaussian fluctuations, driving thus to formation of a liquidlike phase or droplet phase. This self-bound state is crucially affected by the dependence on the nonuniversal corrections to the interactions, which acts controlling the droplet stability. By tuning the ratio between the inter-species scattering length and the intra-species scattering lengths or the nonuniversal contribution to the interactions we address and establish conditions under which the formation and stability of self-bound Rabi-coupled droplets with nonuniversal corrections to the interactions is favorable.</p>

            <h2>Mechanochemical feedback drives complex inertial dynamics in active solids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhartha Sarkar, Biswarup Ash, Yueyang Wu, Nicholas Boechler, Suraj Shankar, Xiaoming Mao</p>
            <p>Active solids combine internal active driving with elasticity to realize states with nonequilibrium mechanics and autonomous motion. They are often studied in overdamped settings, e.g., in soft materials, and the role of inertia is less explored. We construct a model of a chemically active solid that incorporates mechanochemical feedback and show that, when feedback overwhelms mechanical damping, autonomous inertial dynamics can spontaneously emerge through sustained consumption of chemical fuel. By combining numerical simulations, analysis and dynamical systems approaches, we show how active feedback drives complex nonlinear dynamics on multiple time-scales, including limit cycles and chaos. Our results suggest design principles for creating ultrafast actuators and autonomous machines from soft, chemically-powered solids.</p>

            <h2>Correlations, mean-field limits, and transition to the concentrated regime in motile particle suspensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bryce Palmer, Scott Weady, Michael O'Brien, Blakesley Burkhart, Michael J. Shelley</p>
            <p>Suspensions of swimming particles exhibit complex collective behaviors driven by hydrodynamic interactions, showing persistent large-scale flows and long-range correlations. While heavily studied, it remains unclear how such structures depend on the system size and swimmer concentration. To address these issues, we simulate very large systems of suspended swimmers across a range of system sizes and volume fractions. For this we use high-performance simulation tools that build on slender body theory and implicit resolution of steric interactions. At low volume fractions and long times, the particle simulations reveal dynamic flow structures and correlation functions that scale with the system size. These results are consistent with a mean-field limit and agree well with a corresponding kinetic theory. At higher concentrations, the system departs from mean-field behavior. Flow structures become cellular, and correlation lengths scale with the particle size. Here, translational motion is suppressed, while rotational dynamics dominate. These findings highlight the limitations of dilute mean-field models and reveal new behaviors in dense active suspensions.</p>

            <h2>Circuit-level-configurable Zero-field Superconducting Diodes: A Universal Platform Beyond Intrinsic Symmetry Breaking</h2>

            <p>Modern industry seeks next-generation microelectronics with ultra-low dissipation and noise beyond semiconducting systems, where the superconducting electronics offer promise. Its physical foundation is the superconducting diode effect (SDE) with nonreciprocal supercurrent. SDE has hitherto mainly relied on material-specific intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductors, suffering from low yield, controllability, and compatibility with further functional extension - an undesirable aspect for applications. Here, we demonstrated a field-free SDE due to the chemical potential shift from external circuit line resistance, which is generic and challenges the previous interpretations of the intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductivity for zero-field SDE. Moreover, this SDE is circuit-level configurable since it can be electrically switched on/off with its polarity and efficiency precisely modulated via gate voltage and circuit reconfiguration, facilitating functional extension. Such a generic, controllable and extensible SDE addresses critical challenges in dissipationless circuit towards application, and thus establishes a robust platform for scalable superconducting electronics.</p>

            <h2>Strain Modulated Catalytic Activity of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caique C. Oliveira, Pedro A. S. Autreto</p>
            <p>The catalytic properties of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) in hydrogen-electrode- (HER-) based catalysts have been investigated based on state-of-the-art ab initio simulations. Our results show that the late transition metal sites (Hg and Zn) exhibit the best activity for HER in an acidic environment. Furthermore, lattice stretching and compression can effectively modulate the H binding energy, achieving almost thermoneutral adsorption at 3% compressive strain. The changes are attributed to the modulation in the d-band centers of late transition metal sites, as well as the depletion of charge population on bonding states, contributing to the destabilization of the H-metal bonds. Our contribution explores strain engineering as an effective strategy to tailor the activity of 2D mineral-based catalyst materials for HER, advancing our understanding of how mechanical manipulation can effectively modulate the catalytic properties of these materials.</p>

            <h2>Getting out of a tight spot: Cooperative unclogging of hydrogel particles in disordered porous media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanjana Kamath, Laurent Talon, Meera Ramaswamy, Christopher A. Browne, Sujit S. Datta</p>
            <p>We use event-driven pore network modeling to study the transport of hydrogel particles through disordered porous media -- a process that underlies diverse applications. By simulating particle advection, deformation, and clogging at the pore scale, we identify a dimensionless "squeezing parameter" that quantitatively predicts the depth to which particles penetrate into a given medium across diverse conditions. Our simulations also uncover a surprising cooperative effect: adding more particles enables them to penetrate deeper into the medium. This phenomenon arises because individual particles redirect fluid to adjacent throats, forcing nearby particles through tight pores that they would otherwise clog. Altogether, these results help to establish a quantitative framework that connects microscopic particle mechanics to macroscopic transport behavior.</p>

            <h2>Establishment of a compensation rule between the parameters of the Jonschers's Universal Relaxation Law in disordered materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anthony N. Papathanassiou, Elias Sakellis</p>
            <p>Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Almond - West Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.</p>

            <h2>Implementing advanced trial wave functions in fermion quantum Monte Carlo via stochastic sampling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi-Yu Xiao, Zixiang Lu, Yixiao Chen, Tao Xiang, Shiwei Zhang</p>
            <p>We introduce an efficient approach to implement correlated many-body trial wave functions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). To control the sign/phase problem in AFQMC, a constraint is derived from an exact gauge condition but is typically imposed approximately through a trial wave function or trial density matrix, whose quality can affect the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, the trial wave function can also affect the efficiency through importance sampling. The most natural form of the trial wave function has been single Slater determinants or their linear combinations. More sophisticated forms, for example, with the inclusion of a Jastrow factor or other explicit correlations, have been challenging to use and their implementation is often assumed to require a quantum computer. In this work, we demonstrate that a large class of correlated wave functions, written in the general form of multi-dimensional integrals over hidden or auxiliary variables times Slater determinants, can be implemented as trial wave function by coupling the random walkers to a generalized Metropolis sampling. We discuss the fidelity of AFQMC with stochastically sampled trial wave functions, which are relevant to both quantum and classical algorithms. We illustrate the method and show that an efficient implementation can be achieved which preserves the low-polynomial computational scaling of AFQMC. We test our method in molecules under bond stretching and in transition metal diatomics. Significant improvements are seen in both accuracy and efficiency over typical trial wave functions, and the method yields total ground-state energies systematically within chemical accuracy. The method can be useful for incorporating other advanced wave functions, for example, neural quantum state wave functions optimized from machine learning techniques, or for other forms of fermion quantum Monte Carlo.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous Transport Gaps of Fractional Quantum Hall Phases in Graphene Landau Levels are Induced by Spin-Valley Entangled Ground States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jincheng An, Ajit C. Balram, Udit Khanna, Ganpathy Murthy</p>
            <p>We evaluate the transport gaps in the most prominent fractional quantum Hall states in the $\mathbf{n}{=}0$ and $\mathbf{n}{=}1$ Landau Levels of graphene, accounting for the Coulomb interaction, lattice-scale anisotropies, and one-body terms. We find that the fractional phases in the $\mathbf{n}{=}0$ Landau level are bond-ordered, while those in the $\mathbf{n}{=}1$ Landau level are spin-valley entangled. This resolves a long-standing experimental puzzle [Amet, $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Comm. $\mathbf{6}$, 5838 (2015)] of the contrasting Zeeman dependence of the transport gaps in the two Landau levels. The spin-valley entangled phases host gapless Goldstone modes that can be probed via bulk thermal transport measurements. As a byproduct of our computations, we place strong constraints on the values of the microscopic anisotropic couplings such that these are consistent with all known experimental results.</p>

            <h2>High-Entropy Solid Electrolytes Discovery: A Dual-Stage Machine Learning Framework Bridging Atomic Configurations and Ionic Transport Properties</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiao Fu, Jing Xu, Qifan Yang, Xuhe Gong, Jingchen Lian, Liqi Wang, Zibin Wang, Ruijuan Xiao, Hong Li</p>
            <p>The rapid development of computational materials science powered by machine learning (ML) is gradually leading to solutions to several previously intractable scientific problems. One of the most prominent is machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which expedites the study of dynamical methods for large-scale systems. However, a promising field, high-entropy (HE) solid-state electrolytes (SEs) remain constrained by trial-and-error paradigms, lacking systematic computational strategies to address their huge and high-dimensional composition space. In this work, we establish a dual-stage ML framework that combines fine-tuned MLIPs with interpretable feature-property mapping to accelerate the high-entropy SEs discovery. Using Li$_3$Zr$_2$Si$_2$PO$_{12}$ (LZSP) as a prototype, the fine-tuned CHGNet-based relaxation provides atomic structure for each configuration, the structure features - mean squared displacement (SF-MSD) model predicts the ionic transport properties and identifies critical descriptors. The theoretical studies indicate that the framework can satisfy the multiple requirements including computational efficiency, generalization reliability and prediction accuracy. One of the most promising element combinations in the quinary HE-LZSP space containing 4575 compositions is identified with a high ionic conductivity of 4.53 mS/cm as an application example. The framework contains generalizability and extensibility to other SE families.</p>

            <p>The combination of superconductivity and magnetic textures represents a promising approach to explore unconventional superconducting phenomena, including new correlated and topological phases. Van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged in this context as a versatile platform to explore the interplay between these two competing orders. Here, we report on individual NbSe2/NiPS3/NbSe2 vdW Josephson junctions behaving as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which we attribute to the interplay between the superconductivity of NbSe2 and the spin texture of the vdW antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3. The SQUID behavior, which persists for in-plane magnetic fields of at least 6 T, is the result of interference between localized transport channels that form in two separate regions of the sample. Microscopic modeling of the antiferromagnet insulator/superconductor (AFI/S) interface reveals the formation of localized states at the edges of the junction that can lead to localized channels that dominate the transport. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW superconducting heterostructures with AFs as platforms for engineering and probing novel superconducting phenomena, and they establish a new route for lithographic-free SQUIDs that operate in high magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Ligand-SOC enhanced $4f^5$ Kitaev antiferromagnet: Application to $\mathrm{SmI}_3$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Hao Xia, Yi-Peng Gao, Zhao-Yang Dong, Jian-Xin Li</p>
            <p>The search for Kitaev quantum spin liquids (Kitaev-QSLs) in real materials has mainly focused on $4d$- and $5d$-electron honeycomb systems. A recent experimental study on the $4f^5$ honeycomb iodide $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ reported the absence of long-range magnetic order down to $0.1\ \text{K}$, suggesting a possible Kitaev-QSL phase. Motivated by the interplay between the complex exchange processes inherent to the $4f^5$ multi-electron configuration and the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of the iodine ligands, we systematically investigate the effective exchange interactions in $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ using the strong coupling expansion method. Our findings reveal that bond-dependent SOCs (bond-SOCs), extracted from relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, significantly enhance the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction, driving the system close to the AFM Kitaev point. A microscopic analysis based on the Slater-Koster approach further indicates that the strong SOC of the iodine ligands (ligand-SOC) is the origin of bond-SOCs and plays a pivotal role in mediating the superexchange processes. Additionally, we identify a spin-flop transition induced by the bond-SOCs, where the enhanced AFM Kitaev interactions shift the AFM order from the out-of-plane $[1, 1, 1]$-direction to an in-plane orientation, breaking the $C_3$ rotational symmetry. Linear spin-wave theory (LSWT) further predicts the emergence of gapless modes following the spin-flop transition, indicating enhanced fluctuations and increased instability near the AFM Kitaev point. Our results highlight the crucial role of strong ligand-SOC in stabilizing the dominant AFM Kitaev interactions in $\mathrm{SmI}_3$ and provide valuable insights for discovering new $f$-electron Kitaev-QSL candidates.</p>

            <p>Parity-time-reversal-symmetric odd-parity antiferromagnetic (AFM1) materials are of interest for their symmetry-enabled quantum transport and optical effects. These materials host odd-parity terms in their band dispersion, leading to asymmetric energy bands and enabling responses such as the magnetopiezoelectric effect, nonreciprocal conductivity, and photocurrent generation. In addition, they may support a nonlinear spin Hall effect without spin-orbit coupling, offering an efficient route to spin current generation. We identify 23 candidate AFM1 materials by combining artificial intelligence, density functional theory (DFT), and symmetry analysis. Using a graph neural network model and incorporating AFM1-specific symmetry constraints, we screen Materials Project compounds for high-probability AFM1 candidates. DFT calculations show that AFM1 has the lowest energy among the tested magnetic configurations in 23 candidate materials. These include 3 experimentally verified AFM1 materials, 10 synthesized compounds with unknown magnetic structures, and 10 that are not yet synthesized.</p>

            <h2>Coupling an elastic string to an active bath: the emergence of inverse damping</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aaron Beyen, Christian Maes, Ji-Hui Pei</p>
            <p>We consider a slow elastic string with Klein-Gordon dynamics coupled to a bath of run-and-tumble particles. We derive and solve the induced Langevin-Klein-Gordon string dynamics with explicit expressions for the streaming term, friction coefficient, and noise variance. These parameters are computed exactly in a weak coupling expansion. The induced friction is a sum of two terms: one entropic, proportional to the noise variance as in the Einstein relation for a thermal equilibrium bath, and a frenetic contribution that can take both signs. The frenetic part wins for higher bath persistence, making the total friction negative, and hence creating a wave instability akin to inverse Landau damping; the wave acceleration decreases again when the propulsion speed of the active particles gets too high.</p>

            <p>The optical responses for UV to NIR and muti-directional photo current have been found on Au (metal) on n-Si device. The unique phenomena have been unresolved since the first sample fabricated in 2007. The self organized sub-micron metal with various crystal faces was supposed to activate as an optical wave guide into Si surface. This, however, is insufficient to explain the unique features above. Thus, for more deep analysis, returning to consider the Si-band structure, indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with scattering, successfully give these characteristics a reasonable explanation. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-W and X-K agreed with those sensitivity for visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the doping process well simulates it for NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Doping electrons (~10^18/cm3) are filled up the zero-gap at around X of a reciprocal lattice point. This is why a lower limit of 0.6 eV was arisen in the sensitivity measurement. When the carrier scattering model was applied to the inter band (X-W, X-K and {\Gamma}-L) transitions, the reasonable interpretation was obtained for the directional dependence of photo-currents with UV (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.1 and 1.9 eV) excitation. Band to band scatterings assist to extend the available optical range and increase variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle for some indirect transition semiconductors, it will be able to open the new frontier in photo-conversion system, where it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.</p>

            <h2>Ubiquity of rotational symmetry breaking in superconducting films, from Fe(Te,Se)/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ to Nb, and the effect of measurement geometry</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Debarghya Mallick, Hee Taek Yi, Xiaoyu Yuan, Seongshik Oh</p>
            <p>FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$/Bi$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructure is a promising new platform in the journey toward topological quantum computation, considering that first, FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ is itself known to be a topological superconductor (TSC) and second, the heterostructure has topological interface states that can be proximitized into TSC even if FTS fails to become TSC on its own. Here, we show that this system exhibits quasi-2D superconductivity, and utilizing the standard in-plane magneto-transport measurements, we discover two-fold anisotropy (a.k.a nematicity) in R$_{xx}$ and I$_c$ measurement, even though the system exhibits globally 12-fold symmetry. Then, we carried out similar measurements on a polycrystalline niobium (Nb) thin film, a well-known s-wave elemental superconductor, and found a similar two-fold symmetry even for this Nb system. This implies either that nematic behavior is ubiquitous or that the in-plane magneto-transport measurement scheme routinely used to detect nematicity is not a reliable method to probe nematicity. We show that the angle-dependent response of vortices in the superconducting regime to the magnetic Lorentz force is very likely the main cause behind the ubiquitous nematic behaviors of this measurement scheme. In other words, this measurement scheme is intrinsically two-fold, and is therefore not suitable to detect the nematicity. Accordingly, all the previous reports of nematicity based on similar measurement practices, reported on various samples, including thin films, bulk crystals, and exfoliated flakes, need to be reinterpreted.</p>

            <h2>Statistical Mechanics and Categorical Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haiqi Wu, Kai Xu</p>
            <p>This paper investigates the relationship between categorical entropy and von Neumann entropy of quantum lattices. We begin by studying the von Neumann entropy, proving that the average von Neumann entropy per site converges to the logarithm of an algebraic integer in the low-temperature and thermodynamic limits. Next, we turn to categorical entropy. Given an endofunctor of a saturated A-infinity-category, we construct a corresponding lattice model, through which the categorical entropy can be understood in terms of the information encoded in the model. Finally, by introducing a gauged lattice framework, we unify these two notions of entropy. This unification leads naturally to a sufficient condition for a conjectural algebraicity property of categorical entropy, suggesting a deeper structural connection between A-infinity-categories and statistical mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Spinodal and Equilibrium Global Phase Diagram of the d=3 Merged Potts-Cubic-Clock Model: First-Order Equilibrium and Second-Order Spinodal Boundaries with Hidden Topologies from Renormalization-Group Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Umut Acikel, A. Nihat Berker</p>
            <p>A model that merges the Potts, cubic, and clock models is studied in spatial dimension d=3 by renormalization-group theory. Effective vacancies are included in the renormalization-group initial conditions. In the global phase diagram, 5 different ordered phases, namely ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, antiferrimagnetic, axial, and a disordered phase are found, separated by first- and second-order phase boundaries. 8 different phase diagram cross-sections occur. When the effective vacancies are suppressed, the global spinodal phase diagram is found: All disordering phase transitions become second order, the disordered phase recedes, and 17 different phase diagram cross-sections occur, spinodality thus much enriching ordering behavior. In the spinodal phase diagram, the ferrimagnetic and antiferrimagnetic phases have reentrance. The employed renormalization group transformation is exact on the d=3 dimensional hierarchical model and Migdal-Kadanoff approximate on the cubic lattice.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwanghee Han, Heeyeon Lee, Minseong Kwon, Vinod Menon, Chaun Jang, Young Duck Kim</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors show promise for atomically thin flexible and transparent optoelectronic devices in future this http URL, developing high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials is impeded by two key challenges, the high contact resistance at the 2D semiconductors-metal interface and the limited effective doping strategies. Here, we present a novel approach to overcome these challenges using self-propagating liquid Fields metal, a eutectic alloy with a low melting point of approximately 62 C. By modifying pre-patterned electrodes on WSe2 FETs through the deposition of Fields metal onto contact pad edges followed by vacuum annealing, we create new semimetal electrodes that seamlessly incorporate the liquid metal into 2D semiconductors. This integration preserves the original electrode architecture while transforming to semimetal compositions of Fields metal such as Bi, In, and Sn modifies the work functions to 2D semiconductors, resulting in reduced contact resistance without inducing Fermi-level pinning and charge carrier mobilities. Our method enhances the electrical performance of 2D devices and opens new avenues for designing high-resolution liquid metal circuits suitable for stretchable, flexible, and wearable 2D semiconductor applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Alessandrelli, Adriano Barra, Andrea Ladiana, Andrea Lepre, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi</p>
            <p>This paper introduces a learning framework for Three-Directional Associative Memory (TAM) models, extending the classical Hebbian paradigm to both supervised and unsupervised protocols within an hetero-associative setting. These neural networks consist of three interconnected layers of binary neurons interacting via generalized Hebbian synaptic couplings that allow learning, storage and retrieval of structured triplets of patterns. By relying upon glassy statistical mechanical techniques (mainly replica theory and Guerra interpolation), we analyze the emergent computational properties of these networks, at work with random (Rademacher) datasets and at the replica-symmetric level of description: we obtain a set of self-consistency equations for the order parameters that quantify the critical dataset sizes (i.e. their thresholds for learning) and describe the retrieval performance of these networks, highlighting the differences between supervised and unsupervised protocols. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness of the captured picture about TAMs also at work with structured datasets. In particular, this study provides insights into the cooperative interplay of layers, beyond that of the neurons within the layers, with potential implications for optimal design of artificial neural network architectures.</p>

            <p>In biology, ligand mediated transitions (LMT), where the binding of a molecular ligand onto the binding site of a receptor molecule leads to a well-defined change in the conformation of the receptor, are often referred to as 'the second secret of life'. Sharp, cooperative transitions arise in many biological cases, while examples of synthetic cooperative systems are rare. This is because well-defined conformational states are hard to 'program' into a molecular design. Here, we impose an external constraint in the form of two immiscible liquids that effectively define and limit the available conformational states of two different synthetic and relatively simple macromolecules. We show that the mechanism of the observed cooperative transitions with ligand concentration is the coupling of ligand binding and conformation, similar to more complex biological systems. The systems studied are: (1) Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes (HPE), which are (bio) polymers that consist of hydrophobic as well as ionizable (proton and hydroxyl ligand-binding) functional groups. (2) Oligomeric metal chelators (OMC), which are oligomers composed of metal ion chelating repeating groups that are able to bind metal ions (considered as the 'ligands'), resulting in gel-like networks of oligomers crosslinked by coordinated metal ions. We find that in HPE, interactions between ligands and individual macromolecules explain the observed cooperative transitions. For OMC, coordinated bonds significantly enhance the degree of cooperativity, compared to HPE.</p>

            <p>Understanding carrier dynamics in photoexcited metal-halide perovskites is key for optoelectronic devices such as solar cells (low carrier densities) and lasers (high carrier densities). Trapping processes at low carrier densities and many-body recombination at high densities can significantly alter the dynamics of photoexcited carriers. Combining optical-pump/THz probe and transient absorption spectroscopy we examine carrier responses over a wide density range (10^14-10^19 cm-3) and temperatures (78-315K) in the prototypical methylammonium lead iodide perovskite. At densities below ~10^15 cm-3 (room temperature, sunlight conditions), fast carrier trapping at shallow trap states occurs within a few picoseconds. As excited carrier densities increase, trapping saturates, and the carrier response stabilizes, lasting up to hundreds of picoseconds at densities around ~10^17 cm-3. Above 10^18 cm-3 a Mott transition sets in: overlapping polaron wavefunctions lead to ultrafast annihilation through an Auger recombination process occurring over a few picoseconds. We map out trap-dominated, direct recombination-dominated, and Mott-dominated density regimes from 78-315 K, ultimately enabling the construction of an electronic phase diagram. These findings clarify carrier behavior across operational conditions, aiding material optimization for optoelectronics operating in the low (e.g. photovoltaics) and high (e.g. laser) carrier density regimes.</p>

            <p>The rare-earth triangular-lattice magnet NdMgAl11O19 offers an ideal platform for examining the interplay of crystal electric field effects, geometric frustration, and weak exchange interactions. Using high-quality single crystals, we measured magnetic susceptibility and magnetization down to 1.8 K, while specific heat was measured down to 45 mK. The system exhibits uniaxial anisotropy along the c-axis, with a ground-state Kramers doublet. A Curie-Weiss temperature of -0.38 K indicates weak antiferromagnetic interactions, while a specific heat anomaly at 81 mK suggests weak magnetic correlations with no long-range magnetic order. The absence of long-range magnetic order down to 45 mK makes it a very interesting material, which is highly frustrated but weakly correlated. Under external fields, the Zeeman splitting of the ground-state doublet leads to a field-tunable Schottky anomaly, with the specific heat peak shifting to 0.65 meV at 3 T, with g ~ 3.7. A Brillouin function fit to magnetization yields g ~ 3.72, confirming the quasi-paramagnetic nature of NdMgAl11O19. These findings highlight NdMgAl11O19 as a promising candidate to investigate quantum spin liquid and exotic spin states in frustrated triangular magnets.</p>

            <p>The thermoelectric figure of merit of the Heusler alloy TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was investigated by first-principles calculations of lattice thermal conductivity. The electronic thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient are calculated by semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb was found to be thermally and dynamically stable, as confirmed by its phonon dispersion. Additionally, the small phonon band gap between acoustic and optical modes enhances phonon scattering, leading to a low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.703 W/mK at 300 K. Our study also reveals that TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb is a non-magnetic semiconductor. Notably, it demonstrates a significant longitudinal thermoelectric effect, with a Seebeck coefficient of 359.4 $\mu$V/K at 300 K. The combination of low lattice thermal conductivity and a high Seebeck coefficient results in a high thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.88 and 0.91 at 300 K and 500 K, respectively. These findings highlight the considerable potential of TiFe$_{1.5}$Sb as a promising material for thermoelectric device applications.</p>

            <p>We study the influence of a localized Gaussian deformation on massless Dirac fermions confined to a two-dimensional curved surface. Both in-plane and out-of-plane displacements are considered within the framework of elasticity theory. These deformations couple to the Dirac spinors via the spin connection and the vielbeins, leading to a position-dependent Fermi velocity and an effective geometric potential. We show that the spin connection contributes an attractive potential centered on the deformation and explore how this influences the fermionic density of states. Analytical and numerical solutions reveal the emergence of bound states near the deformation and demonstrate how the Lamé coefficients affect curvature and state localization. Upon introducing an external magnetic field, the effective potential becomes confining at large distances, producing localized Landau levels that concentrate near the deformation. A geometric Aharonov-Bohm phase is identified through the spinor holonomy. These results contribute to the understanding of strain-induced electronic effects in Dirac materials, such as graphene.</p>

We present the band structure using an unconventional scheme designed to highlight the distinctive spin splitting which is characteristic of altermagnets.

We show that the nodal surfaces of the spin-splitting function that follow from symmetry can be classified into two types, which we call symmetry-enforced and continuity-enforced. We describe the spin-splitting function with a simple parametrization in a basis of symmetry-adapted plane waves. Using group-theory analysis based on irreducible representations of the crystallographic Laue group, we confirm that the altermagnetism of G-type BiFeO$_3$ is $g$-wave and present a complete classification table for the general three-dimensional case. Finally, we discuss the effect of ferroelectric switching on the altermagnetic order, and identify three classes of ferroelectric altermagnets.</p>

            <p>The deposition of droplets onto a swollen polymer network induces the formation of a wetting ridge at the contact line. Current models typically consider either viscoelastic effects or poroelastic effects, while polymeric gels often exhibit both properties. In this study, we investigate the growth of the wetting ridge using a comprehensive large deformation theory that integrates both dissipative mechanisms - viscoelasticity and poroelasticity. In the purely poroelastic case, following an initial instantaneous incompressible deformation, the growth dynamics exhibit scale-free behavior, independent of the elastocapillary length or system size. A boundary layer of solvent imbibition between the solid surface (in contact with the reservoir) and the region of minimal chemical potential is created. At later times, the ridge equilibrates on the diffusion timescale given by the elastocapillary length. When viscoelastic properties are incorporated, our findings show that, during the early stages (prior to the viscoelastic relaxation timescale), viscoelastic effects dominate the growth dynamics of the ridge and solvent transport is significantly suppressed. Beyond the relaxation time, the late-time dynamics closely resemble those of the purely poroelastic case. These findings are discussed in light of recent experiments, showing how our approach offers a new interpretation framework for wetting of polymer networks of increasing complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Timo Bisswanger, Anne Schmidt, Frank Volmer, Christoph Stampfer, Bernd Beschoten</p>
            <p>A spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane spins in bilayer graphene (BLG) can be achieved by spin-orbit proximity coupling of graphene to transition metal dichalcogenides. This coupling reduces the in-plane spin lifetime due to proximity-induced spin scattering, while the out-of-plane spin lifetime remains largely unaffected. We show that at room temperature spin lifetime anisotropy exceeds 60 in a bilayer graphene lateral spin valve proximity coupled to WSe$_2$. The out-of-plane spin lifetime of about 250 ps closely matches that of a BLG reference region not in contact with WSe$_2$. In contrast, the estimated in-plane spin lifetime of less than 4 ps leads to a complete suppression of the in-plane spin signal at the ferromagnetic Co/MgO spin detector. The proximity coupling of WSe$_2$ to BLG is particularly promising, as it does not compromise the charge carrier mobility within the graphene channel.</p>

            <p>Tobermorite and Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) systems are indispensable cement materials but still lack a satisfactory interatomic potential with both high accuracy and high computational efficiency for better understanding their mechanical performance. Here, we develop a Neuroevolution Machine Learning Potential (NEP) with Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark hybrid framework for tobermorite and C-S-H systems, which conveys unprecedented efficiency in molecular dynamics simulations with substantially reduced training datasets. Our NEP model achieves prediction accuracy comparable to DFT calculations using just around 300 training structures, significantly fewer than other existing machine learning potentials trained for tobermorite. Critically, the GPU-accelerated NEP computations enable scalable simulations of large tobermorite systems, reaching several thousand atoms per GPU card with high efficiency. We demonstrate the NEP's versatility by accurately predicting mechanical properties, phonon density of states, and thermal conductivity of tobermorite. Furthermore, we extend the NEP application to large-scale simulations of amorphous C-S-H, highlighting its potential for comprehensive analysis of structural and mechanical behaviors under various realistic conditions.</p>

            <p>Magnetic properties of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) are highly sensitive to various factors such as the Sr doping level $x$, lattice strain, and oxygen stoichiometry due to the strongly correlated nature of $3d$ electrons. For the development of energy-efficient spintronic devices with ultra-low magnetic damping of LSMO, a thorough understanding of its complex magnetization dynamics is of great importance. In this work, we have measured ferromagnetic resonance of LSMO thin films on Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (Nb-STO) substrates over a wide temperature and frequency range and observed an anomalous increase in the Gilbert damping constant and a decrease in the effective saturation magnetization at temperatures below 100 K. The anomalies become more pronounced as the LSMO thickness decreases while they are not observed for LSMO on (LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$ substrates with relatively small epitaxial strain. The results suggest that the epitaxial strain-induced magnetically dead layer at the LSMO/Nb-STO interface acts as a spin sink and leads to the anomalies in the magnetization dynamics.</p>

            <p>Unconventional superconductivity typically emerges out of a strongly correlated normal state, manifesting as a Fermi liquid with highly enhanced effective mass or a strange metal with $T$-linear resistivity in the zero-temperature limit. In Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelates $R_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, superconductivity with a critical temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) exceeding 80 and 40 K has been respectively realised in bulk crystals under high pressure and thin films under compressive strain. These advancements create new materials platforms to study the nature of high-$T_{\rm c}$ superconductivity, calling for the characterisation of fundamental normal-state and superconducting parameters therein. Here we report detailed magnetotransport experiments on superconducting La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ (LPNO) thin films under pulsed magnetic fields up to 64 T and access the normal-state behaviour over a wide temperature range between 1.5 and 300 K. We find that the normal state of LPNO exhibits the hallmarks of Fermi liquid transport, including $T^2$ temperature dependence of resistivity and Hall angle, and $H^2$ magnetoresistance obeying Kohler scaling. Using the empirical Kadowaki-Woods ratio relating the transport coefficient and electronic specific heat, we estimate a quasiparticle effective mass $m^*/m_e \simeq 10$ in PLNO, thereby revealing the highly renormalized Fermi liquid state which hosts the high-temperature nickelate superconductivity. Our results demonstrate that LPNO follows the same $T_{\rm c}/T_{\rm F}^*$ scaling observed across a wide variety of strongly correlated superconductors and provide crucial constraints for a viable model for superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.</p>

In this study, we calculated the number of key constituent elements in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic units based on the copolymer composition, and investigated their relationship with hydroxide ion conductivity by using Bayesian sparse modeling. As a result, we successfully identified composition-derived features that are critical for accurately predicting hydroxide ion conductivity.</p>

            <h2>Thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au metallic alloys determined by resonant scattering</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kacper Pryga, Bartlomiej Wiendlocha</p>
            <p>This work presents a theoretical study of the electronic structure and transport properties of Ni-Au alloys, recently identified as excellent thermoelectric metals with a power factor significantly exceeding that of conventional semiconductor thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and the Kubo-Greenwood formalism, we demonstrate the key role of resonant scattering in determining the thermoelectric properties of these alloys. This is supported by calculated densities of states, Bloch spectral functions, electrical conductivity, and thermopower. Alloying Ni with Au not only induces resonant scattering but also leads to the formation of a flat band below the Fermi level. The combination of these two features results in high thermopower, arising from a transition between resonant and weak scattering regimes near the Fermi level. Our findings are further compared with analogous calculations for constantan, a Ni-Cu alloy long regarded as a reference thermoelectric metal. We show that differences between the Ni-Au and Ni-Cu systems explain why Ni-Au exhibits nearly twice the thermopower of Ni-Cu. Finally, we simulate the effect of lattice parameter variation on the thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au and suggest that this is a promising pathway for further enhancement, for example through additional alloying or layer deposition.</p>

We compute several observables, including the condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of quantum coherence, to characterize the transition from the Mott insulator to the superfluid phase. In the standard Bose-Hubbard model, ground-state properties exhibit signatures of a quantum phase transition under open boundary conditions. While finite-size effects preclude an exact realization of the thermodynamic transition, our findings serve as indicators of the underlying quantum critical behavior of the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. At finite temperatures, this critical point shifts to a smooth crossover, reflecting the suppression of long-range coherence typical of larger systems. A nonzero Stark potential delays this crossover, promoting localization and the formation of non-superfluid condensates. In contrast, thermal fluctuations can induce unexpected coherence through fluctuation-driven tunneling. Disorder disrupts superfluidity but preserves local coherence, with thermal states exhibiting an enhanced $\ell_1$-norm of coherence within the Bose glass regime. Our results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature jointly reshape the coherence landscape, and offer valuable insights for quantum simulation and the characterization of quantum phases in strongly correlated systems. Non-ergodic behavior is observed in the clean system where the mean gap ratio stays below Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) values. With a Stark potential, level statistics shift from Poisson-like to near-GOE as tunneling increases, which indicates a crossover to semi-ergodic dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Tunable Fujita-Miyazawa-Type Three-Body Force in Ultracold Atoms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hiroyuki Tajima, Eiji Nakano, Kei Iida</p>
            <p>We show how a Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force emerges among three impurity atoms immersed in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. As a result of thermal average over excitations in the medium and impurities as well as expansion with respect to the impurity-medium and Feshbach resonance couplings, two superfluid phonons and a closed channel resonance play a role in producing an effective three-body force, as in the original three-nucleon case in which two pions and a $\Delta$ resonance are involved. The proposed Fujita-Miyazawa-type three-body force can be enhanced by tuning the closed-channel energy level via an external magnetic field, and moreover, its strength can be confirmed experimentally by measuring the impurity equation of state. Our result gives a new insight into an analogy between atomic polarons and nuclear few-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Extreme value statistics in a continuous time branching process: a pedagogical primer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satya N. Majumdar, Alberto Rosso</p>
            <p>We study a continuous time branching process where an individual splits into two daughters with rate b and dies with rate a, starting from a single individual at t=0. We show that the model can be mapped exactly to a random walk problem where the population size N(t) performs a random walk on a positive semi-infinite lattice. The hopping rate of this random walker out of a site labelled n is proportional to n, i.e., the walker gets more and more `agitated' as it moves further and further away from the origin--we call this an `agitated random walk' (ARW). We demonstrate that this random walk problem is particularly suitable to obtain exact explicit results on the extreme value statistics, namely, on the distribution of the maximal population size M(t)= \max_{0\tau\le t}[N(\tau)] up to time t. This extreme value distribution displays markedly different behaviors in the three phases: (i) subcritical (b<a) (ii) critical (b=a) and (iii) supercritical (b>a). In the subcritical and critical phases , Q(L,t) becomes independent of time t for large t and the stationary distribution Q(L, \infty) decays to zero with increasing L, respectively exponentially (subcritical) and algebraically (critical). For finite but large t, the distribution at the critical point exhibits a scaling form Q(L,t)\sim f_c(L/{at})/L^2 where the scaling function f_c(z) has a nontrivial shape that we compute analytically. In the supercritical phase, the distribution Q(L,t) has a `fluid' part that becomes independent of t for large t and a `condensate' part (a delta peak centered at e^{(b-a)t}) which gets disconnected from the `fluid' part and moves rapidly to \infty as time increases. We also verify our analytical predictions via numerical simulations finding excellent agreement.</p>

It includes temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT), along with metadata on materials and their corresponding publications. A self-consistent ZT (Sc-ZT) filter set was developed to measure ZT errors by comparing reported ZT's from figures with ZT's recalculated from digitized TEPs. Using this Sc-ZT protocol, we generated tMatDb272, comprising 14,717 temperature-property pairs from 272 high-quality TEP sets across 262 publications. The method identifies various types of ZT errors, such as resolution error, publication bias, ZT overestimation, interpolation and extrapolation error, and digitization noise, and excludes inconsistent samples from the dataset. teMatDb272 and the Sc-ZT filtering framework offer a robust dataset for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials design, device modeling, and future thermoelectric research.</p>

            <h2>Revealing molecule-internal mechanisms that control phonon heat transport through single-molecule junctions by a genetic algorithm</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthias Blaschke, Fabian Pauly</p>
            <p>Measurements of the thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions have recently been reported for the first time. It is presently unclear, how much the heat transport can be controlled through molecule-internal effects. The search for molecules with lowest and highest thermal conductance is complicated by the gigantic chemical space. Here we describe a systematic search for molecules with a low or a high phononic thermal conductance using a genetic algorithm. Beyond individual structures of well performing molecules, delivered by the genetic algorithm, we analyze patterns and identify the different physical and chemical mechanisms to suppress or enhance phonon heat flow. In detail, mechanisms revealed to reduce phonon transport are related to the choice of terminal linker blocks, substituents and corresponding mass disorder or destructive interference, meta couplings and molecule-internal twist. For a high thermal conductance, the molecules should instead be rather uniform and chain-like. The identified mechanisms are systematically analyzed at different levels of theory, and their significance is classified. Our findings are expected to be important for the emerging field of molecular phononics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vivek Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey</p>
            <p>The anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) is a key transport property in magnetic and topological materials, arising from the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) of electronic bands. It offers deep insight into the underlying topology and thermoelectric behavior. While Wannier interpolation have become popular for calculating ANC due to their computational efficiency, their accuracy critically depends on the quality of the Wannierization, which can be challenging for entangled bands or materials with complex band crossings. These limitations highlight the need for a direct first-principles approach to reliably compute ANC from ab-initio electronic structures. Here, we present a C++ based code named C-BerryANC that calculates $\boldsymbol\Omega$-dependent ANC by directly using the eigenvalues and momentum-matrices obtained from DFT calculations. Presently, the code is interfaced with WIEN2k package which uses all-electron approach and full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) based method. For efficiently handling dense k-mesh, calculation of $\boldsymbol\Omega$ is made parallel over k-points using the OpenMP method. Additionally, the code stores band-resolved components of $\boldsymbol\Omega$ in binary files thereby reducing the memory occupancy and providing fast post-process option to compute ANC for any range of chemical potential and temperature values. Also, as compilation of C++ modules produce executable files which are in machine level language, computational speed of C-BerryANC is very fast. The code is benchmarked over some well-known materials exhibiting ANC. These includes- Pd, Fe$_3$Al & Co$_2$FeAl. The obtained values of ANC is found to in good agreement with the previously reported data. This highlights the accuracy, efficieny and reliability of the C-BerryANC code.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Self-Organized Criticality through Memory-Driven Random Walks on Complex Networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Jafari</p>
            <p>We present a stochastic model of memory-driven random walks on complex networks, where a single walker explores the network through a combination of local random walks and memory-based resetting. The walker either moves to a neighboring node or resets to a previously visited node with a probability proportional to the visitation this http URL node in the network accumulates stress with every visit, and once the accumulated stress exceeds a threshold, the node topples, redistributing the stress to its neighbors. This redistribution can trigger cascading avalanches across the network. We demonstrate that this simple memory-driven mechanism, combined with local stress dynamics, leads to the emergence of self-organized criticality (SOC) across various network topologies, including Small-World and BA this http URL resulting avalanche size distributions follow power-law statistics, with exponents that are consistent with those found in classical SOC systems. Our model requires no fine-tuning of parameters to achieve criticality and offers a novel insight into how memory, network structure, and local stress interactions can give rise to emergent critical phenomena. These findings have implications for understanding cascading failures in infrastructure, neural avalanches in brain dynamics, and information spread in complex networks.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive ab initio dataset of formation energies and elastic properties of intrinsic point defects across all the transition and rare earth hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals, as well as metalloid elements with hcp crystal structure. Point defect properties appear weakly correlated with the c/a ratio of the hcp lattice. Instead, it is the position of an element in the Periodic Table that primarily defines the relaxation volume tensor, elastic dipole tensor and formation energy of a point defect. This suggests that the local variations in the electronic structure and interatomic bonding at the core of a defect dominate its properties, as opposed to long-range elastic deformations. Across all the metals, we find that the relaxation volumes of vacancies and self-interstitial defects are correlated with atomic volumes, with values of -0.35 and 1.46 atomic volumes for a vacancy and a self-interstitial defect, respectively, providing a universally good approximation independent of the crystal structure. This study complements and completes the existing point defect databases spanning body-centred cubic and face-centred cubic metals.</p>

The samples present a well defined periodicity, as determined by X-ray reflectometry, whereas scanning transmission electron microscopy with local compositional analysis reveals that the superlattices present a modulation in composition instead of sharp interfaces. The policrystalline nature of the superlattices is evidenced both by X ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Magnetization measurements show a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for the higher Co concentrations. Picosecond acoustic experiments evidence that the studied samples support short-lived acoustic modes up to 900 GHz, and up to 7 acoustic echoes at lower this http URL are promising results for the development of magnetoacoustic devices working at ultrahigh frequencies.</p>

            <p>We numerically examine the dynamics of a probe particle driven at a constant force through an assembly of particles with competing long-range repulsion and short-range attraction that forms a bubble or stripe state. In the bubble regime, we identify several distinct types of motion, including an elastic or pinned regime where the probe particle remains inside a bubble and drags all other bubbles with it. There is also a plastic bubble phase where the bubble in which the probe particle is trapped is able to move past the adjacent bubbles. At larger drives, there is a breakthrough regime where the probe particle jumps from bubble to bubble, and in some cases, can induce correlated rotations or plastic rearrangements of the particles within the bubbles. At the highest drives, the probe particle moves sufficiently rapidly that the background particles undergo only small distortions. The distinctive dynamic flow states and the transitions between them are accompanied by signatures in the effective drag on the driven particle, jumps in the velocity-force curves, and changes in the time-dependent velocity fluctuations. We map the dynamic phase diagram for this system for varied interaction lengths, bubble sizes, and densities.</p>

            <p>In the crowded eukaryotic nucleus, euchromatin and heterochromatin segregate into distinct compartments, a phenomenon often attributed to homotypic interactions mediated by liquid liquid phase separation of chromatin associated proteins. Here, we revisit genome compartmentalization by examining the role of in vivo DNA packing density fluctuations driven by ATP dependent chromatin remodelers. Leveraging DNA accessibility data, we develop a polymer based model that captures these fluctuations and successfully reproduces genome wide compartment patterns observed in HiC data, without invoking homotypic interactions. Further analysis reveals that density fluctuations in a crowded nuclear environment elevate the system energy, while euchromatin heterochromatin segregation facilitates energy dissipation, offering a thermodynamic advantage for spontaneous compartment formation. These findings suggest that euchromatin heterochromatin segregation may arise through a non equilibrium, self organizing process, providing new insights into genome organization.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional multi-layer materials with an induced moiré pattern, either due to strain or relative twist between layers, provide a versatile platform for exploring strongly correlated and topological electronic phenomena. While these systems offer unprecedented tunability, their theoretical description remains challenging due to their complex atomic structures and large unit cells. A notable example is twisted bilayer graphene, where even the relevant symmetry group remains unsettled despite its critical role in constructing effective theories. Here, we focus on twisted bilayer graphene and use a combination of analytical methods, molecular dynamics simulations, and first-principles calculations to show that twisted atomic configurations with distinct microscopic symmetries converge to a universal interlayer structure that governs the low-energy physics. This emergent universality provides a robust foundation for symmetry-respecting models and offers insight into the role of commensurability in real twisted moiré systems.</p>

With this improvement, we can qualitatively reproduce the characteristic frequency structures of the full-vertex obtained by the numerically exact methods. In particular, the improved version of the simplified full-vertex captures a sharp value change in the cross structure.</p>

            <p>Knight shifts along the $b$ and $c$ axes ($K_b$ and $K_c$) at two crystallographically distinct Te sites were measured down to 70 mK using $^{125}$Te nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on an ultraclean UTe$_2$ single crystal with a superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ = 2.1 K. This was carried out to determine the $\boldsymbol{d}$-vector components, which are the order parameter in the spin-triplet pairing. Although the decrease in $K_b$ and $K_c$ is comparable to the theoretical estimation of the SC diamagnetic shielding effect, it is confirmed, by taking the difference between two Knight shifts at the distinct Te sites, that the spin susceptibility along the $b$ and $c$ axes decreases in the SC state.

The goal is to offer theoretical support for the advancement of electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cells. Our research has uncovered that BaHfO$_3$ demonstrates promising potential for proton conduction, with a low proton migration barrier of 0.28 eV, suggesting efficient proton conduction can be achieved at lower temperatures. Through A-site doping, particularly with low-valence state ions and the introduction of Ba vacancies, we can effectively decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies (Evac), leading to an increase in proton concentration. Additionally, our study reveals that the primary mechanism for proton migration in BaHfO$_3$ is the Grotthuss mechanism rather than the Vehicle mechanism. Examination of the changes in lattice parameters during proton migration indicates that while doping or vacancy control strategies do not alter the mode of H+ migration, they do influence the migration pathway and barrier. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the proton conduction properties of BaHfO$_3$ through A-site doping and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the development of novel, highly efficient Solid oxide fuel cell electrolyte materials.</p>

            <p>We embark on computing the longitudinal magnetoconductivity within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, where an isotropic triple-point semimetal (TSM) is subjected to collinear electric ($\boldsymbol E $) and magnetic ($\boldsymbol B$) fields. Except for the Drude part, the $B$-dependence arises exclusively from topological properties like the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment. We solve the Boltzmann equations exactly in the linear-response regime, applicable in the limit of weak/nonquantising magnetic fields. The novelty of our investigation lies in the consideration of the truly multifold character of the TSMs, where the so-called flat-band (flatness being merely an artifact of linear-order approximations) is made dispersive by incorporating the appropriate quadratic-in-momentum correction in the effective Hamiltonian. It necessitates the consideration of interband scatterings within the same node as well, providing a complex interplay of intraband, interband, intranode, and internode processes. The exact results are compared with those obtained from a naive relaxation-time approximation.</p>

            <p>Phononic frequency combs (PFCs) typically require nonlinear elastic media, limiting their frequency range and stability. Here, we propose a transformative approach to generate PFCs in purely linear elastic media by harnessing the magnon nonlinearities, offering a new paradigm for frequency comb physics. By tuning the magnon-phonon coupling confined in a magnetic disk of a vortex state into the strong coupling regime, we demonstrate an efficient nonlinearity transfer from magnons to phonons. This mechanism is able to produce GHz-range PFCs with comb spacing set by the vortex core's gyration frequency. Full micromagnetic simulations verify our theoretical predictions, confirming robust comb formation at 3.5 GHz with 0.4 GHz spacing. This approach overcomes the sub-MHz constraints of conventional PFCs, enabling applications in high-precision metrology, nanoscale sensing, and quantum technologies. Our findings also deepen the understanding of the nonlinear dynamics in hybrid magnon-phonon systems and provide a versatile platform for exploring frequency combs in diverse physical systems.</p>

In this work, we use first-principles calculations of the free-energy, incorporating both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results reveal a competition between metastable stacking orders of the reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers, which are energetically favored to form exclusively a triangular-hexagonal arrangement, allowing the possibility of competitive different domains and chiral order. Consistent with experimental observations, we find that the $2\times2\times2$ and $2\times2\times4$ modulations are nearly degenerate in free energy, and are abruptly melted into the high-symmetry hexagonal phase around 90 K. The transition is first-order but compatible with a measurable phonon-softening. Remarkably, even if the six-fold and inversion symmetry are intrinsically broken by the out-of-plane stacking, this does not lead to measurable anisotropy in the in-plane conductivity as suggested by measurements.</p>

            <h2>Composition dependent $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ band parameters for wurtzite (Al,Ga)N alloys from density functional theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amit Kumar Singh, Alvaro Gomez-Iglesias, Stefan Schulz</p>
            <p>UV emitters based on the semiconductor alloy aluminium gallium nitride, (Al,Ga)N, have attracted significant interest in recent years due to their potential for optoelectronic devices. To guide the design of such devices with improved efficiencies, theoretical frameworks based on so-called k.p methods have found widespread application in the literature. Given that k.p models are empirical in nature, parameters such as effective masses or crystal field splitting energies of (Al,Ga)N alloys have to be provided as input from first-principles calculations or experiment. Although these parameters are available for GaN and AlN, detailed information on their composition dependence is sparse. Here, we address this question and provide (Al,Ga)N band parameters for widely used k.p Hamiltonians. We start from density functional theory (DFT) to sample the electronic structure of (Al,Ga)N alloys over the full composition range. The k.p parameters are treated as free parameters to reproduce the DFT data. For GaN and AlN the parameters extracted here agree well with literature values. When turning to the composition dependence of the k.p parameters, our calculations show that most parameters deviate significantly from a linear interpolation of the GaN and AlN values, an approximation widely made in the literature. Moreover, to describe changes in the band parameters with Al content, composition dependent bowing parameters have to be considered for an accurate description of the DFT data. Finally, our analysis also provides initial insight into consequences of the nonlinear composition dependence of the k.p parameters for the electronic structure of (Al,Ga)N alloys. We find that in particular the band ordering is affected by the nonlinear evolution of the crystal field splitting energy with composition, an important aspect for the light polarization characteristics of high Al content (Al,Ga)N alloys.</p>

            <p>We present a response-augmented machine learning (ML) approach to the energetics of electrified metal surfaces. We leverage local descriptors to learn the work function as the first-order energy change to introduced bias charges and stabilize this learning through Born effective charges. This permits the efficient extension of ML interatomic potential architectures to include finite bias effects up to second-order. Application to OH at Cu(100) rationalizes the experimentally observed pH-dependence of the preferred adsorption site in terms of a non-Nernstian charge-induced site switching.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yilin Ye, Denis S. Grebenkov</p>
            <p>We investigate the boundary local time on polygonal boundaries such as finite generations of the Koch snowflake. To reveal the role of angles, we first focus on wedges and obtain the mean boundary local time, its variance, and the asymptotic behavior of its distribution. Moreover, we establish the coupled partial differential equations for higher-order moments. Next, we propose an efficient multi-scale Monte Carlo approach to simulate the boundary local time, as well as the escape duration and position of the associated reaction event on a polygonal boundary. This numerical approach combines the walk-on-spheres algorithm in the bulk with an approximate solution of the escape problem from a sector. We apply it to investigate how the statistics of the boundary local time depends on the geometric complexity of the Koch snowflake. Eventual applications to diffusion-controlled reactions on partially reactive boundaries, including the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability, are discussed.</p>

            <h2>Giant spontaneous polarization in zincblende III-V semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jesus Cañas, Mohamed Yassine, Oliver Ambacher</p>
            <p>The discovery of ferroelectricity in wurtzite nitrides has paved the way for measuring and understanding spontaneous polarization in III-V semiconductors. However, the calculation of polarization effects at heterointerfaces - crucial for numerous electronic and photonic applications - remains a topic of debate. The need for a reference structure to calculate spontaneous polarization has led to discussions over whether to use the zincblende or layered hexagonal structures as the reference for wurtzite crystals. In this work, we argue that the layered hexagonal structure is not only a better reference due to its vanishing formal polarization but also the only physically correct choice for the wurtzite system. This follows from the fact that spontaneous polarization is rigorously defined through the ferroelectric switching. Applying this definition, we extend our analysis to III-V zincblende semiconductors and reveal that their spontaneous polarization is approximately three times larger than that of wurtzite, thereby refuting the longstanding assumption that it is zero. Through this example, we illustrate that spontaneous polarization is not inherently linked to charge density at interfaces.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-François Joanny, Joseph O. Indekeu</p>
            <p>In these Lecture Notes we aim at clarifying how soft matter physics, and herein notably statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics, can be engaged to understand and manipulate non-equilibrium systems consisting of numerous (microscopic) constituents that convert (chemical) energy to mechanical energy, or vice versa, and that are known as active matter. Hydrodynamic theory, vitally extended to include (anisotropic) active stress, provides an astonishingly successful scaffold for tackling the problem of spontaneous flow in active nematics, all the way to active turbulence. The laws of physics, nonchalantly tresspassing the border crossing between inanimate particle and living cell, are seen to perform cum laude in describing the bi-directional coupling between division and apoptosis on the one hand and mechanical stress on the other. Fluidization of cellular tissue by cell division is a conceptual leap in this arena. The active behavior of nematic tissues (cell extrusion, multilayer formation, ...) turns out to be controlled by topological defects in the orientational order. Playgrounds by excellence for exhibiting stress-growth coupling are multicellular spheroids serving as model tumors, and cysts used as stem cell factories for cell therapy. Finally, our study of villi and crypts in the intestine furnishes a synthesis of various concepts explored. Cell mechanical pressure and cell layer geometrical curvature turn out to provide the dynamical ingredients which, when coupled to the cell division rate, allow one to develop a physical theory of tissue morphology which hopefully will have practical impact on cancer research.</p>

            <h2>Density-Functional Green Function Theory: Dynamical exchange-correlation field in lieu of self-energy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Aryasetiawan</p>
            <p>The one-particle Green function of a many-electron system is traditionally formulated within the self-energy picture. A different formalism was recently proposed, in which the self-energy is replaced by a dynamical exchange-correlation field, which acts on the Green function locally in both space and time. It was found that there exists a fundamental quantity, referred to as the dynamical exchange-correlation hole, which can be interpreted as effective density fluctuations induced in a many-electron system when a hole or an electron is introduced into the system, as in photoemission and inverse photoemission experiments. The dynamical exchange-correlation potential is simply the Coulomb potential of this exchange-correlation hole, which fulfils a sum rule and an exact constraint, identical to those satisfied by the static exchange-correlation hole in density-functional theory. The proposed formalism has been applied to a number of model systems such as the half-filled one-dimensional Hubbard model, the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, and the single-impurity Anderson model. The dynamical exchange-correlation hole and field of the homogeneous electron gas have also been studied with the view of constructing a density-functional approximation such as the local-density approximation. The availability of simple but accurate approximations for the exchange-correlation potential would circumvent costly computations of the traditional self-energy. The formalism may also provide new perspectives and insights into the many-body problem.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Louis Lehmann, Maximilian R. Becker, Lucas Tepper, Alexander P. Fellows, Álvaro Díaz Duque, Martin Thämer, Roland R. Netz</p>
            <p>The interpretation of sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions for multipole contributions. The previously unknown magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by the bulk media but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework that predicts the full set of multipole contributions to the SFG spectrum. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole contribution is of an intensity similar to the magnetic dipole contribution, and both are dominated by the electric quadrupole contribution. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be responsible for the mysterious shoulder at 3600 cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, subtracting the multipole contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.</p>

            <p>Quaternary mixed-metal M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 chalcohalides are an emerging material class for photovoltaic absorbers that combines the beneficial optoelectronic properties of lead-based halide perovskites with the stability of metal chalcogenides. Inspired by the recent discovery of lead-free mixed-metal chalcohalides materials, we utilized a combination of density functional theory and machine learning to determine compositional trends and chemical design rules in the lead-free and lead-based materials spaces. We explored a total of 54 M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 materials with M(II) = Sn, Pb, M(III) = In, Sb, Bi, Ch = S, Se, Te, and X = Cl, Br, I per phase (Cmcm, Cmc21 , and P21/c). The P21/c phase is the equilibrium phase at low temperatures, followed by Cmc21 and Cmcm. The fundamental band gaps in Cmcm and Cmc21 are smaller than those in P21/c, but direct band gaps are more common in Cmcm and Cmc21. The effective electron masses in P21/c are significantly larger compared to Cmcm and Cmc21, while the effective hole masses are nearly the same across all three phases. Using random forest regression, we found that the two electron acceptor sites (Ch and X) are crucial in shaping the properties of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds. Furthermore, the electron donor sites (M(II) and M(III)) can be used to finetune the material properties to desired applications. These design rules enable precise tailoring of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds for a variety of applications.</p>

            <p>The manipulation of material properties by laser light holds great promise for the development of future technologies. However, the full picture of the electronic response to laser driving remains to be uncovered. We present a novel approach to reveal details of the electron dynamics of laser-dressed materials, which consists of calculating and analysing the time-dependent partial density of states (PDOS) of materials during their interaction with a driving electromagnetic field. We show that the laser-dressed PDOS provides information about the structure of the bonds that form the laser-dressed electron density, analogous to the information that a PDOS can provide about the electron structure in a field-free case. We illustrate how our method can provide insights into the electron dynamics of materials in a site- and orbital-selective manner with calculations for a laser-dressed wurtzite ZnO crystal. Our work provides an analytical tool for the interpretation of subcycle-resolved experiments on laser-dressed materials and for the development of strategies for optical manipulation of material properties.</p>

            <h2>Yielding and memory in a driven mean-field model of glasses</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Makoto Suda, Edan Lerner, Eran Bouchbinder</p>
            <p>Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors inherited from their intrinsically-disordered, non-equilibrium nature. These include universal non-phononic vibrational spectra, and driven phenomena such as thermal and mechanical annealing, yielding transitions and memory formation, all linked to the underlying complex energy landscape of glasses. Yet, a unified theory of such diverse glassy phenomena is currently lacking. Here, we study a recently introduced mean-field model of glasses, shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. We show that the driven mean-field model, admitting a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of a collection of random-stiffness anharmonic oscillators with disordered interactions, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features a yielding transition as a function of the amplitude of the oscillatory driving force, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. We demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system. Finally, mechanical memory formation is demonstrated, in which memories can be stored in the model and subsequently extracted. Overall, the mean-field model offers a theoretical framework that unifies a broad range of glassy behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Diffusion with stochastic resetting on a lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander K. Hartmann, Satya N. Majumdar</p>
            <p>We provide an exact formula for the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to a target at the origin for a single particle diffusing on a $d$-dimensional hypercubic {\em lattice} starting from a fixed initial position $\vec R_0$ and resetting to $\vec R_0$ with a rate $r$. Previously known results in the continuous space are recovered in the scaling limit $r\to 0$, $R_0=|\vec R_0|\to \infty$ with the product $\sqrt{r}\, R_0$ fixed. However, our formula is valid for any $r$ and any $\vec R_0$ that enables us to explore a much wider region of the parameter space that are inaccessible in the continuum limit. For example, we have shown that the MFPT, as a function of $r$ for fixed $\vec R_0$, diverges in the two opposite limits $r\to 0$ and $r\to \infty$ with a unique minimum in between, provided the starting point is not a nearest neighbour of the target. In this case, the MFPT diverges as a power law $\sim r^{\phi}$ as $r\to \infty$, but very interestingly with an exponent $\phi= (|m_1|+|m_2|+\ldots +|m_d|)-1$ that depends on the starting point $\vec R_0= a\, (m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_d)$ where $a$ is the lattice spacing and $m_i$'s are integers. If, on the other hand, the starting point happens to be a nearest neighbour of the target, then the MFPT decreases monotonically with increasing $r$, approaching a universal limiting value $1$ as $r\to \infty$, indicating that the optimal resetting rate in this case is infinity. We provide a simple physical reason and a simple Markov-chain explanation behind this somewhat unexpected universal result. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations on lattices up to $50$ dimensions. Finally, in the absence of a target, we also compute exactly the position distribution of the walker in the nonequlibrium stationary state that also displays interesting lattice effects not captured by the continuum theory.</p>

            <p>Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.</p>

            <p>Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a promising material for electronic applications due to their easy fabrication and interesting semiconductor properties. Further, CQDs exhibit quantum confinement and charging effects, which may lead not only to improved performances but also to devices with novel functionalities.

Remarkably, the current-voltage characteristics show strongly nonlinear regimes at room temperature, ranging from Schottky diode to Coulomb blockade and even negative differential conductance behavior. We propose a master equation theoretical framework which allows us to compute current curves that agree well with the observations. This model emphasizes the importance of interacting dots and electron traps in generating a cohesive picture that encompasses all transport regimes.

The spectrum of non-modulated martensite was similar to that of austenite, albeit with increasing disorder due to excess Mn. In 10M modulated martensite, the main lines were split. The splitting is ascribed to structural modulation and quantitative analysis shows that the amplitude of modulation evolves with temperature and its magnitude is in agreement with diffraction data.</p>

            <p>Predicting and explaining charge carrier transport in halide perovskites is a formidable challenge because of the unusual vibrational and electron-phonon coupling properties of these materials. This study explores charge carrier transport in two prototypical halide perovskite materials, MAPbBr$_3$ and MAPbI$_3$, using a dynamic disorder model. Focusing on the role of real-space transport channels, we analyze temporal orbital occupations to assess the impact of material-specific on-site energy levels and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strengths. Our findings reveal that both on-site energies and SOC magnitude significantly influence the orbital occupation dynamics, thereby affecting charge dispersal and carrier mobility. In particular, energy gaps across on-site levels and the halide SOC strength govern the filling of transport channels over time. This leads us to identify the $pp\pi$ channel as a critical bottleneck for charge transport and to provide insights into the differences between electron and hole transport across the two materials.</p>

            <p>The dynamics of phase-separated interfaces shape the behavior of both passive and active condensates. While surface tension in equilibrium systems minimizes interface length, non-equilibrium fluxes can destabilize flat or constantly curved interfaces, giving rise to complex interface morphologies. Starting from a minimal model that couples a conserved, phase-separating species to a self-generated chemical field, we identify the conditions under which interfacial instabilities may emerge. Specifically, we show that non-reciprocal chemotactic interactions induce two distinct types of instabilities: a stationary (non-oscillatory) instability that promotes interface deformations, and an oscillatory instability that can give rise to persistent capillary waves propagating along the boundaries of phase-separated domains. To characterize these phenomena, we develop a perturbative framework that predicts the onset, wavelength, and velocity of capillary waves, and quantitatively validate these predictions through numerical simulations. Beyond the linear regime, our simulations reveal that capillary waves undergo a secondary instability, leading to either stationary or dynamically evolving superpositions of different wave modes. Finally, we investigate whether capillary waves can facilitate directed mass transport, either along phase boundaries (conveyor belts) or through self-sustained liquid gears crawling along a solid wall. Taken together, our results establish a general framework for interfacial dynamics in active phase-separating systems and suggest new strategies for controlling mass transport in soft matter and biological condensates.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen uptake into body-centered cubic (bcc) iron as a root cause for subsequent hydrogen embrittlement, is initiated at the surface. In this paper, we quantify how readily H diffuses from the surface into the bulk. We consider a set of low-index, vicinal and general Fe surfaces and treat H-permeation as a two-step process. First, density-functional calculations determine the adsorption energy of an isolated H atom at every crystallographically distinct surface site. Second, for each adsorption site we map the minimum-energy pathway that carries the atom beneath the surface and into the lattice. Across all ten orientations studied, a clear trend emerges: sites that bind hydrogen most weakly (highest adsorption energy) are the starting point of the lowest-barrier diffusion channels into the metal interior. Thus, the least-favorable adsorption pockets act as gateways for efficient subsurface penetration. These insights provide a practical design rule: suppressing or minimizing exposure of such high-energy adsorption motifs - through appropriate surface texturing or orientation control - should make bcc-iron components less susceptible to hydrogen uptake and the associated embrittlement.</p>

            <p>Charge carrier mobilities are critical parameters in halide perovskite solar cells, governing their average carrier velocity under an applied electric field and overall efficiency. Recent advances in first-principles calculations of electron-phonon interactions and carrier mobilities have enabled predictive computations for perovskite solar cells. However, the flexible octahedral frameworks and cationic displacements in these materials challenge the harmonic approximation, leading to significant difficulties in accurately calculating transport properties. To address these issues, we combine temperature-dependent effective potentials with the ab initio Boltzmann transport equations to compute carrier mobilities in a representative lead-free perovskite, CsSnBr$_3$. At room temperature, the electron/hole Hall mobilities in CsSnBr$_3$ are 106/256 cm$^2$/Vs when neglecting anharmonic effects and 59/145 cm$^2$/Vs when included. This overestimation of the harmonic approximation arises from the neglect of scattering coming from soft modes. We provide a workflow for performing first-principles carrier mobility calculations in anharmonic systems, advancing the predictive modeling of perovskite solar cells.</p>

            <p>In this letter we consider the time dependent Kondo model where a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons through a time dependent interaction strength $J(t)$. Using the Bethe ansatz framework, an exact solution to the time dependent Schrodinger equation is constructed. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation which relates the amplitudes corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles in the configuration space. This constraint equation takes the form of a matrix difference equation, and the associated consistency conditions restrict the interaction strength $J(t)$ for the system to be integrable. For a given $J(t)$ satisfying these constraints, the solution to the matrix difference equations provides the exact many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The framework developed in this work is general and provides a method to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.</p>

Meaningful interpretation and analysis of the Auger parameter of these materials have been hindered due to, among other reasons, the absence of reliable references. Here we present a comprehensive study of Auger parameters for TiN and AlN thin films using a dual-source lab-based XPS/HAXPES system equipped with Al Ka and Cr Ka x-ray sources. Due to a large spread of excitation x-ray energy, bulk- and surface-sensitive core-level photoelectrons and Auger transitions are probed. This allows us to study a wide range of Auger and core-level emission lines of TiN and AlN. These measurements can serve as references for further identification of chemical state changes, oxidation state or any deviations in the local chemical environment in these materials. UHV sample transfer was employed to minimise surface contamination.

Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</p>

            <h2>Structure and Elastic properties of Titanium MXenes: evaluation of COMB3, REAXFF and MEAM force fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis F. V. Thomazini, Alexandre F. Fonseca</p>
            <p>Titanium carbide and nitride MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic materials that exhibit noteworthy physical and chemical properties. These materials are considered for a variety of technological applications, ranging from energy harvesting to optical and biomedical applications. Given the growing interest in titanium MXenes, there is an expanding demand for computational studies to predict physical properties and behaviors under diverse physical conditions. Complex and large-scale systems necessitate computational methodologies that surpass the constraints imposed by ab initio calculations. In this regard, it is imperative to ascertain the reliability of the computational tools employed to simulate and predict the physical properties of titanium MXenes. In this study, the ability of three known classical molecular dynamics (MD) potentials to provide the structural and elastic properties of titanium carbide and nitride MXenes is evaluated. The MD potentials that were the focus of this study include the Charge-Optimized Many-Body (COMB3), the Reactive Force Field (REAXFF) and the Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM). These three potentials possess two or more sets of parameters, herein referred to as force fields, capable of simulating Ti-C and Ti-N systems. The MD results for the lattice parameter and thickness of the MXenes are then compared to those from DFT calculations found in the literature. A total of ten force fields were considered; of these, two REAXFF and two MEAM ones were identified as the most adequate to simulate both the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes. Additionally, the values for the linear compressibility of MXenes are presented for the first time. Consequently, researchers can utilize the obtained results to design novel MD-based computational studies of titanium MXenes, leveraging the established relative validity of the available force fields.</p>

            <h2>Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of random transverse-field Ising chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Róbert Juhász</p>
            <p>Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground states of clusters are either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. An interesting consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, these phases are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an a posteriori justification of the assumption on the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point tacitly used in earlier works, and also refine the functional form of its vanishing at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$ asymptotically as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the time-dependent density of defects accumulated during the annealing process at intermediate times.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pei-Hao Fu, Sayan Mondal, Jun-Feng Liu, Yukio Tanaka, Jorge Cayao</p>
            <p>We consider unconventional magnets with and without spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity and demonstrate the emergence of spin triplet states due to light drives. In particular, we find that a high-frequency linearly polarized light drive induces a spin-triplet density in $d$-wave altermagnets which does not exist in the static regime and can directly reveal the strength of the altermagnetic field. In this high-frequency regime, we also show that linearly polarized light enables the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet superconducting correlations possessing $d$-wave and $s$-wave parities, which can be controlled by the light drive and accessed by measuring the spin density. Moreover, for low-frequency linearly and circularly polarized light drives, we obtain that the types of superconducting correlations are broadened due to the presence of Floquet bands, enabling spin-triplet pairs in $d$- and $p$-wave unconventional magnets, which are absent in the undriven phase.</p>

            <p>Spatio-temporal scaling dynamics connected to non-thermal fixed points has been suggested as a universal framework to describe the relaxation of isolated far-from-equilibrium systems. Experimental studies in weakly-interacting cold atom systems have found scaling dynamics connected to specific attractors. In our experiments, we study a quantum gas of strongly interacting $^6$Li$_2$ Feshbach molecules, brought far out of equilibrium by imprinting a white-noise phase profile. The observed relaxation follows the same universal dynamics as for the previously observed formation of the order parameter in a shock-cooled gas of weakly interacting $^{87}$Rb atoms. Our results point to a single universal fixed point with a large basin of attraction governing the relaxation of quasi-1D bosonic systems, independent of their specific initial conditions and microscopic details.</p>

            <h2>Biaxial characterization of soft elastomers: experiments and data-adaptive configurational forces for fracture</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel Angel Moreno-Mateos, Simon Wiesheier, Ali Esmaeili, Mokarram Hossain, Paul Steinmann</p>
            <p>Understanding the fracture mechanics of soft solids remains a fundamental challenge due to their complex, nonlinear responses under large deformations. While multiaxial loading is key to probing their mechanical behavior, the role of such loading in fracture processes is still poorly understood. Here, we present a combined experimental-computational framework to investigate fracture in soft elastomers under equi-biaxial loading. We report original equi-biaxial quasi-static experiments on five elastomeric materials, revealing a spectrum of material and fracture behavior, from brittle-like to highly deformable response with crack tip strains exceeding 150 %. Motivated by these observations, we develop a hybrid computational testbed that mirrors the experimental setup and enables virtual biaxial tests. Central to this framework are two components: a data-adaptive formulation of hyperelastic energy functions that flexibly captures material behavior, and a post-processing implementation of the Configurational Force Method, providing a computationally efficient estimate of the J-integral at the crack tip. Our data-adaptive framework for hyperelastic energy functions proves versatility to capture with high accuracy the hyperelastic behavior observed in the biaxial experiments. This is important because accurately capturing the constitutive behaviour of soft solids is key for a reliable application of the Configurational Force Method to soft solids. In the limit of crack onset, a critical value of the crack tip configurational force allows for a criterion of fracture toughness. Together, our experimental, theoretical, and computational contributions offer a new paradigm for characterizing and designing soft materials with tailored fracture properties.</p>

            <h2>Dynamics of Clusters of Anyons in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianhui Xu, Guangyue Ji, Yuzhu Wang, Ha Quang Trung, Bo Yang</p>
            <p>We investigates the effective interactions between anyons emerging from either model or realistic bare electron-electron (e-e) interactions in Laughlin and Moore-Read fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids. Instead of being purely repulsive or attractive, such anyons display rich dynamics with interesting experimental consequences. Two Laughlin anyons prefer to form bound states with short-range e-e interactions, leading to $2e/3$ bunched quasiholes at low temperatures instead of the $e/3$ quasiholes. In non-Abelian Moore-Read FQH phases, two $e/4$ quasiholes can fuse into topologically distinct ''1'' or ''$\psi$'' anyons that are no longer degenerate with realistic two-body e-e interactions. This suggests the possibility to energetically separate and manipulate the two types of anyons by tuning the bare electron-electron interactions. We propose that the recently developed high-resolution STM measurements can be used to probe effective anyon interactions when anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The local density of states from various bound states of anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.</p>

            <p>In this study, the comparative efficiency of different electrochemical advanced oxidation processes, such as anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H2O2 (AO- H2O2), electro-Fenton (EF), and its combination with UV irradiation (photoelectron-Fenton (PEF)), was investigated for the removal of methylparaben (MP) using a carbon felt cathode and a boron-doped diamond anode. The EF process achieved a higher MP removal efficiency than the AO-H2O2 process for all applied current densities. The total organic carbon (TOC) removal after 6 h of treatment at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 reached 75.0% and 91.9% for the AO- H2O2 and EF processes, respectively. The combination of EF and UV light improved the efficiency of the EF process. The PEF process achieved a TOC removal of 84.6% in only 2 h at 5 mA cm-2 and 96.8% after 6 h of treatment. Furthermore, based on identifying oxidation reaction intermediates and short-chain carboxylic acids generated during the treatment, a reaction pathway for methylparaben mineralization by hydroxyl radicals was proposed.</p>

            <p>The speed of information propagation in long-range interacting quantum systems is limited by Lieb-Robinson-type bounds, whose tightness can be established by finding specific quantum state-transfer protocols. Previous works have given quantum state-transfer protocols that saturate the corresponding Lieb-Robinson bounds using time-dependent Hamiltonians. Are speed limits for quantum information propagation different for time-independent Hamiltonians? In a step towards addressing this question, we present and analyze two optimal time-independent state-transfer protocols for free-particle systems, which utilize continuous-time single-particle quantum walks with hopping strength decaying as a power law. We rigorously prove and numerically confirm that our protocols achieve quantum state transfer, with controllable error over an arbitrarily long distance in any spatial dimension, at the speed limits set by the free-particle Lieb-Robinson bounds. This shows that time independence does not limit information flow for long-range free-particle Hamiltonians.</p>

            <h2>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qianxu Wang, Sara Magdalena Gómez, Juan S. Salcedo-Gallo, Roy Leibovitz, Jake Freeman, Salil Bedkihal, Mattias Fitzpatrick</p>
            <p>Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohith Sajith, Zijian Song, Brenden Roberts, Varun Menon, Yabo Li</p>
            <p>We propose protocols to implement non-Clifford logical gates between stabilizer codes by entangling into a non-Abelian topological order as an intermediate step. Generalizing previous approaches, we provide a framework that generates a large class of non-Clifford and non-diagonal logical gates between qudit surface codes by gauging the topological symmetry of symmetry-enriched topological orders. As our main example, we concretely detail a protocol that utilizes the quantum double of $S_3$ to generate a controlled-charge conjugation ($C\mathcal{C}$) gate between a qubit and qutrit surface code. Both the preparation of non-Abelian states and logical state injection between the Abelian and non-Abelian codes are executed via finite-depth quantum circuits with measurement and feedforward. We discuss aspects of the fault-tolerance of our protocol, presenting insights on how to construct a heralded decoder for the quantum double of $S_3.$ We also outline how analogous protocols can be used to obtain logical gates between qudit surface codes by entangling into $\mathcal{D}(G),$ where $G$ is a semidirect product of Abelian groups. This work serves as a step towards classifying the computational power of non-Abelian quantum phases beyond the paradigm of anyon braiding on near-term quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal conductivity \k{appa} comparable to that of diamond, yet experimental measurements have plateaued at ~1300W/mK. We report room-temperature \k{appa} exceeding 2000W/mK in c-BAs, on par with single-crystal diamond. This finding is enabled by high-quality single crystals and a newly developed nanosecond, transducer-less time-domain thermoreflectance technique that allows spatial mapping of \k{appa} without metal transducers. Thermal conductivity correlates with crystal quality, as evidenced by stronger photoluminescence and longer photoluminescence lifetimes. However, the observed nanosecond lifetimes remain shorter than expected for an indirect bandgap semiconductor, suggesting room for further crystal quality improvement and higher \k{appa}. These results challenge current theoretical models and highlight c-BAs as a promising material for next-generation electronics.</p>

            <h2>Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Naruo Ohga, Takuya Hatomura</p>
            <p>Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it effectively incorporates nonlocal information, and it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.</p>

            <p>Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</p>

            <p>This work demonstrates photon emission gain, i.e., emission of multiple photons per injected electron, through impact excitation in Er-doped silicon light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Conventional methods for exciting Er ions in silicon suffer from low efficiency due to mismatched energy transfer between exciton recombination and Er excitation. Here, we propose a reverse-biased Si PN junction diode where ballistically accelerated electrons induce inelastic collisions with Er ions, enabling tunable excitation via electric field modulation. Theoretical modeling reveals that photon emission gain arises from multiple impact excitations by a single electron traversing the electroluminescence region, with the gain value approximating the ratio of emission region width to electron mean free path, i.e., G = Lex/l. Experimental results show an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 1.84% at 78 K, representing a 20-fold enhancement over room-temperature performance. This work provides a critical foundation for on-chip integration of silicon-based communication-band lasers and quantum light sources.</p>

            <p>We compare the multipartite entangling and disentangling powers of unitary operators by assessing their ability to generate or eliminate genuine multipartite entanglement. Our findings reveal that while diagonal unitary operators can exhibit equal entangling and disentangling powers, certain non-diagonal unitaries demonstrate an imbalance when acting on fully separable states, thereby extending the known disparity from bipartite systems to those with any number of parties. Counterintuitively, we construct classes of unitaries and their adjoints that display unequal entanglement generation capacities, behaving differently when applied to systems with an even number of qubits compared to those with an odd number. Further, we illustrate that this asymmetry can be simulated using physically realizable Hamiltonians: systems with an even number of qubits employ nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, while those with an odd number utilize a combination of Heisenberg and DM interactions. Additionally, we present a circuit composed of random noncommuting unitaries, constructed from alternating layers of two-qubit Haar-random gates, to illustrate the discrepancy in the entangling and disentangling capabilities of unitaries.</p>

            <p>Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.</p>

            <p>We employ the linear response theory to calculate the polarization rate of heavy quark spin in the presence of a strong magnetic field and the hot QCD matter, both of which are simultaneously generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The hot QCD medium is simplified as a fermionic system consisting of only quarks. The spin of heavy quarks can be polarized as a result of combined contributions from spin-spin interactions between quarks and spin-magnetic field interactions. This spin dynamics is modeled as consisting of a polarization term and a dissipation term, which is described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation and widely studied in condensed matter physics, analogous to the momentum evolution in the Langevin equation. In this study, we calculate the Gilbert damping factor that characterizes the spin polarization rate of heavy quarks, considering a Coulomb potential between two fermions in the medium. The dependence of the heavy quark spin polarization rate on the strength of the magnetic field, the heavy quark mass, temperature, and baryon chemical potential is studied in detail. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of quark spin dynamics in the hot QCD medium and the magnetic field.</p>

            <p>The mechanical properties and long-term structural reliability of crystalline materials are strongly influenced by microstructural features such as grain size, morphology, and crystallographic texture. These characteristics not only determine the initial mechanical behavior but also govern the progression of degradation mechanisms, such as strain localization, fatigue damage, and microcrack initiation under service conditions. Variability in these microstructural attributes, introduced during manufacturing or evolving through in-service degradation, leads to uncertainty in material performance. Therefore, understanding and quantifying microstructure-sensitive plastic deformation is critical for assessing degradation risk in high-value mechanical systems. This study presents a first-of-its-kind machine learning-driven framework that couples high-fidelity crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) simulations with data-driven surrogate modeling to accelerate degradation-aware uncertainty quantification in welded structural alloys. Specifically, the impact of crystallographic texture variability in 316L stainless steel weldments, characterized via high-throughput electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), is examined through CPFE simulations on calibrated representative volume elements (RVEs). A polynomial chaos expansion-based surrogate model is then trained to efficiently emulate the CPFE response using only 200 simulations, reducing computational cost by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional Monte Carlo analysis. The surrogate enables rapid quantification of uncertainty in stress-strain behavior and identifies texture components such as Cube and Goss as key drivers of degradation-relevant plastic response.</p>

            <h2>The universality class of the first levels in low-dimensional gravity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Altland, Jeremy van der Heijden, Tobias Micklitz, Moshe Rozali, Joaquim Telles de Miranda</p>
            <p>We investigate the physics of a small group of quantum states defined above the sharply defined ground state of a chaotic ensemble. This `universality class of the first levels' (UFL) is realized in the majority of `synthetic' random matrix models but, for all we know, in only one microscopically defined system: low-dimensional gravity. We discuss the physical properties of these states, notably their exceptional rigidity against external perturbations, as quantified by the so-called quantum state fidelity. Examining these structures through the lenses of random matrix and string theory, we highlight their relevance to the physics of low-dimensional holographic principles.</p>

            <h2>An Ultra-Low Power and Fast Ising Machine using Voltage-Controlled Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yihao Zhang, Sai Li, Albert Lee, Zheng Zhu, Lang Zeng, Peng Wang, Lei Gao, Di Wu, Weisheng Zhao</p>
            <p>Physics-inspired computing paradigms, such as Ising machines, are emerging as promising hardware alternatives to traditional von Neumann architectures for tackling computationally intensive combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). While quantum, optical, and electronic devices have garnered significant attention for their potential in realizing Ising machines, their translation into practical systems for industry-relevant applications remains challenging, with each approach facing specific limitations in power consumption and speed. To address this challenge, we report the first chip-level spintronic Ising machine using voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory. The core of our design leverages magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) driven by the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect to realize the probabilistic update of Ising spins through a new mechanism. It enables a latency below 1 ns and an energy consumption under 40 fJ per spin update, achieving a 1000-times improvement over previous current-driven MTJ-based implementations. We map two real-world COPs in electronic design automation-global routing and layer assignment-onto the Ising model and demonstrate high-quality results with an energy efficiency of 25000 solutions per second per watt. This outperforms state-of-the-art quantum and graphics processing units by six and seven orders of magnitude, respectively. These results establish voltage-controlled spintronics as a compelling route towards next-generation physics-inspired machine intelligence, offering a paradigm for ultra-low-power, high-speed, and scalable computation.</p>

            <p>The simplicity of encoding a qubit in the state of a single electron spin and the potential for their integration into industry-standard microchips continue to drive the field of semiconductor-based quantum computing. However, after decades of progress, validating universal logic in these platforms has advanced little beyond first-principles demonstrations of meeting the DiVincenzo criteria. Case in point, and specifically for silicon-based quantum dots, three-qubit algorithms have been the upper limit to date, despite the availability of devices containing more qubits. In this work, we fully exploit the capacity of a spin-qubit array and implement a six qubit quantum circuit, the largest utilizing semiconductor quantum technology. By programming the quantum processor, we execute quantum circuits across all permutations of three, four, five, and six neighbouring qubits, demonstrating successful programmable multi-qubit operation throughout the array. The results reveal that, despite the high quality of individual units, errors quickly accumulate when combining all of them in a quantum circuit. This work highlights the necessity to minimize idling times through simultaneous operations, boost dephasing times, and consistently improve state preparation and measurement fidelities.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation Revisited</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Morteza Nattagh Najafi, Fatemeh Foroughirad</p>
            <p>We investigate the space time fractional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (FNLSE) incorporating the modified Riemann Liouville derivative introduced by Jumari. The equation is characterized by two parameters: the fractional derivative parameter (alpha, which captures the memory effects) and the non linearity parameter a. We present analytical solutions via three complementary approaches: the fractional Riccati method, the Adomian decomposition method, and the scaling method. The FNLSE is formulated in terms of generalized Hamiltonian and momentum operators, allowing a unified framework to explore various solution structures. A continuity equation is derived, and a general class of solutions based on Mittag Leffler (ML) plane waves is proposed, from which generalized momentum and energy eigenvalues are systematically classified. Utilizing a generalized Wick rotation, we establish a connection between the FNLSE and a fractional Fokker Planck equation governing a dual stochastic process, revealing links to Q Gaussian statistics. Through separation of variables, we classify a family of solutions including chiral ML plane waves. Additionally, we construct Riccati type bright and dark solitons and assess their stability using a dynamical distance metric. As alpha changes, i.e. the memory effects are tuned, the bright solitons transform to dark solitons, which is equivalent to focusing defocusing transition. A series solution is developed via the Adomian decomposition technique, applied to both chiral and plane wave cases. Finally, we reduce the dimensionality of the FNLSE using the scaling arguments, leading to self similar solutions, and find pure phase as well as Adomian type solutions. Our results highlight the rich analytical landscape of the FNLSE and provide insights into its underlying physical and mathematical structure.</p>

            <p>The study analyzes open hole carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP laminates modified with electrospun interleaves containing Diels Alder-based self-healing agents. It develops a high-fidelity simulation framework to investigate the quasistatic tensile behavior of these composites. The study uses Hashin's failure criteria to capture intralaminar damage and surface-based cohesive contact interactions to model interlaminar delamination. Two interleave configurations are examined: solution electrospinning (SEP) for full thickness coverage and melt electrospinning (MEP) for localized reinforcement. Results show good agreement with experimental data, capturing key failure mechanisms like matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and delamination. The study emphasizes the importance of spatially resolved cohesive properties and meshing strategies in accurately simulating damage progression.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jean-Baptiste Camps, Julien Randon-Furling, Ulysse Godreau</p>
            <p>Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Bernazzani, Balázs Gulácsi, Guido Burkard</p>
            <p>We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is universal. That is, it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term, as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. By considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we also derive the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudomodes for quantum environments.</p>

            <h2>Spin-qubit readout analysis based on a Hidden Markov Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maria Spethmann, Peter Stano, Daniel Loss</p>
            <p>Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal pre-filtering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of `hot' spin qubits.</p>

            <p>We present a matrix-product-state-based numerical approach for simulating systems composed of several qubits and a common one-dimensional waveguide. In the presented approach, the one-dimensional waveguide is modeled in real space. Thus, one can use the advantage of matrix-product states that are suited for simulating low-entangled one-dimensional systems. The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach by simulating superradiant phenomena within the Hamiltonian dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akiyoshi Tomihari, Ryo Karakida</p>
            <p>The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</p>

            <p>For the general class of quasifree fermionic right mover/left mover systems over the infinitely extended two-sided discrete line introduced in [8] within the algebraic framework of quantum statistical mechanics, we study the von Neumann entropy of a contiguous subsystem of finite length in interaction with its environment. In particular, under the assumption of spatial translation invariance, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the von Neumann entropy for large subsystem lengths and prove that its leading order density is, in general, nonvanishing and displays the signature of a mixture of the independent thermal species underlying the right mover/left mover system. As special cases, the formalism covers so-called nonequilibrium steady states, thermal equilibrium states, and ground states. Moreover, for general Fermi functions, we derive a necessary and sufficient criterion for the von Neumann entropy density to vanish.</p>

            <h2>Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gen Kimura, Aina Mayumi, Haruki Yamashita</p>
            <p>We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation, which explicitly depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum state. The conventional constant 1/4 is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient with the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator. This coefficient is optimal among all Robertson-type generalizations and does not admit further improvement. Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. In addition, our result provides a strict generalization of the Schroedinger uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus, thereby generalizing the Arthurs-Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.</p>

The effective action formalism is applied such that the quantum corrections are examined in one loop to the scalar effective potential as function of the classical field, of the Lee-Wick mass, and also of the coupling constants of this model. The instability of the effective potential is investigated due to Lee-Wick mass.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marc Duran-Sala, Martin Hendrick, Gabriele Manoli</p>
            <p>Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.</p>

            <p>Biomolecular crystals, such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins, have emerged as potential next generation piezoelectric materials due to their low-cost, biocompatibility, eco-friendliness, and reduced permittivity versus ceramics. However, many challenges have limited their acceleration into mainstream sensing applications. Their natural self-assembly from saturated solutions into polycrystalline films reduces their effective piezoelectric output, and results in high variability within individual samples, and across sample batches when scaled-up. Here we validate the sublimation of a variety of amino acids onto conductive substrates as an effective technique for overcoming these challenges. This solvent-free crystallisation technique results in polycrystalline films with uniformly orientated crystals, and a resulting piezoelectric response that exceeds that of single crystals. We report a maximum piezoelectric response of 9.6 pC/N in films of L-Valine, which matches the predicted single crystal response, and a maximum voltage output of 4.6 V. For L-Methionine and L-Valine sublimated films the material properties are consistent at all points on the piezoelectric films and repeatable across any number of films grown under the same conditions.</p>

A recent proposal in arXiv:2305.1360(6) simplifies this task by considering the soliton in a bounded region and relating the $\eta$ invariant, and thus the fermion number, to a specific heat kernel coefficient and to contributions from the edge states. We test this method in a system of charged fermions living on an Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortex background. We show that the resulting $\eta$ invariant is independent of boundary conditions, confirming the validity of the method. Our analysis reveals a nontrivial feature for the fermionic spectrum in the vortex-induced Higgs phase. As a by-product, we also find that for a vortex living on a disk, the edge states carry fractional charge.</p>

            <p>Shortly after the discovery of topological band insulators, the topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) have also been theoretically predicted. The latter has ignited revival interest in the properties of Kondo insulators. Currently, the feasibility of topological nature in SmB$_6$ has been intensively analyzed by several complementary probes. Here by starting with a minimal-orbital Anderson lattice model, we explore the local electronic structure in a Kondo insulator. We show that the two strong topological regimes sandwiching the weak topological regime give rise to a single Dirac cone, which is located near the center or corner of the surface Brillouin zone. We further find that, when a single impurity is placed on the surface, low-energy resonance states are induced in the weak scattering limit for the strong TKI regimes and the resonance level moves monotonically across the hybridization gap with the strength of impurity scattering potential; while low energy states can only be induced in the unitary scattering limit for the weak TKI regime, where the resonance level moves universally toward the center of the hybridization gap. These impurity induced low-energy quasiparticles will lead to characteristic signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, which has recently found success in probing into exotic properties in heavy fermion systems.</p>

            <p>Topological superconductivity is expected to spur Majorana zero modes -- exotic states that are also considered a quantum technology asset. Fractional Josephson effect is their manifestation in electronic transport measurements, often under microwave irradiation. A fraction of induced resonances, known as Shapiro steps, should vanish, in a pattern that signifies the presence of Majorana modes. Here we report patterns of Shapiro steps expected in topological Josephson junctions, such as the missing first Shapiro step, or several missing odd-order steps. But our junctions, which are InAs quantum wells with Al contacts, are studied near zero magnetic field, meaning that they are not in the topological regime. We also observe other patterns such as missing even steps and several missing steps in a row, not relevant to topological superconductivity. Potentially responsible for our observations is rounding of not fully developed steps superimposed on non-monotonic resistance versus voltage curves, but several origins may be at play. Our results demonstrate that any single pattern, even striking, cannot uniquely identify topological superconductivity, and a multifactor approach is necessary to unambiguously establish this important phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Periodic plasmonic arrays making possible excitations of surface lattice resonances (SLRs) or quasi-resonant features are of great importance for biosensing and other applications. Fabrication of such arrays over a large area is typically very costly and time-consuming when performed using conventional electron beam lithography and other methods, which reduce application prospects. Here, we propose a technique of double femtosecond pulse (~ 170 fs) laser-assisted structuring of thin (~ 32 nm) Au films deposited on a glass substrate and report a single-step fabrication of homogeneous and highly ordered Au-based Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) over a large area. Our experimental results unveil the key importance of the interpulse delay as the determining factor rendering possible the homogeneity of laser induced structures and confirm that highly ordered, functional LIPSS occur solely upon double pulse irradiation under a specific interpulse delay range. A theoretical investigation complements experimental results providing remarkable insights on the structure formation mechanism. Ellipsometric measurements show that such LIPSS structures can exhibit highly valuable plasmonic features in light reflection. In particular, we observed ultranarrow resonances associated with diffraction-coupled SLRs, which are of paramount importance for biosensing and other applications. The presented data suggest that femtosecond double pulse structuring of thin metal films can serve as a valuable and low-cost tool for a large-scale fabrication of highly ordered functional elements and structures.</p>

            <p>The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which asserts that every eigenstate of a many-body quantum system is indistinguishable from a thermal ensemble, plays a pivotal role in understanding thermalization of isolated quantum systems. Yet, no evidence has been obtained as to whether the ETH holds for all few-body operators in a chaotic system; such few-body operators include key quantities in statistical mechanics, such as the total magnetization, the momentum distributions, and their low-order thermal and quantum fluctuations. Here, we formulate a conjecture that for a generic nonintegrable system the ETH holds for all $m$-body operators with $m < {\alpha}_{\ast} N$ in the thermodynamic limit for some nonzero constant ${\alpha}_{\ast} > 0$. We first prove this statement for systems with Haar-distributed energy eigenstates to analytically motivate our conjecture. We then verify the conjecture for generic spin, Bose, and Fermi systems with local and few-body interactions by large-scale numerical calculations. Our results imply that generic systems satisfy the ETH for all few-body operators, including their thermal and quantum fluctuations.</p>

The effective magnetic field consists of two parts: (a) an actual/physical magnetic field $\mathbf B $, and (b) an emergent magnetic field $\mathbf B_5 $ which quantifies the elastic deformations of the sample. $\mathbf B_5 $ is an axial pseudomagnetic field because it couples to conjugate nodal points with opposite chiralities with opposite signs. We study the interplay of the orientations of these two components of $\mathbf B^{\rm tot}$ with respect to the direction of the electric field (or temperature gradient) and elucidate how it affects the characteristics involving the chirality of the node. Additionally, we show that the magnitude and sharpness of the conductivity tensor profiles strongly depend on the value of the topological charge at the node in question.</p>

            <p>Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum technologies, including quantum metrology and sensing. A promising strategy for the achievement of high sensitivity to external fields relies on the exploitation of large ensembles of NV centers, whose fabrication by ion implantation is upper limited by the amount of radiation damage introduced in the diamond lattice. In this works we demonstrate an approach to increase the density of NV centers upon the high-fluence implantation of MeV N2+ ions on a hot target substrate (>550 °C). Our results show that, with respect to room-temperature implantation, the high-temperature process increases the vacancy density threshold required for the irreversible conversion of diamond to a graphitic phase, thus enabling to achieve higher density ensembles. Furthermore, the formation efficiency of color centers was investigated on diamond substrates implanted at varying temperatures with MeV N2+ and Mg+ ions revealing that the formation efficiency of both NV centers and magnesium-vacancy (MgV) centers increases with the implantation temperature.</p>

            <h2>Topological transport of vorticity on curved magnetic membranes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chau Dao, Ji Zou, Eric Kleinherbers, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak</p>
            <p>In this work, we study the transport of vorticity on curved dynamical two-dimensional magnetic membranes. We find that topological transport can be controlled by geometrically reducing symmetries, enabling processes absent from flat magnetic systems. To this end, the vorticity 3-current is constructed, which obeys a continuity equation immune to local disturbances of the magnetic texture and spatiotemporal fluctuations of the membrane. We show how electric current can manipulate vortex transport in geometrically nontrivial magnetic systems. As an illustrative example, we propose a minimal setup that realizes an experimentally feasible energy storage device and discuss its thermodynamic efficiency in terms of a vortexoelectric counterpart of the thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$.</p>

            <p>We present results of a Raman scattering study of the Kagome ferromagnet Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, with a focus on electronic and phononic excitations and their interplay. We provide a theoretical analysis of the electronic band structure, enabling a semi-quantitative explanation of the spectra. A prominent feature in the electronic spectra is a redistribution of spectral weight from low to high energies in all polarization configurations starting at the Curie temperature T$_C$. In the symmetry-resolved spectra, the suppression of the A$_{1g}$ continuum in the ferromagnetic state arises from the redistribution of electronic states below T$_C$, while a strong enhancement of the A$_{2g}$ continuum is linked to the dynamics of fermions near the Fermi level $E_{\rm F}$ being characterized by spin-momentum locking near Weyl points. The A$_{1g}$ phonon modulates the position of these Weyl points and couples strongly to the related fermions close to $E_{\rm F}$. These results allow a comprehensive understanding of the bulk band structure evolution as a function of temperature in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$, offering key insights for further studies of the driving force behind the long-range magnetic order and novel topological states in this compound.</p>

            <h2>Macroscopic Irreversibility in Quantum Systems: Free Expansion in a Fermion Chain</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hal Tasaki</p>
            <p>We consider a free fermion chain with uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and let it evolve from an arbitrary initial state with a fixed macroscopic number of particles. We then prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the measured coarse-grained density distribution is almost uniform with (quantum mechanical) probability extremely close to one. This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior, i.e., a ballistic diffusion, in a system governed by quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is conceptually important that irreversibility from any initial state is proved here without introducing any randomness to the initial state or the Hamiltonian, while the known examples, both classical and quantum, rely on certain randomness or apply to limited classes of initial states. The essential new ingredient in the proof is the large deviation bound for every energy eigenstate, which is reminiscent of the strong ETH (energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis).</p>

            <p>The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and W$X_3$ ($X$= Cl, Br, I) have isolated nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$ and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in these materials are comparable with those in moiré systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luca Maranzana, Naoto Nagaosa, Sergey Artyukhin</p>
            <p>In spiral multiferroics, magnetism induces ferroelectricity, thus holding a promise for novel memory devices where an electric field switches magnetic bits. However, such a switching process, in which magnetic domain walls are moved electrically, is still poorly understood. We find multiferroic domain walls containing arrays of meron (half-skyrmion) strings with a plethora of topological defects, which profoundly affect wall dynamics. Minimum energy walls have alternating meron topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with velocity limited by the magnon speed. During domain nucleation, walls with non-alternating meron charges appear. Such defects result in a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, and the wall mobility is suppressed. Meron strings possess 0D hedgehog defects, analogous to Bloch points, that pin the wall to the lattice. This fascinating interplay of magnetoelectric switching with a variety of topological defects and non-local spin dynamics opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of spins.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kwangmin Lee, Ryan C. Hurley</p>
            <p>Recent studies have established correlations between non-affine motion and macroscopic stress fluctuations in sheared granular media. However, a comprehensive examination of the relationship between non-affine motion, macroscopic stress fluctuations, and inter-particle forces remains lacking. We investigated this interplay in simulations of 2D granular media during stick-slip events under plane shear. We found that, during most large slip events, particles with the greatest non-affine motion, as quantified by D2min, initially coalesce into one or two dominant connected clusters. These clusters coincide with the region exhibiting the greatest instantaneous reduction in inter-particle forces, indicating a significant correlation between inter-particle force fluctuations and particle rearrangements. Furthermore, the magnitude of the greatest non-affine motion within these clusters correlates strongly with the magnitude of macroscopic stress fluctuations during slip events. This correlation increased when the non-affine motion of particles in a neighborhood around the point of greatest non-affine motion was included in the analysis, suggesting that plastic events are best understood as regional rather than point-like occurrences. Our results held for various inter-particle friction coefficients. Our findings suggest that elastoplastic models should consider plastic events as regional rather than point-like and highlight the importance of studying the propagation of particle rearrangements.</p>

            <p>Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of chiral symmetry preserving quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy sublattice-polarized modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</p>

            <h2>Connected Network Model for the Mechanical Loss of Amorphous Materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steven Blaber, Daniel Bruns, Jörg Rottler</p>
            <p>Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling, we explore the energy landscape of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, and find that the pairs of energy minima that constitute single TLS form a sparsely connected network with complex topologies. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many new avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.</p>

            <p>The idea to extract information on magnetically different phases from magnetic measurements is very attractive and many efforts have been made in this area. One of the most popular direction is to use the Preisach model formalism to analyze the 2D Preisach distribution function (PDF) obtained either from first order reversal curves (FORC) or minor loops. Here we present an alternative a much simpler procedure -- the analysis of the derivative of the saturation magnetization loop, the differential susceptibility curve. It follows the Lorentzian shape with very high accuracy for ferromagnetic polycrystalline materials. This allows decomposing any differential susceptibility curve of a complex multi-phase material into individual components representing different magnetic phases by Lorenzian peaks -- in the same way as it is done in X-ray diffraction analysis of materials. We show that the minor differential susceptibility curves also have the Lorenzian shape that can facilitate calculation of the Preisach distribution function from the experimental curves and reduce noise in the resulting PDF.</p>

            <p>Identification of crystallographic slip in metals and alloys is crucial to understand and improve their mechanical behavior. Recently, a novel slip system identification framework, termed SSLIP (for Slip Systems based Local Identification of Plasticity), was introduced to leap from conventional trace-based identification to automated, point-by-point identification, exploiting the full deformation kinematics. Using sub-micron-scale Digital Image Correlation (DIC) deformation fields aligned to Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) data, SSLIP matches the measured in-plane displacement gradient tensor to the kinematics of the optimal combination of multiple slip system activities, at each DIC datapoint. SSLIP was demonstrated to be successful on virtual and experimental case studies of FCC and BCC metals. However, for more challenging HCP crystal structures, the complete identification of all slip systems was found to be more challenging, posing limitations on automation and flexibility. To extend the capabilities of SSLIP, we propose an extended framework, hereinafter referred to as the +SSLIP method, which includes (i) a preselection of slip systems using a Radon transform, (ii) robustness to measured rigid body rotation by simultaneous identification of the local rotation field, (iii) identification of the two best matching slip systems for each data point, and (iv) a procedure to determine groups of slip systems with in-plane displacement gradient tensors that cannot be discriminated. This procedure yields the full (HCP) slip system activity maps for every slip system in each grain. The resulting objective identification method does not rely on the Schmid factor to select which slip system is active at each point. We show how slip systems from multiple slip families are successfully identified on virtual and real experiments on a Zn polycrystalline coating.</p>

            <h2>Multiscale Excitations in the Diluted Two-dimensional S = 1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Liuyun Dao, Hui Shao, Anders W. Sandvik</p>
            <p>We study the excitation spectrum of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the randomly diluted square lattice by analytic continuation of QMC data. At dilution fractions $p=1/16$ and $p=1/8$, the dynamic structure factor $S({\bf q},\omega)$ exhibits a damped magnon peak with anomalous dispersion near ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$, a non-dispersive low-energy localization peak, and a second peak between these two features. A magnon with anomalous dispersion, close to our result, was predicted in spin wave and $T$-matrix theory [A. Chernyshev et al., PRB {\bf 65}, 104407 (2002)], above the localization energy. However, no intermediate mode was predicted. Analyzing spectral functions in real space for individual vacancy realizations by energy tomography, we find that these excitations are concentrated on a small subset of the spins adjacent to vacancies. We argue that the low-energy excitations are those of a sparse random network of effective moments at a fraction of the vacancies. There is a shift in magnon spectral weight distribution, from the spins away from vacancies at high energy to those adjacent to vacancies at lower energy. We also analyze the Anderson quantum rotor excitation at $\omega \propto N^{-1}$ (with $N=L^2$ the system size), which in the clean system is visible in $S({\bf q},\omega)$ only at ${\bf q}=(\pi,\pi)$ but spreads through the Brillouin zone when $p>0$. Weight close to ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$ is explained by local sublattice imbalance within a dimer-monomer model but there is also structure arising from correlated singlet fluctuations, which we demonstrate by enhancing said fluctuations with four-spin couplings. All spectral features found here should be observable by elastic neutron scattering experiments on layered quantum antiferromagnets doped with nonmagnetic impurities.</p>

            <p>Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a ''new knob'' to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.</p>

            <p>While the physics of disordered packing in non-growing systems is well understood, unexplored phenomena can emerge when packing takes place in growing domains. We study the arrangements of pigment cells (chromatophores) on squid skin as a biological example of a packed system on an expanding surface. We find that relative density fluctuations in cell numbers grow with spatial scale. We term this behavior ``hyperdisordered'', in contrast with hyperuniform behavior in which relative fluctuations tend to zero at large scale. We find that hyperdisordered scaling, akin to that of a critical system, is quantitatively reproduced by a model in which hard disks are randomly inserted in a homogeneously growing surface. In addition, we find that chromatophores increase in size during animal development, but maintain a stationary size distribution. The physical mechanisms described in our work may apply to a broad class of growing dense systems.</p>

We theoretically demonstrate that the nonlinear Hall effect is intrinsically coupled to the underlying spin configuration. In particular, it exhibits a pronounced layer dependence in layered antiferromagnets, enabling direct characterization of the nature and strength of interlayer magnetic coupling in multilayer AFM insulators. Furthermore, we show that a a slight external field perturbation can induce and manipulate the magnon nonlinear Hall response.

            <p>We investigate the multipartite mutual information between $N$ discrete-state stochastic units interacting in a network that is invariant under unit permutations. We show that when the system relaxes to fixed point attractors, multipartite correlations in the stationary state either do not scale extensively with $N$, or the extensive scaling is not robust to arbitrarily small perturbations of the system dynamics. In particular, robust extensive scaling cannot occur in thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, mutual information scales extensively when the system relaxes to time-dependent attractors (e.g., limit cycles), which can occur only far from equilibrium. This demonstrates the essential role of dissipation in the generation and maintenance of multipartite correlations. We illustrate our theory with the nonequilibrium Potts model.</p>

            <h2>Universal Linear Response of the Mean First-Passage Time</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tommer D. Keidar, Shlomi Reuveni</p>
            <p>First-passage processes are pervasive across numerous scientific fields, yet a general framework for understanding their response to external perturbations remains elusive. While the fluctuation-dissipation theorem offers a complete linear response theory for systems in steady-state, it fails to apply to transient first-passage processes. We address this challenge by focusing on rare, rather than weak, perturbations. Surprisingly, we discover that the linear response of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to such perturbations is universal. It depends solely on the first two moments of the unperturbed first-passage time and the mean completion time following perturbation activation, without any assumptions about the underlying system's dynamics. To demonstrate the utility of our findings, we analyze the MFPT response of drift-diffusion processes in two scenarios: (i) stochastic resetting with information feedback, and (ii) an abrupt transition from a linear to a logarithmic potential. In both cases, our approach bypasses the need for explicit determination of the perturbed dynamics, unraveling a highly non-trivial response landscape with minimal effort. Finally, we show how our framework enables a new type of experiment-inferring molecular-level fluctuations from bulk measurements, a feat previously believed to be impossible. Overall, the newly discovered universality reported herein offers a powerful tool for predicting the impact of perturbations on kinetic processes, and for inferring underlying fluctuations from response measurements.</p>

Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.</p>

            <p>Symmetry breaking in a layered superconductor with Ising spin-orbit coupling has offered an opportunity to realize unconventional superconductivity. To be more specific, orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, exhibiting layer-dependent finite-momentum pairing, may emerge in transition metal dichalcogenides materials (TMDC) in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Orbital FFLO state can be more robust against the magnetic field than the conventional superconducting state with zero-momentum pairing. This feature renders its potential in field-resilient superconducting functionality. Although, orbital FFLO state has been reported in NbSe2 and MoS2, it is not yet clear if orbital FFLO state can be extended to other TMDC superconductor. Here, we report the observation of orbital FFLO state in 2H-NbS2 flakes and its dependence on the thickness of flake. We conclude that the relatively weak interlayer coupling is instrumental in stabilizing orbital FFLO state at higher temperature with respect to the critical temperature and lower magnetic field with respect to paramagnetic limit in NbS2 in comparison to its NbSe2 counterpart.</p>

Using the probability generating function for the actual physical process, we deduce the super-Poisson deviation of the covariance matrix of counts at the detector due to neutron multiplication upon fission. This leads to a general form that coincides with the second moment of an Ito process. This comparison facilitates the formulation of a corresponding effective Langevin equation, which potentially enables simulations that significantly reduce the computational resources required compared to direct simulation of the system's actual noise. This method could assist in designing sub-critical noise experiments for licensing new research reactors, for improving cross-section libraries and for non-destructive assays of spent fuel.</p>

In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.</p>

However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem.

The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexej Perevertov</p>
            <p>In this work we propose a simple phenomenological model for magnetization curves of stressed samples. The effect of stress is introduced by scaling the arctangent function argument (magnetic field) proportionally to stress. The magnetization curve is modelled by one or two arctangent functions. Despite of its simplicity, the model gives a very good agreement with experimental curves, reproducing all stress-induced features usually observed on the magnetization curves including the common crossover point and constricted hysteresis loops. The popular effective field concept in this model is just a consequence of a simple scaling of the magnetic field. We show that the differential susceptibility is inversely proportional to the applied stress for all magnetization values. We propose to analyze the field and differential susceptibility as a function of magnetization in contrast to convenient M(H) loops.</p>

            <h2>Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets: Interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tim Kokkeler, Ilya Tokatly, F. Sebastian Bergeret</p>
            <p>We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</p>

            <h2>Collinear Altermagnets and their Landau Theories</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hana Schiff, Paul McClarty, Jeffrey G. Rau, Judit Romhanyi</p>
            <p>Altermagnets exhibit spontaneously spin-split electronic bands in the zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC) limit arising from the presence of collinear compensated magnetic order. The distinctive magneto-crystalline symmetries of altermagnets ensure that these spin splittings have a characteristic anisotropy in crystal momentum space. These systems have attracted a great deal of interest due to their potential for applications in spintronics. In this paper, we provide a general Landau theory that encompasses all three-dimensional altermagnets where the magnetic order does not enlarge the unit cell. We identify all crystal structures that admit altermagnetism and then reduce these to a relatively small set of distinct possible Landau theories governing such systems. In the zero SOC limit, we determine the possible local multipolar orders that are tied to the spin splitting of the band structure. We make precise the connection between altermagnetism as defined at zero SOC ("ideal" altermagnets) and the effects of weak SOC. In particular, we examine which response functions allowed by symmetry when SOC is present are guaranteed by the spin-orbit free theory, and spell out the distinctive properties of altermagnets in comparison with conventional collinear antiferromagnets. Finally, we show how these ideas can be applied by considering a number of altermagnetic candidate materials.</p>

            <h2>Elastic tensor-derived properties of composition-dependent disordered refractory binary alloys</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Surya T. Bijjala, Susan R. Atlas, Pankaj Kumar</p>
            <p>The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of a material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) based on density functional theory (DFT) provides a powerful mechanism for computing and probing the microscopic features of elastic tensor-related properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion elastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural refractory body-centered cubic (BCC) binary alloys of molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), tantalum (Ta), and tungsten (W). For the first time, we have mapped the heterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus and associated relaxation fields at each lattice site by computing the force response internal strain tensor ($\Lambda$) and displacement response internal strain tensors ($\Gamma$). Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy pressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition for all refractory binaries. The computed mechanical properties data for the refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W compositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.</p>

            <p>We study transport in spin chains employing the Thouless approach based on the level sensitivity to the boundary conditions, $R$. Although spin transport in the integrable easy-axis XXZ model is diffusive, corresponding $R$ is much closer to ballistic chains than to chaotic diffusive systems. In the case of the grand canonical ensemble, this observation can be rigorously justified, while in the case of the canonical ensemble it can be demonstrated by numerical calculations. Integrability breaking perturbation (IBP) strongly reduces $R$ which reveals a pronounced minimum at the crossover from anomalous diffusive to normal dissipative transport. This minimum coincides with the onset of the universality of the random matrix theory. Results for various IBP suggest a discontinuous jump of the spin conductivity in the thermodynamic limit, and moreover that its value is proportional to the strength of the IBP.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous topological edge modes in a periodically-driven trimer lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Ghuneim, Raditya Weda Bomantara</p>
            <p>Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation for establishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart. In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with three sites per unit cell, obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their $3\times 3$ counterparts. The system is found to support a number of edge modes over a range of parameter windows, some of which have no static counterparts. Among these edge modes, of particular interest are those which are pinned at a specific quasienergy value. Such quasienergy-fixed edge modes arise due to the interplay between topology and chiral symmetry, which are typically not expected in a three-band static model due to the presence of a bulk band at the only chiral-symmetric energy value, i.e., zero. In our time-periodic setting, another chiral-symmetric quasienergy value exists at half the driving frequency, which is not occupied by a bulk band and could then host chiral-symmetry-protected edge modes ($\pi$ modes). Finally, we verify the robustness of all edge modes against spatial disorder and briefly discuss the prospect of realizing our system in experiments.</p>

            <p>We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works universally for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</p>

            <p>In this work, we study an interacting tight-binding model of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), with a twist angle of $1.05^\circ$. We derive effective theories based on a mean-field normal state at charge neutrality, thereby including the renormalizations coming from integrating out high-energy modes. In these theories, the flat bands display a sizable increase of the bandwidth, suggesting the renormalization of the magic angle. Additionally, the corresponding wavefunctions flow towards the limit of perfect particle-hole symmetry and sublattice polarization (the 'chiral' limit). We further represent the flat bands in the 'vortex Chern' basis and discuss the implications on the dynamics, regarding the 'flat' and 'chiral' symmetries of MATBG, as manifested in the symmetry-broken states at neutrality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuchen Meng, Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Zefan Tan, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou</p>
            <p>The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$-plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$-plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</p>

            <h2>Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Tausendpfund, Aditi Mitra, Matteo Rizzi</p>
            <p>Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andressa R. Medeiros-Silva, Mariana Malard, Rodrigo G. Pereira, Thereza Paiva</p>
            <p>Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines and those enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayana Ezoe, Makoto Katori, Tomoyuki Shirai</p>
            <p>Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-masses for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of data analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</p>

            <p>The emerging field of valleytronics harnesses the valley degree of freedom of electrons, akin to how electronic and spintronic devices utilize the charge and spin degrees of freedom of electrons respectively. The engineering of valleytronic devices typically relies on the coupling between valley and other degrees of freedom such as spin, giving rise to valley-spintronics where an external magnetic field manipulates the information stored in valleys. Here, the valley gapless semiconductor is proposed as a potential electrically controlled valleytronic platform because the valley degree of freedom is coupled to the carrier type, i.e., electrons and holes. The valley degree of freedom can be electrically controlled by tuning the carrier type via the device gate voltage. We demonstrate the proposal for realizing a valley gapless semiconductor in the honeycomb lattice with the Haldane and modified Haldane models. The system's valley-carrier coupling is further studied for its transport properties in an all-electrically controlled valley filter device setting. Our work highlights the significance of the valley gapless semiconductor for valleytronic devices.</p>

            <p>Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.</p>

A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations.

            <p>Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a ``maximally mixed'' classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.</p>

            <p>We study the memorization and generalization capabilities of Diffusion Models (DMs) when data lies on a structured latent manifold. Specifically, we consider a set of $P$ data points in $N$ dimensions confined to a latent subspace of dimension $D = \alpha_D N$, following the Hidden Manifold Model (HMM). We analyze the reverse diffusion process using the empirical score function as a proxy, and characterize it in the high-dimensional limit $P = \exp(\alpha N)$, $N \gg 1$, by exploiting a connection with the Random Energy Model (REM). We show that a characteristic time $t_o$ marks the emergence of traps in the time-dependent potential, which however do not affect typical trajectories. The size of their basins of attraction is computed at all times. We derive the collapse time $t_c < t_o$, at which trajectories fall into the basin of a training point, signaling memorization. An explicit formula for $t_c$ as a function of $P$ and $\alpha_D$ shows that the curse of dimensionality is avoided for structured data ($\alpha_D \ll 1$), even with nonlinear manifolds. We also prove that collapse corresponds to the condensation transition in the REM. Generalization is quantified via the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact distribution and the reverse one at time $t$. We find a distinct time $t_g < t_c < t_o$ minimizing this divergence. Surprisingly, the best generalization occurs inside the memorization phase. We conclude that generalization in DMs improves with data structure, as $t_g \to 0$ faster than $t_c$ when $\alpha_D \to 0$.</p>

            <p>We study the quantum quench of a finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder on it. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law decay with decreasing quench rate, and the power is consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By contrast, the Kibble-Zurek scaling of excitation density is absent in the Kane-Mele model once disorder is switched on, which we attribute to the emergence of a disorder-induced gapless region. In particular, the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of excitation density, namely, larger excitation density at slower quench, is observed at suitable model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution. The difference of onsite occupation between the time-evolved state and instantaneous ground state at the end of the quench can successfully capture the key features of excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models under periodic and more realistic open boundary conditions, thus facilitating the experimental characterization of the quench dynamics in these models.</p>

            <p>In quantum nanoelectronics devices, the electrostatic energy is the largest energy scale at play and, to a large extend, it determines the charge distribution inside the devices. Here, we introduce the Pure Electrostatic Self consistent Approximation (PESCA) that provides a minimum model that describes how to include a semiconductor in an electrostatic calculation to properly account for both screening and partial depletion due to e.g. field effect. We show how PESCA may be used to reconstruct the charge distribution from the measurement of pinch-off phase diagrams in the gate voltages space. PESCA can also be extended to account for magnetic field and calculate the edge reconstruction in the quantum Hall regime. The validity of PESCA is controlled by a small parameter $\kappa = C_g/C_q$, the ratio of the geometrical capacitance to the quantum capacitance, which is, in many common situations, of the order of 1%, making PESCA a quantitative technique for the calculation of the charge distribution inside devices.</p>

            <p>We consider random instances of non-convex perceptron problems in the high-dimensional limit of a large number of examples $M$ and weights $N$, with finite load $\alpha = M/N$. We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $\kappa$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $\alpha-\kappa$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.</p>

The SkX phase is stabilized at finite fields and at finite temperatures for both F and AF $J_{1c}$, although it is destabilized by modestly weak AF $J_{1c}$. The magnetic phase diagram of the 3D short-range model is more or less similar to those of the 2D short-range model and of the 2D long-range RKKY model. We find that an intriguing phenomenon of replica-symmetry breaking, popular in glass physics and recently identified in the SkX phase of the 3D long-range RKKY model [K. Mitsumoto and H.

Using a combination of variational and Monte Carlo techniques, built around the exact treatment of spin-1 at the level of a single site, we uncover seven distinct spin liquid phases. Dynamical calculations for one of these spin liquids are shown to be in good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering on the spin-1 pyrochlore $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$.

B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</p>

            <h2>Lanczos-Pascal approach to correlation functions in chaotic quantum systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Merlin Füllgraf, Jiaozi Wang, Robin Steinigeweg, Jochen Gemmer</p>
            <p>We suggest a method to compute approximations to temporal correlation functions of few-body observables in chaotic many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit based on the respective Lanczos coefficients. Given the knowledge of these Lanczos coefficients, the method is very cheap. Usually accuracy increases with more Lanczos coefficients taken into account, however, we numerically find and analytically argue that the convergence is rather quick, if the Lanczos coefficients exhibit a smoothly increasing structure. For pertinent examples we compare with data from dynamical typicality computations for large but finite systems and find good agreement if few Lanczos coefficients are taken into account. From the method it is evident that in these cases the correlation functions are well described by a low number of damped oscillations.</p>

            <h2>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ryuichi Shindou, Pengwei Zhao</p>
            <p>U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</p>

            <h2>Visualization of spin-splitter effect in altermagnets via non-equilibrium Green functions on a lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karl Bergson Hallberg, Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder</p>
            <p>When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.</p>

            <h2>Excitability and travelling waves in renewable active matter</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Abhishek, Ankit Dhanuka, Deb Sankar Banerjee, Madan Rao</p>
            <p>Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.</p>

            <p>In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</p>

            <p>We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets (AMs) constitute a novel class of spin-compensated materials in which opposite-spin sublattices are connected by a crystal rotation, causing their electronic iso-energy surfaces to be spin-split. While cubic and tetragonal crystal symmetries tend to produce AMs in which the splitting of electronic iso-energy surfaces has $d$-wave symmetry, hexagonal AMs, such as CrSb and MnTe, are $g$-wave AMs. Here we investigate the purely magnetic modes and spin-textures of $g$-wave AMs and show that they are drastically different for easy-axial (CrSb) and easy-planar (MnTe) materials. We show that in CrSb the splitting of the chiral magnon branches possesses $g$-wave symmetry, with each branch carrying a fixed momentum-independent magnetic moment. The altermagnetic splitting is not affected by the easy-axial anisotropy and is the same as that in the nonrelativistic limit. The magnon splitting of MnTe, however, does not strictly possess $g$-wave symmetry due to its easy-planar anisotropy. Instead, the magnetic moment of each branch becomes momentum-dependent, with a distribution that is of $g$-wave symmetry. To generalize the concept of the altermagnetic splitting beyond the nonrelativistic limit, we introduce alternative, directly observable splitting parameter which comprises both the magnon eigenenergy and its magnetic moment and possesses the $g$-wave symmetry in both easy-axial and easy-planar cases. The associated altermagnetic domain walls in easy-axial CrSb possess a net magnetization with an amplitude that depends on their orientation.</p>

            <p>We propose the perspective of symmetry-selective resonance of the $\Delta_1$ states in the Fe/MgO/ZnO/MgO/Fe heterostructures, offering a broad landscape to design magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) that yield a towering tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) up to $3.5\times10^4\%$ with the resistance area (RA) product dipping down to a minimum of $0.05~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$, while maintaining a nearly perfect (99\%) spin polarization. Our predictions are based on the self-consistent coupling of the non-equilibrium Green's function with density functional theory. We also present the charge current, spin current, and TMR with applied voltage of the Fe/MgO(3-layer)/ZnO(3-layer)/MgO(3-layer)/Fe MTJ, which offers a superior performance triad of TMR ($1.3\times10^4\%$), RA ($0.45~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$), and spin polarization (99\%) over a regular Fe/MgO(6-layer)/Fe based MTJ (TMR $\approx 3.4\times10^3\%$, RA $\approx 22~\Omega\cdot\mu \text{m}^2$).

            <p>Exact diagonalization (ED) is a cornerstone technique in quantum many-body physics, enabling precise solutions to the Schrödinger equation for interacting quantum systems. Despite its utility in studying ground states, excited states, and dynamical behaviors, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size presents significant computational challenges. We introduce XDiag, an open-source software package designed to combine advanced and efficient algorithms for ED with and without symmetry-adapted bases with user-friendly interfaces. Implemented in C++ for computational efficiency and wrapped in Julia for ease of use, XDiag provides a comprehensive toolkit for ED calculations. Key features of XDiag include the first publicly accessible implementation of sublattice coding algorithms for large-scale spin system diagonalizations, efficient Lin table algorithms for symmetry lookups, and random-hashing techniques for distributed memory parallelization. The library supports various Hilbert space types (e.g., spin-1/2, electron, and t-J models), facilitates symmetry-adapted block calculations, and automates symmetry considerations. The package is complemented by extensive documentation, a user guide, reproducible benchmarks demonstrating near-linear scaling on thousands of CPU cores, and over 20 examples covering ground-state calculations, spectral functions, time evolution, and thermal states. By integrating high-performance computing with accessible scripting capabilities, XDiag allows researchers to perform state-of-the-art ED simulations and explore quantum many-body phenomena with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.</p>

            <p>Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydride apart from H$_2$S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.</p>

            <p>The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has recently improved beyond 20%. The active layers of these devices comprise of at least two organic semiconductors, forming a type II heterojunction. Hereby, the device performance is determined by the kinetic interplay of various species, including localized excitons, charge transfer states as well as charge-separated states. However, a model which describes all relevant photovoltaic measures has yet to be developed. Herein, we present a comprehensive 5-state rate model which includes both singlet and triplet charge transfer states and takes into account the formation, re-splitting and decay of the local triplet state, parametric in the respective energy offset. We show that this model not only describes key device properties such as charge generation efficiency, photoluminescence, electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor simultaneously but also elucidate how these vary across material combinations based on the D:A interfacial energy offset alone. We find that the electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor depend strongly on the triplet properties and that the triplet decay becomes the dominant charge recombination pathway for systems with moderate offset, in full agreement to previous experimental results. Validation against literature data demonstrates the model's ability to predict the device efficiency accurately. Subsequently, we identify material combinations with singlet exciton to charge transfer state energetic offset of roughly 150meV as particularly promising. Our model explains further why recent certified efficiency records for binary blends remain at ca. 20% if no further means to improve photon and charge carrier harvesting are taken.</p>

            <h2>Sliding Friction of Hard Sliders on Rubber: Theory and Experiment</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Xu, B.N.J. Persson</p>
            <p>We present a study of sliding friction for rigid triangular steel sliders on soft rubber substrates under both lubricated and dry conditions. For rubber surfaces lubricated with a thin film of silicone oil, the measured sliding friction at room temperature agrees well with theoretical predictions obtained from a viscoelastic model originally developed for rolling friction. On the lubricated surface, the sliding friction is primarily due to bulk viscoelastic energy dissipation in the rubber. The model, which includes strain-dependent softening of the rubber modulus, accurately predicts the experimental friction curves. At lower temperatures ($T = -20^\circ {\rm C}$ and $-40^\circ {\rm C}$), the measured friction exceeds the theoretical prediction. We attribute this increase to penetration of the lubricant film by surface asperities, leading to a larger adhesive contribution. For dry surfaces, the adhesive contribution becomes dominant. By subtracting the viscoelastic component inferred from the lubricated case, we estimate the interfacial frictional shear stress. This shear stress increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the sliding speed, consistent with stress-augmented thermal activation mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Majorana vortex phases in time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators and topologically trivial insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xun-Jiang Luo</p>
            <p>Majorana vortex phases have been extensively studied in topological materials with conventional superconducting pairing. Inspired by recent experimental progress in realizing time-reversal invariant higher-order topological insulators (THOTIs) and inducing superconducting proximity effects, we investigate Majorana vortex phases in these systems. We construct THOTIs as two copies of a topological insulator (TI) with time-reversal symmetry-preserving mass terms that anisotropically gap the surface states. We find that these mass terms have a negligible impact on the vortex phase transitions of double TIs when treated as perturbations, and no additional topological phase transitions are induced. Consequently, $\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) emerge when the chemical potential lies between the critical chemical potentials $\mu_c^{(1)}$ and $\mu_c^{(2)}$ of the two TI vortex phase transitions. We demonstrate this behavior across multiple THOTI models, including rotational symmetry-protected THOTI, inversion symmetry-protected THOTI, rotational and inversion symmetries-protected THOTI bismuth, and extrinsic THOTI. Remarkably, MVEMs persist even when all surfaces are gapped with the same sign, rendering the system topologically trivial in both first- and second-order classifications. Our findings establish that MVEMs can be realized in time-reversal invariant systems with fully gapped surfaces, encompassing both topologically nontrivial and trivial insulators, thus significantly broadening the solid state material platforms for hosting Majorana vortex phases.</p>

            <p>We study the landscapes of multi-species spherical spin glasses. Our results determine the phase boundary for annealed trivialization of the number of critical points, and establish its equivalence with a quenched strong topological trivialization property. Namely in the "trivial" regime, the number of critical points is constant, all are well-conditioned, and all approximate critical points are close to a true critical point. As a consequence, we deduce that Langevin dynamics at sufficiently low temperature has logarithmic mixing time. Our approach begins with the Kac--Rice formula. We characterize the annealed trivialization phase by explicitly solving a suitable multi-dimensional variational problem, obtained by simplifying certain asymptotic determinant formulas from (Ben Arous--Bourgade--McKenna 2023, McKenna 2024). To obtain more precise quenched results, we develop general purpose techniques to avoid sub-exponential correction factors and show non-existence of approximate critical points. Many of the results are new even in the 1-species case.</p>

            <h2>The Fate of Entanglement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gilles Parez, William Witczak-Krempa</p>
            <p>Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mason N. Rouches, Benjamin B. Machta</p>
            <p>The three-dimensional organization of chromatin is thought to play an important role in controlling gene expression. Specificity in expression is achieved through the interaction of transcription factors and other nuclear proteins with particular sequences of DNA. At unphysiological concentrations many of these nuclear proteins can phase-separate in the absence of DNA, and it has been hypothesized that, in vivo, the thermodynamic forces driving these phases help determine chromosomal organization. However it is unclear how DNA, itself a long polymer subject to configurational transitions, interacts with three-dimensional protein phases. Here we show that a long compressible polymer can be coupled to interacting protein mixtures, leading to a generalized prewetting transition where polymer collapse is coincident with a locally stabilized liquid droplet. We use lattice Monte-Carlo simulations and a mean-field theory to show that these phases can be stable even in regimes where both polymer collapse and coexisting liquid phases are unstable in isolation, and that these new transitions can be either abrupt or continuous. For polymers with internal linear structure we further show that changes in the concentration of bulk components can lead to changes in three-dimensional polymer structure. In the nucleus there are many distinct proteins that interact with many different regions of chromatin, potentially giving rise to many different Prewet phases. The simple systems we consider here highlight chromatin's role as a lower-dimensional surface whose interactions with proteins are required for these novel phases.</p>

            <p>In the last two decades, fluctuation theorems have been proved formally and demonstrated experimentally for several variables (such as entropy production, work, or flux) and different noises causing the fluctuations (of either thermal or other origin; Markovian or non-Markovian). Here we report the observation of a detailed fluctuation relation in a statistical process outside thermodynamics and physics: the card game UNO. As the fluctuating variable, we consider the number of steps $W$ needed for one player's deck to change from $x$ to $y$ number of cards. The other players and the remaining cards play the role of a finite non-Markovian bath. Numerical simulations of runs of the game show that $W$ obeys a fluctuation relation analogous to Crooks' theorem. While the observed behavior shares some common features with infinite random walks, it also exhibits deviations that are clear signatures of non-Markovianity and the finiteness of the bath: Notably, the parameter corresponding to temperature depends strongly on the transition $x\rightarrow y$. Our paper contributes to extending the scope of fluctuation theorems beyond their usual thermodynamic setting.</p>

            <p>A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</p>

In these systems, the time evolution can be represented by trajectories on a three-dimensional manifold. Given the initial and final states, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to a geodesic on the manifold. When the trajectory between the initial and final states is specified, the minimum-cost control corresponds to a geodesic within a submanifold embedded in the three-dimensional space. This framework provides a geometric method for optimizing shortcuts to adiabatic driving.</p>

            <h2>Non-Markovian Rock-Paper-Scissors games</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ohad Vilk, Mauro Mobilia, Michael Assaf</p>
            <p>There is mounting evidence that species interactions often involve long-term memory, with highly-varying waiting times between successive events and long-range temporal correlations. Accounting for memory undermines the common Markovian assumption, and dramatically impacts key ingredients of population dynamics including birth, foraging, predation, and competition processes. Here, we study a critical aspect of population dynamics, namely non-Markovian multi-species competition. This is done in the realm of the zero-sum rock-paper-scissors (zRPS) model that is broadly used in the life sciences to metaphorically describe cyclic competition between three interacting species. We develop a general non-Markovian formalism for multi-species dynamics, allowing us to determine the regions of the parameter space where each species dominates. In particular, when the dynamics are Markovian, the waiting times are exponentially distributed and the fate of the zRPS model in large well-mixed populations is encoded in a remarkably simple condition, often referred to as the ``law of the weakest'' (LOW), stating that the species with the lowest growth rate is the most likely to prevail. We show that the survival behavior and LOW of the zRPS model are critically affected by non-exponential waiting times, and especially, by their coefficient of variation. Our findings provide key insight into the influence of long waiting times on non-Markovian evolutionary processes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Romain Pierrat, Julia Rocha, Rémi Carminati</p>
            <p>We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend the analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We introduce an effective medium description providing a simple analysis of the propagation regimes. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raul Ortega-Ochoa, Tejs Vegge, Jes Frellsen</p>
            <p>We introduce MolMiner, a fragment-based, geometry-aware, and order-agnostic autoregressive model for molecular design. MolMiner supports conditional generation of molecules over twelve properties, enabling flexible control across physicochemical and structural targets. Molecules are built via symmetry-aware fragment attachments, with 3D geometry dynamically updated during generation using forcefields. A probabilistic conditioning mechanism allows users to specify any subset of target properties while sampling the rest. MolMiner achieves calibrated conditional generation across most properties and offers competitive unconditional performance. We also propose improved benchmarking methods for both unconditional and conditional generation, including distributional comparisons via Wasserstein distance and calibration plots for property control. To our knowledge, this is the first model to unify dynamic geometry, symmetry handling, order-agnostic fragment-based generation, and high-dimensional multi-property conditioning.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Noriyuki Sogabe, Yi Yin</p>
            <p>We explore the interplay between Berry curvature and topological properties in single-flavor color superconductors, where quarks form spin-one Cooper pairs. By deriving a new relation, we connect the topological nodal structure of the gap function in momentum space to the (nonabelian) Berry flux associated with paired quarks. This generalizes the early work by Li and Haldane [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 067003 (2018)] to systems with additional internal quantum numbers, such as color. In the ultrarelativistic limit, we uncover rich topological structures driven by the interplay of spin, chirality, and color. Specifically, we identify chirality-induced topological nodes in the transverse (opposite chirality pairing) polar and A phases. In contrast, the color-spin-locking phase lacks these nodes due to a nontrivial color Berry flux, which in turn induces gapless excitations with total Berry monopole charges of $\pm 3/2-$differing from conventional Weyl fermions. Our findings can be potentially extended to other fermionic systems carrying additional internal degrees of freedom.</p>

            <p>Used extensively in sensing applications, the application of solution-state electrochemiluminescent devices (ECLDs) in lighting and displays has been constrained by their low luminance and short operational lifetime. Here, we report a record improvement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) and demonstrate its use in a calligraphic display. We use the double-decker arrangement assumed by the electron donor and acceptor segments of the molecule TpAT-tFFO to realize thermally activated delayed fluorescence from an electrogenerated charge-transfer (CT) excimer state and a subsequent energy transfer to the rubrene emitter TBRb. ECLDs based on this strategy achieve an unprecedented luminance of >6,200 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime is more than 10-fold longer than all previous ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between excimer and emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF; spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with energy gaps < 0.4 eV operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. Our findings highlight the potential of ECiHF for improving ECLDs and pave the way to commercial applications of this form of fluid light.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andras Suto</p>
            <p>A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</p>

            <p>Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_\kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_\kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</p>

            <p>Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.</p>

            <p>Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states are distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate a $C$-type Lie algebra, with rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.</p>

            <h2>Super diffusive length dependent thermal conductivity in one-dimensional materials with structural defects: longitudinal to transverse phonon scattering leads to $κ\propto L^{1/3}$ law</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander L. Burin</p>
            <p>Structural defects in one-dimensional heat conductors couple longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending) vibrations. This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as $\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ($\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal conductivity depending on the size as $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, though the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also be significant.</p>

While the equipartition of entanglement holds at leading order, we identify subleading corrections that break it.

            <p>Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</p>

            <p>We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states -- a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, in which hotter liquids freeze faster than colder ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian spectrum plays a critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.</p>

            <p>Information processing abilities of active matter are studied in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elia Moretti, Michel Loreau, Michael Benzaquen</p>
            <p>The intensification of European agriculture, characterized by increasing farm sizes, landscape simplification and reliance on synthetic pesticides, remains a key driver of biodiversity decline. While many studies have investigated this phenomenon, they often focus on isolated elements, resulting in a lack of holistic understanding and leaving policymakers and farmers with unclear priorities. This study addresses this gap by developing a spatially explicit ecological economic model designed to dissect the complex interplay between landscape structure and pesticide application, and their combined effects on natural enemy populations and farmers' economic returns. In particular, the model investigates how these relationships are modulated by farm size (a crucial aspect frequently overlooked in prior research). By calibrating on the European agricultural sector, we explore the ecological and economic consequences of various policy scenarios. We show that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies is strongly contingent upon farm size. Small to medium-sized farms can experience economic benefits from reduced pesticide use when coupled with hedgerow restoration, owing to enhanced natural pest control. In contrast, large farms encounter challenges in achieving comparable economic gains due to inherent landscape characteristics. This highlights the need to account for farm size in agri-environmental policies in order to promote biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability.</p>

            <p>Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</p>

            <p>Magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene stands out as a highly tunable class of moiré materials that exhibit strong electronic correlations and robust superconductivity. However, understanding the relations between the low-temperature superconducting phase and the preceding correlated phases established at higher temperatures remains a challenge. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to track the formation sequence of correlated phases established by the interplay of dynamic correlations, intervalley coherence, and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). We discover the existence of two well-resolved gaps pinned at the Fermi level within the superconducting doping range. While the outer gap, previously associated with pseudogap phase, persists at high temperatures and magnetic fields, the newly revealed inner gap is more fragile in line with superconductivity MATTG transport experiments. Andreev reflection spectroscopy taken at the same location confirms a clear trend that closely follows the doping behaviour of the inner gap, and not the outer one. Moreover, spectroscopy taken at nanoscale domain boundaries further corroborates the contrasting behavior of the two gaps, with the inner gap remaining resilient to structural variations, as expected from the finite superconducting coherence length. By comparing our findings with recent topological heavy-fermion models, we identify that the outer gap originates from the splitting of the Abrikosov-Suhl-Kondo resonance due to the breaking of the valley symmetry arising from correlation-driven effects. Our results suggest an intricate but tractable hierarchy of correlated phases in twisted multilayer graphene.</p>

The molecular layer has a uniaxial structure with excitonic transitions whose transition dipole moments are well defined. The presence of the molecular layer results in an enormous increase in the response of the phototransistor. We further demonstrate that the signal-enhancement is due to p-photodoping of the graphene. The spectroscopic photoresponse suggests that the photodoping via monomers and molecular aggregates takes place differently. Our photodetector is a platform to study the influence of molecular aggregation and order on charge transport processes between aggregated organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials.</p>

            <p>Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state.

In spite of the novel hybrid magnonic functionalities that have been demonstrated, the effect of the Floquet drive has been relatively weak due to the limited driving efficiency, limiting its broader application. This work shows that by utilizing LC resonances, the Floquet drive in our cavity electromagnonic device can be drastically enhanced, giving rise to drastically boosted interaction between hybrid modes with fundamentally different spectral characteristics compared with previous demonstrations. In addition, the Floquet drives can also be obtained from GHz signals on such a system, allowing the demonstration of more advanced signal operations. Our novel resonance-enhanced Floquet cavity electromagnonics points to a new direction to fully unleash the potential of Floquet hybrid magnonics.</p>

            <h2>Multi-shot readout error benchmark of the nitrogen-vacancy center's electronic qubit</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Péter Boross, Domonkos Svastits, Győző Egri, András Pályi</p>
            <p>The ground-state electronic spin of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond can be used for room-temperature experiments showing coherent qubit functionality. At room temperature, photoluminescence-based qubit readout has a low single-shot fidelity; however, the populations of the qubit's two basis states can be inferred using multi-shot readout. In this work, we calculate the dependence of the error of a multi-shot inference method on various parameters of the readout process. This multi-shot readout error scales as $\Delta/\sqrt{N}$, with $N$ being the number of shots, suggesting to use the coefficient $\Delta$ as a simple multi-shot readout error benchmark. Our calculation takes into account background photons, photon loss, and initialization error. Our model enables the identification of the readout error budget, i.e., the role various imperfections play in setting the readout error. Our results enable experimentalists and engineers to focus their efforts on those hardware improvements that yield the highest performance gain for multi-shot readout.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in moire engineering provide new pathways for manipulating lattice distortions and electronic properties in low-dimensional materials. Here, we demonstrate that twisted stacking can induce dipolar vortices in metallic SrRuO3 membranes, despite the presence of free charges that would normally screen depolarizing fields and dipole-dipole interactions. These polarization vortices are correlated with moire-periodic flexoelectricity induced by shear strain gradients, and exhibit a pronounced dependence on the twist angle. In addition, multiferroic behavior emerges below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of the films, whereby polarization and ferromagnetism coexist and compete, showing opposite twist-angle dependencies of their respective magnitudes. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the microscopic origin of these observations. Our findings extend the scope of polarization topology design beyond dielectric materials and into metals.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic spin-polarized conductivity in collinear altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mingbo Dou, Xianjie Wang, L. L. Tao</p>
            <p>The altermagnet exhibits the nonrelativistic spin splitting that enables all-electrical generation of spin-polarized currents beyond the spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on a study on the anisotropic spin-polarized conductivity in collinear altermagnets. Based on the Boltzmann transport theory, we first study this effect using the general group-theoretical analysis and identify the spin point groups sustaining the finite spin polarization defined in terms of spin-polarized conductivity. We show that the spin polarization vanishes along any direction for the $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets while the spin polarization is significantly anisotropic for the $d$-wave altermagnet. We further derive the analytical expressions for the anisotropic spin polarization in the $d$-wave altermagnets. Then, we exemplify those phenomena in several representative altermagnets based on the density functional theory calculations. Our work enriches the altermagnetic spintronics and paves the practical way to produce large spin polarization in collinear altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Phonon lasers, as their photon counterparts, rely on the physics of stimulated emission. Arguably, because light does not require a material substrate to propagate, while sound does, the impact of the two technologies has however been highly contrasting, with "sasers" (for sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) mostly remaining as an academic curiosity. This might be changing due to the possibility to use coherent sound generation for on-chip processing of information at ultra-high frequencies, and in the quantum realm, in integrated photonic and optomechanical devices. Inspired by the concept of unipolar lasers based on the quantum engineering of states in semiconductor heterostructures, we propose and implement a quantum cascade phonon laser (QCPL). A condensate of exciton-photon quasiparticles (polaritons) is optically induced in a microstructured semiconductor device to jump down a ladder of engineered levels. This down-cascade is accompanied by the efficient stimulated emission of phonons of $\sim 20$, $\sim 60$, and $\sim 100$~GHz, which are designed to strongly interact with the polaritons on the same chip. The proposed concept opens the path for the design of integrated high-frequency optomechanical devices, as for example for non-reciprocal photon transport and multi-wavelength Brillouin lasers.</p>

            <p>Perovskite microwires are promising candidates for integrated photonic systems due to their strong nonlinear optical response and inherent waveguiding capabilities. In this study, we focus on the directional emission properties of exciton-polariton condensates formed within perovskite microwires, with emphasis on emission collected from the microwire end. We constructed a multi-angle optical detection setup that allows us to identify the exciton-polariton condensation threshold and track the evolution of the condensate for different excitation position along and across the microwire. We observe spectrally narrow exciton-polariton condensate emission from the microwire end even when the condensate is generated tens of micrometers away, which demonstrates the ability of the exciton-polariton condensate to propagate over long distances within the microwire. Furthermore, we find that the presence of structural defects near the condensate location can significantly enhance the emission from the microwire end due to aligning the condensate's momentum with the waveguide direction, thereby facilitating more efficient propagation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adrian Reich, Dmitriy S. Shapiro, Alexander Shnirman</p>
            <p>We investigate quantum phase transitions in a topological Josephson junction with an embedded ferromagnetic layer, revealing a rich landscape of critical phenomena. The low-energy excitations comprise Majorana fermions propagating along the junction, coupled to the magnons in the ferromagnet. Based on mean-field and renormalization group arguments, we predict Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions in this system, both in the case of a magnetic easy-plane and weak easy-axis anisotropy. In the latter case, this is based on an emergent effective easy-plane, spanned by the easy-axis and the component of the magnetization which couples to the Majoranas. We conclude by presenting a conjecture for the full phase diagram of the model. It covers BKT transitions as well as exotic multicritical and supersymmetric points known from related models of interacting real fermions and bosons.</p>

            <p>Electrons can form an ordered solid crystal phase ascribed to the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy. Tuning these energy scales can drive a phase transition from electron solid to liquid, i.e. melting of Wigner crystal. Generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) pinned to moire superlattices have been reported by optical and scanning-probe-based methods. Using transport measurements to investigate GWCs is vital to a complete characterization, however, still poses a significant challenge due to difficulties in making reliable electrical contacts. Here, we report the electrical transport detection of GWCs at fractional fillings nu = 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 8/9, 10/9, and 4/3 in twisted bilayer MoSe2. We further observe that these GWCs undergo continuous quantum melting transitions to liquid phases by tuning doping density, magnetic and displacement fields, manifested by quantum critical scaling behaviors. Our findings establish twisted bilayer MoSe2 as a novel system to study strongly correlated states of matter and their quantum phase transitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Won Sang Chung, L. M. Nieto, Soroush Zare, Hassan Hassanabadi</p>
            <p>In this work, we explore both the ordinary $q$-Gaussian distribution and a new one defined here, determining both their mean and variance, and we use them to construct solutions of the $q$-deformed diffusion differential equation. This approach allows us to realize that the standard deviation of the distribution must be a function of time. In one case, we derive a linear Fokker-Planck equation within a finite region, revealing a new form of both the position- and time-dependent diffusion coefficient and the corresponding continuity equation. It is noteworthy that, in both cases, the conventional result is obtained when $q$ tends to zero. Furthermore, we derive the deformed diffusion-decay equation in a finite region, also determining the position- and time-dependent decay coefficient. A discrete version of this diffusion-decay equation is addressed, in which the discrete times have a uniform interval, while for the discrete positions the interval is not uniform.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Charles Stahl, Oliver Hart, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Rahul Nandkishore</p>
            <p>We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omri Lesser, Sagnik Banerjee, Xuepeng Wang, Jaewon Kim, Ehud Altman, Debanjan Chowdhury</p>
            <p>It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ming Zhang, Cui-Qun Chen, Dao-Xin Yao, Fan Yang</p>
            <p>The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.</p>

            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is pushing the limits of digital computing to such an extent that, if current trends were to continue, global energy consumption from computation alone would eclipse all other forms of energy within the next two decades. One promising approach to reduce energy consumption and to increase computational speed is in-memory analog computing. However, analog computing necessitates a fundamental rethinking of computation at the material level, where information is stored as continuously variable physical observables. This shift introduces challenges related to the precision, dynamic range, and reliability of analog devices - issues that have hindered the development of existing memory technology for use in analog computers. Here, we address these issues in the context of memory which stores information as resistance. Our approach utilizes an electrochemical cell to tune the bulk oxygen-vacancy concentration within a metal oxide film. Through leveraging the gate contact as both a heater and source of electrochemical currents, kinetic barriers are overcome to enable a dynamic range of nine decades of analog tunable resistance, more than 3,000 available states, and programming with voltages less than 2 V. Furthermore, we demonstrate deterministic write operations with high precision, current-voltage linearity across six decades, and programming speeds as fast as 15 ns. These characteristics pave the way toward low-power analog computers with potential to improve AI efficiency by orders of magnitude.</p>

We observe a persistent photoinduced red shift of the CTG that lasts up to 1000 ps. The red shift during the slow decay after 10 ps can be well modeled by the localized picture, whereas its maximum value at ~0.9 ps involves additional contribution from the renormalization of the Hubbard U due to screening effect from delocalized electrons. Furthermore, coupling between the mid-gap absorption and a slow acoustic phonon launches coherent oscillations below the CTG, observed as a ~20 GHz modulation with a dispersion independent of the pump fluence. These results demonstrate the tunning of the CTG by light, unveil complex interplay between multiple degrees of freedom, and contribute to a deeper understanding of superconductivity and correlated materials.</p>

            <p>Nematicity and magnetism are prevalent orders in high transition temperature (Tc) superconductors, coexisting in the parent compound of most material families. Quantum fluctuations of nematicity or spin orders are both plausible candidates for mediating unconventional Cooper pairing. Identifying the sole effect of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP) on the emergence of superconducting dome without interference of spin fluctuations is therefore highly desirable. The iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe exhibits pure nematicity without any magnetic ordering. A nematic quantum phase transition can be induced by Te substitution but experimental study of such transition is so far limited to its normal state. By performing local susceptometry on composition-spread FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ films ($0 < x < 1$) using scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (sSQUID) microscopy, we investigate the superfluid density ($\rho_s$) across the pure nematic transition in extremely fine steps of ${\Delta}x$ = 0.0008. The temperature dependence of $\rho_s$ changes from the form of anisotropic pairing on the nematic side to an isotropic one across the critical doping $x_c$. The power-law dependence of gap anisotropy on $|x - x_c|$ provides evidence for nematic quantum criticality under the superconducting dome. The low-temperature $\rho_s$ scales linearly with Tc in the nematic phase $x < x_c$, whereas the gap amplitude, maximized at $x_c$, determines the Tc for $x>x_c$. Our results establish a pure nematic QCP in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, separating two superconducting orders with distinct pairing boosted by nematic quantum fluctuations.</p>

The Co, Ir, and Ni members of the series undergo magnetic ordering with decreasing transition temperatures. In contrast, the Pd compound does not magnetically order down to 0.4 K and shows non-Fermi liquid behavior, suggesting proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point. Among the series, Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ orders antiferromagnetically below $T_N=1.9$ K along with heavy-fermion behavior below 15 K. We report the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetic phase in Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ and the evolution of the magnetic transition under external pressure. Rietveld refinement of the neutron diffraction data suggests a coplanar antiferromagnetic structure with a wave vector $k = (1,1,1)$ and an ordered moment of $0.383 \pm 0.018 \> \mu_B$ in the antiferromagnetic phase. Electrical resistivity and AC calorimetry measurements under hydrostatic pressure reveal a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition toward zero temperature around $p=1.1$ GPa. However, there is no evidence of non-Fermi liquid behavior associated with the suppression of magnetism by pressure, unlike the effect of transition-metal substitution.</p>

            <p>Clarifying the impact of Fe doping on the structural and superconducting properties of MgB2 is crucial, considering that iron is commonly used as a sheath material for the fabrication of metal-clad MgB2 wires and tapes. To date the effects of Fe doping have only been investigated in polycrystalline samples, but the obtained results are controversial. Here, we report the successful growth of Mg1-xFexB2 single crystals in a quaternary Mg-Fe-B-N system using the cubic anvil high-pressure and high-temperature technique. The reaction took place in a closed boron nitride crucible at a pressure of 3 GPa and a temperature of 1960 °C. The grown crystals exhibit plate-like shapes with sizes up to 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.1 mm3. The variation of the critical temperature Tc of Mg1-xFexB2 crystals with Fe content was found to be different from that observed in polycrystalline samples. For a small Fe doping, up to x < 0.03, the behaviour of Tc(x) is similar to that for the crystals with Al and C substitutions, which suggests that Fe is in non-magnetic state. In this doping range, measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetization performed in high magnetic fields exclude spin states other than S = 0 for the Fe ions. However, for x > 0.03, certain crystals start to show a dramatic decrease in Tc, suggesting that Fe might be in a magnetic state. The M-H dependence for these crystals shows significant increase of magnetization with increasing field in low magnetic field, pointing to a weak ferromagnetism. Overall, the availability of Fe substituted MgB2 single crystals exhibiting such peculiar behaviour offers a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of disorder alone on one hand and the influence of magnetic substituent on the superconducting characteristics on the other.</p>

            <p>Topological Weyl semimetals represent a novel class of quantum materials that exhibit remarkable properties arising from their unique electronic structure. In this work, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio methods to investigate the role of the electron-phonon interactions on the charge transport properties of TaAs. Our calculations of the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity with the iterative Boltzmann transport equation show excellent agreement with experimental measurements above 100 K. Extending the analysis to doped systems, we demonstrate that even small shifts in the Fermi level can lead to substantial changes in conductivity, driven by the complex topology of the Fermi surface. In particular, modifications in Fermi surface nesting emerge as a key factor influencing scattering processes and carrier lifetimes. These findings offer critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport in TaAs and highlight the sensitivity of Weyl semimetals to doping and carrier dynamics.</p>

            <p>Topological edge states are robust against symmetry-preserving perturbations and noise, making them promising for quantum information and computation, particularly in topological quantum computation through braiding operations of Majorana quasiparticles. Realizing these applications requires fast and high-fidelity dynamic control of edge states. In this work, we theoretically propose a high-fidelity method for transferring one-dimensional topological edge states by dynamically moving a domain wall between regions of different topological numbers. This method fundamentally relies on Lorentz invariance and relativistic effects, as moving the domain wall at a constant speed results in the problem into the uniform linear motion of a particle obeying a Dirac equation. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method in transferring edge states with high fidelity using a one-dimensional quantum walk with two internal states, which is feasible with current experimental technology. We also investigate how bit and phase-flip dissipation from environment affects transfer efficiency. Remarkably, these dissipation have minimal effects on efficiency at slow and fast transfer limits, respectively, which can be explained by relativistic effects to the edge states.</p>

The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li-S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.</p>

            <h2>Synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ as a new prototype structure for ternary superhydrides recoverable at ambient pressure</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Caussé, L. Toraille, G. Geneste, P. Loubeyre</p>
            <p>Reaching pressures in the 100 GPa range enables the synthesis of hydrogen-rich compounds, with nontraditional H stoichiometries and H sublattices, called superhydrides. Record-breaking superconductivity temperature in some superhydrides have attracted great interest. A crucial next step is to stabilize superhydrides outside of high-pressure environments, leading to a search beyond binary hydrides to ternary hydrides. Here, we report the synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ at pressures starting at 60 GPa by compressing an hydrogenated Y-Fe compound, embedded in hydrogen in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction allowed us to resolve the Y$_3$Fe$_4$ lattice skeleton, and a constrained ab initio structural search was used to position the hydrogen atoms. FeH$_8$ cubic molecular units form building blocks which are connected edge-to-edge by sharing two hydrogen atoms, creating a framework that hosts Y cations. Remarkably, Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ maintains its structure through decompression, making it the first superhydride recovered metastable under ambient conditions.</p>

            <h2>Interfacial Effects Determine Nonequilibrium Phase Behaviors in Chemically Driven Fluids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yongick Cho, William M. Jacobs</p>
            <p>Coupling between chemical fuel consumption and phase separation can lead to condensation at a nonequilibrium steady state, resulting in phase behaviors that are not described by equilibrium thermodynamics. Theoretical models of such "chemically driven fluids" typically invoke near-equilibrium approximations at small length scales. However, because dissipation occurs due to both molecular-scale chemical reactions and mesoscale diffusive transport, it has remained unclear which properties of phase-separated reaction-diffusion systems can be assumed to be at an effective equilibrium. Here we use microscopic simulations to show that mesoscopic fluxes are dependent on nonequilibrium fluctuations at phase-separated interfaces. We further develop a first-principles theory to predict nonequilibrium coexistence curves, localization of mesoscopic fluxes near phase-separated interfaces, and droplet size-scaling relations in good agreement with simulations. Our findings highlight the central role of interfacial properties in governing nonequilibrium condensation and have broad implications for droplet nucleation, coarsening, and size control in chemically driven fluids.</p>

            <p>We employ first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of biphenylene supported on various metal substrates. The substrates considered are the (111) surfaces of Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Al, and the Cu$_3$Au alloy. Our results reveal how the interaction between biphenylene and the substrate governs its stability, degree of corrugation, electronic hybridization, and interfacial charge transfer. In particular, we observe a clear trend where weakly interacting metals preserve the intrinsic features of biphenylene, while more reactive substrates lead to significant structural and electronic modifications. We further evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of these systems, showing that certain metal supports, especially Pd, Pt, Ag, and Cu, can enhance the catalytic performance of biphenylene. Notably, Ag and Cu combine good catalytic activity with lower cost and chemical stability, offering a promising balance for practical applications. These findings provide insights into the design of biphenylene-metal interfaces, supporting their use in next-generation electronic and catalytic devices.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stands as one of the foremost utilized oxidizing agents in modern times. The established method for its production involves the intricate and costly anthraquinone process. However, a promising alternative pathway is the electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production, accomplished through the oxygen reduction reaction via a 2-electron pathway. This method not only simplifies the production process but also upholds environmental sustainability, especially when compared to the conventional anthraquinone method. In this review paper, recent works from the literature focusing on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction promoted by carbon electrocatalysts are summarized. The practical applications of these materials in the treatment of effluents contaminated with different pollutants (drugs, dyes, pesticides, and herbicides) are presented. Water treatment aiming to address these issues can be achieved through advanced oxidation electrochemical processes such as electro-Fenton, solar-electro-Fenton, and photo-electro-Fenton. These processes are discussed in detail in this work and the possible radicals that degrade the pollutants in each case are highlighted. The review broadens its scope to encompass contemporary computational simulations focused on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction, employing different models to describe carbon-based electrocatalysts. Finally, perspectives and future challenges in the area of carbon-based electrocatalysts for H2O2 electrogeneration are discussed. This review paper presents a forward-oriented viewpoint of present innovations and pragmatic implementations, delineating forthcoming challenges and prospects of this ever-evolving field.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A.F.Morais, M.C.Araújo, T.T.Saraiva, J. Furtado</p>
            <p>We studied a Lorentz-violating inspired Ginzburg-Landau model for superconductivity where we considered a CPT-odd contribution given by $(k_{AF})^{\mu}$, also known as the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. In the static limit of the equations, we could find a pair of modified Ginzburg-Landau equations. Furthermore, these equations were reduced to the London equation for the magnetic field when assumed that the characteristic length of the order parameter is much smaller than the characteristic length of the magnetic field, i.e. the London penetration length. Our numerical solutions showed a simple Meissner state when this new term is small compared to $\lambda_L$ and a phase transition into phases with strong in-plane currents and anomalous vortices for large contributions. This model becomes useful in exemplifying the changes in the phenomenology of superconductors when the setup of the system shows an important breakdown of Lorentz invariance. Based on these results, we discuss how such models might be the hallmark of unusual superconducting states where there is a direction where the system shows stratification, as in anapole superconductors UTe$_2$.</p>

            <p>The bulk-boundary correspondence plays a crucial role in topological quantum systems, however,this principle is broken in non-Hermitian systems. The breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence indicates that the global phase diagrams under open boundary conditions are significantly different from those under periodic boundary conditions. In this paper, we investigate how the bulk-boundary correspondence breaks down by gradually tearing the system. We find that by tuning the strength of gain and loss domain wall, in the thermodynamic limit, the global phase diagrams of the topological system become the hybrids of those under periodic and open boundary conditions. Moreover, during the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence, several phase transitions occur. This situation is quite different from earlier work, where the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence in the thermodynamic limit occurred suddenly due to infinitesimal boundary hopping amplitudes. To support our conclusions, we provide both analytical and numerical calculations. These results help researchers better understand non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

            <p>A plethora of next-generation all-optical devices based on exciton-polaritons have been proposed in latest years, including prototypes of transistors, switches, analogue quantum simulators and others. However, for such systems consisting of multiple polariton condensates, it is still challenging to predict their properties in a fast and accurate manner. The condensate physics is conventionally described by Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs). While GPU-based solvers currently exist, we propose a significantly more efficient machine-learning-based Fourier neural operator approach to find the solution to the GPE coupled with exciton rate equations, trained on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed method predicts solutions almost three orders of magnitude faster than CUDA-based solvers in numerical studies, maintaining the high degree of accuracy. Our method not only accelerates simulations but also opens the door to faster, more scalable designs for all-optical chips and devices, offering profound implications for quantum computing, neuromorphic systems, and beyond.</p>

            <p>Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel {\it polaromechanical} hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Huatian Hu, Zhiwei Hu, Christophe Galland, Wen Chen</p>
            <p>Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.</p>

This information is powerful enough to lead to a unique minimal topological order (or a small number of minimal topological orders). Almost all of the known experimentally discovered topological orders are these minimal theories. Since this work is interdisciplinary, we made a special effort to relate to people with different backgrounds by providing translations between different perspectives.</p>

            <p>Artificial Kitaev chains (AKCs), formed of quantum dot-superconductor linear arrays, provide a promising platform for hosting Majorana bound states (MBSs) and implementing topological quantum computing. The main challenges along this research direction would include the tuning up of AKCs for hosting MBSs and the readout of the parity of the chains. In this work, we present a step-by-step procedure for tuning up a three-site AKC to its sweet spots based on the spectra of a transmon circuit which is integrated with the chain for the purpose of reading out the parity of the chain. The signatures of the transmon's plasma modes in each step, particular those related to the appearance of MBSs in the chain, will be given. We find that the sweet spots in a three-site AKC can be classified into three types based on the relative strengths of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR): ECT-dominated sweet spots, genuine sweet spots and CAR-dominated sweet spots. We show that the ECT-dominated and CAR-dominated sweet spots can be more conveniently accessed and utilized in transmon-based measurements.</p>

We discuss how dynamical renormalization of the Mott-Hubbard gap feeds back into the photoexcitation process, modulating the carrier generation rate in real time. The momentum distribution of quasiparticle excitations immediately after the drive is calculated, and shown to contain valuable information about the generation mechanism.

            <p>Van der Waals materials have become a promising building block for future electronics and photonics. The two-dimensional magnet CrSBr came into the spotlight of solid state research due to its intriguing combination of antiferromagnetic order, strong light-matter coupling and unusual quasi-1D electronic bandstructure. This study reports the electrical excitation of excitons in CrSBr layers from cryogenic temperatures up to room temperature. By exploiting the energy transfer via tunneling electrons in a graphene tunnel junction strongly bound excitons are excited in proximate CrSBr layers. This facilitates electrically-excited emission from CrSBr crystals ranging in thickness from a bilayer up to 250 nm, in which the strong linear polarization of the electroluminescence confirms the excitonic origin. For thicker layers, clear evidence for the electrically excited emission from self-hybridized exciton polaritons is observed, highlighting the strong coupling between optical excitations and confined photon modes in CrSBr. These results pave the way for future applications in spintronic and optical readout of magnetic properties.</p>

            <p>Superconductivity usually emerges from a metallic normal state which follows the Fermi-liquid paradigm. If, in contrast, the normal state is a fractionalized non-Fermi liquid, then pairing may either eliminate fractionalization via a Higgs-type mechanism leading to a conventional superconducting state, or pairing can occur in the presence of fractionalization. Here we discuss a simple model for the latter case: Using a combination of perturbation theory and functional renormalization group, we show that the Kitaev--Kondo lattice model displays a fractionalized superconducting phase at weak Kondo coupling. This phase is characterized by Cooper pairing of conventional electronic quasiparticles, coexisting with a spin-liquid background and topological order. Depending on the sign of the Kitaev coupling, we find the pairing to be either of chiral $d$-wave or $p$-wave type for extended doping regions around the van-Hove filling. We discuss applications and extensions.</p>

            <p>Despite being a pillar of quantum mechanics, little attention has been paid to the onset of Fermi's golden rule as a discrete microscopic bath of modes approaches the macroscopic thermodynamic limit and forms a continuum. Motivated by recent experiments in circuit quantum electrodynamics, we tackle this question through the lens of single-photon decay in a finite transmission line coupled to a qubit ("quantum impurity"). We consider a single-photon state, coupled via the nonlinear impurity to several baths formed by multi-photon states with different number of photons, which are inherently discrete due to the finite size of the line. We focus on the late-time dynamics of the single-photon, and uncover the conditions under which the photon's decoherence rate approaches the decay rate predicted by Fermi's golden rule. We show that it is necessary to keep a small but finite escape rate (unrelated to the impurity) for each single-photon mode to obtain a finite long-time decay rate. We analyze the contribution of the baths formed by many-body states with different number of photons, and illustrate how the decay rate induced by some bath of $n$ photon states is enhanced by the presence of other baths of $m \neq n$ photon states, highlighting the contribution of cascade photon decay processes. Our formalism could be used to analyze recent experiments in superconducting circuits.</p>

            <p>We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses, one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects, we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the foundation for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Campos Venuti, Jovan Odavić, Alioscia Hamma</p>
            <p>We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</p>

Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive for hardware based machine learning.

These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures.

            <p>Previous investigations have revealed that the Weyl superconductor (WeylSC) and the two-dimensional (2D) nodal superconductor, realized through a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure, can exhibit a Dirac-like Landau level (LL) structure that scales with $\sqrt{n}$ in the presence of a vortex lattice, where $n$ is the index of the LLs. Here, we investigate the excitation spectrum in the mixed state of WeylSCs with unconventional pairing and find that, unlike in the spin-singlet case, QP bands for the spin-triplet pairing show surprising dispersion, except for the chiral symmetry-protected, dispersionless zeroth Landau level (ZLL). Different pairing symmetries in WeylSCs also result in distinct magneto-optical responses, manifested as characterized magneto-optical conductivity curves. We also reveal that, compared to the topologically protected, charge-neutral, localized Majorana zero mode (MZM), the chiral symmetry-protected ZLL is non-charge-neutral and delocalized. Both of these zero modes may be observed in the vortex of a superconductor heterostructure.</p>

            <p>Detecting individual light quanta is essential for quantum information, space exploration, advanced machine vision, and fundamental science. Here, we introduce a novel single photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive non-equilibrium electron phases in moiré materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal-boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 microns) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometres) and temperatures up to 25 K. This detector offers new prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with CMOS compatibility and seamless integration into photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Our analysis suggests the mechanism underlying our device operation originates from negative differential velocity, and represents an important milestone in the field of high-bias transport in two-dimensional moiré quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Active-Spin-State-Derived Descriptor for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Catalysis</h2>

            <p>Spin states are pivotal in modulating the electrocatalytic activity of transition-metal (TM)-based compounds, yet quantitatively evaluating the activity-spin state correlation remains a formidable challenge. Here, we propose an 'activity index n' as a descriptor, to assess the activity of the spin states for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). n descriptor integrates three key electronic parameters: the proportion (P), broadening range (R) and center cc of active spin state, which collectively account for the electronic structure modulation induced by both the intrinsic active site and its local coordination environment. Using 1T-phase ZrSe2-anchored TM atoms (TM=Sc to Ni) as prototypes, we reveal that the correlation between Gibbs free energy and the n value follows a linear relation, namely, the vGH reduces as the n decreases. Notably, ZrSe2-Mn exhibits the optimal n value (-0.56), corresponding the best HER activity with a vGH of 0.04 eV closer to the thermoneutral ideal value (0 eV) than even Pt (vGH = -0.09 eV). This relationship suggests that n is the effective descriptor of active spin state for HER of TM-based catalysts. Our study brings fundamental insights into the HER activity-spin state correlation, offering new strategies for HER catalyst design.</p>

            <h2>Substrate Effect on Electronic Band Structure and Topological Property in Monolayer V2O3 Magnetic Topological Insulator</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zheng Wang, Kaixuan Chen, Shu-Shen Lyu</p>
            <p>Monolayer V2O3, a two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and a nontrivial band gap, offers a promising platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the impact of substrate selection on its electronic and topological properties. By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> I. Yu. Chestnov, A. Kudlis, A. V. Nalitov, I. A. Shelykh</p>
            <p>We theoretically investigate the interplay between Zeeman splitting and TE-TM-induced spin-flip tunneling in coupled exciton-polariton condensates systems and its impact on the spin-Meissner effect. We demonstrate that although a single condensate exhibits the effect of full paramagnetic screening via spin-anisotropic interactions, the inter-site spin-flip tunneling can dramatically alter this behavior. The geometry of the system is shown to play a crucial role. In particular, in a dyad, the chemical potential reveals quadratic scaling with the magnetic field. In a triangle, the competition between Zeeman and TE-TM splittings produces a rich phase diagram that features asymmetric polarization states corresponding to both positive and negative magnetic susceptibility. In a square configuration, the symmetry of the network can restore the spin-Meissner effect, so that the condensate emission frequency becomes magnetic field independent in an extended parameter range. These findings not only shed light on the fundamental physics of polariton lattices but also suggest promising avenues for engineering robust spin-controlled photonic devices and polaritonic simulators.</p>

            <p>Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which fluctuations enhance an otherwise weak signal. It has been found in many different systems in paleoclimatology, biology, medicine, and physics. The classical stochastic resonance due to thermal noise has recently been experimentally extended to the quantum regime, where the fundamental randomness of individual quantum events provides the noise source. Here, we demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance in the single-electron tunneling dynamics of a periodically driven single-photon emitter, consisting of a self-assembled quantum dot that is tunnel-coupled to an electron reservoir. Such highly-controllable quantum emitters are promising candidates for future applications in quantum information technologies. We monitor the charge dynamics by resonant optical excitation and identify quantum stochastic resonance with the help of full counting statistics of tunneling events in terms of the Fano factor and extend the statistical evaluation to factorial cumulants to gain a deeper understanding of this far-reaching phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Topological electron and phonon flat bands in novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiefeng Ye, Zhigao Huang, Xianxin Wu, Jian-Min Zhang</p>
            <p>Fermionic and bosonic localized states induced by geometric frustration in the kagome lattice provide a distinctive research platform for investigating emergent exotic quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Here, we report the discovery of coexisting electronic and phononic flat bands induced by geometric frustration in a novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba). The electronic flat band is located around the Fermi level and possesses a nontrivial topological invariant with Z2=1. Additionaly, we identify multiple van Hove singularities (vHS) arise from the kagome Pd d orbitals with distinct dispersion and sublattice features, including conventional, higher-order vHS and p-type, m-type vHS. Specifically, our investigation of the vibrational modes of the phononic flat band reveals that its formation originates from destructive interference between adjacent kagome lattice sites with antiphase vibrational modes. A spring-mass model of phonons is established to probe the physical mechanism of the phononic flat bands. Furthermore, the calculations of electron-phonon coupling in the XPd5 reveal superconducting ground states with critical temperatures (Tc) of 4.25 K, 2.75 K, and 3.35 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. This work provides a promising platform to explore the Fermion-boson many-body interplay and superconducting states, while simultaneously establishing a novel analytical framework to elucidate the origin of phononic flat bands in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Infrared markers of topological phase transitions in quantum spin Hall insulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Paolo Fachin, Francesco Macheda, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri</p>
            <p>Using first principles techniques, we show that infrared optical response can be used to discriminate between the topological and the trivial phases of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). We showcase germanene and jacutingaite, of recent experimental realization, as prototypical systems where the infrared spectrum is discontinuous across the transition, due to sudden and large discretized jumps of the value of Born effective charges (up to 2). For these materials, the topological transition can be induced via the application of an external electrostatic potential in the field-effect setup. Our results are rationalized in the framework of a low-energy Kane-Mele model and are robust with respect to dynamical effects which come into play when the energy gap of the material is of the same order of the infrared active phonon frequency. In the small gap QSHI germanene, due to dynamical effects, the in-plane phonon resonance in the optical conductivity shows a Fano profile with remarkable differences in the intensity and the shape between the two phases. Instead, the large gap QSHI jacutingaite presents several IR-active phonon modes whose spectral intensities drastically change between the two phases.</p>

            <h2>Electrical manipulation of magnetic domain structure in van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ using ferroelectric PMN-PT single crystal</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Riku Iimori, Yuta Kodani, Shaojie Hu, Takashi Kimura</p>
            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as promising materials for spintronic applications due to their unique magnetic properties and tunability. Controlling ferromagnetism via external stimuli is critical for both fundamental research and device integration. In particular, modulation of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions through strain offers a viable pathway for functional control. Owing to their weak interlayer coupling, vdW ferromagnets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to strain, enabling effective tuning of their magnetic states. In this study, we investigate electric-field-induced magnetoelectric coupling in the above-room-temperature vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ integrated on a ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. We demonstrate that application of an electric field leads to a substantial reduction in coercive force along with dynamic reconfiguration of the magnetic domain structure. These effects are attributed to electric-field-induced modulation of the vdW interlayer gap and enhancement of the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction. Our findings reveal a strong interplay between electric fields and magnetism in vdW systems, offering a viable route toward the development of low-power, multifunctional magnetic devices. This work establishes a foundation for the electric-field control of magnetic properties in vdW ferromagnets and highlights their potential in next-generation spintronic technologies.</p>

            <p>MnBi2nTe3n+1 (MBT) is a representative family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, in which numerous exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect are expected. The high-quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here we develop a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback-regulated strategy, which provides the closed-loop control of growth temperature within +/- 0.1 degree Celsius. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold-end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state is also realized at the low field of 3.7 T. Our results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MBT family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jacopo Gliozzi, Federico Balducci, Taylor L. Hughes, Giuseppe De Tomasi</p>
            <p>We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Heng Ji, Chen Lu, Zhi-Yan Shao, Zhiming Pan, Fan Yang, Congjun Wu</p>
            <p>Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</p>

            <h2>Analytic solution for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large-amplitude oscillatory fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick Ilg</p>
            <p>Nonlinear responses of physical systems to strong perturbations are notoriously difficult to tackle analytically. Here, we present analytic results for the nonlinear response of magnetic nanoparticles to large amplitude oscillatory magnetic fields based on a particular model for the magnetization dynamics. A number of characteristic features of the in-phase and out-of-phase higher-harmonic response are found and analyzed. In particular we find that the magnitude of higher harmonic contributions Rn depends on the field amplitude and frequency only via a single scaling variable that combines the two quantities. The decrease of |Rn|with increasing order nof harmonics is a key quantity monitored in biomedical applications such as magnetic particle spectroscopy and magnetic particle imaging. Except for the first few harmonics, we find that this decrease is exponential with a rate that depends on the scaling variable only. For not too high frequencies and not loo large amplitudes, we find that these exact results for one particular model of magnetization dynamics hold approximately also for other, more frequently used models. Our results therefore offer not only deeper insight into strongly nonlinear responses of magnetic nanoparticles, especially for higher harmonics that are very difficult to determine numerically, but also suggest analyzing data in terms of a scaling variable.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andreas Tsantilas, Trithep Devakul, Julian May-Mann</p>
            <p>We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of "double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moiré twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.</p>

            <p>The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</p>

            <p>Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.</p>

The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.</p>

            <p>Self-propelled active particles exhibit delayed responses to environmental changes, modulating their propulsion speed through intrinsic sensing and feedback mechanisms. This adaptive behavior fundamentally determines their dynamics and self-organization in active matter systems, with implications for biological microswimmers and engineered microrobots. Here, we investigate active Brownian particles whose propulsion speed is governed by spatially varying activity landscapes, incorporating a temporal delay between environmental sensing and speed adaptation. Through analytical solutions derived for both short-time and long-time delay regimes, we demonstrate that steady-state density and polarization profiles exhibit maxima at characteristic delays. Significantly, we observe that the polarization profile undergoes sign reversal when the swimming distance during the delay time exceeds the characteristic diffusion length, providing a novel mechanism for controlling particle transport without external fields. Our theoretical predictions, validated through experimental observations and numerical simulations, establish time delay as a crucial control parameter for particle transport and organization in active matter systems. These findings provide insights into how biological microorganisms might use response delays to gain navigation advantages and suggest design principles for synthetic microswimmers with programmable responses to heterogeneous environments.</p>

            <p>Understanding and predicting the adhesive properties of viscoelastic Hertzian contacts is crucial for diverse engineering applications, including robotics, biomechanics, and advanced material design. The maximum adherence force of a Hertzian indenter unloaded from a viscoelastic substrate has been studied with analytical and numerical models. Analytical models are valid within their assumptions, numerical methods offer precision but can be computationally expensive, necessitating alternative solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-augmented machine learning (PA-ML) framework as a hybrid approach, bridging the gap between analytical models and data-driven solutions, which is capable of rapidly predicting the pull-off force in an Hertzian profile unloaded from a broad band viscoelastic material, with varying Tabor parameter, preload and retraction rate. Compared to previous models, the PA-ML approach provides fast yet accurate predictions in a wide range of conditions, properly predicting the effective surface energy and the work-to-pull-off. The integration of the analytical model provides critical guidance to the PA-ML framework, supporting physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that physics augmentation enhances predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error (MSE) while increasing model efficiency and interpretability. We provide data-driven and PA-ML models for real-time predictions of the adherence force in soft materials like silicons and elastomers opening to the possibility to integrate PA-ML into materials and interface design. The models are openly available on Zenodo and GitHub.</p>

            <p>Biphenylene nanotubes (BPNNTs) represent a novel class of carbon-based nanomaterials, constructed by rolling a biphenylene network (BPN) monolayer into a one-dimensional tubular structure. In this study, the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs are investigated using reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. At room temperature, the lattice thermal conductivity of armchair and zigzag BPNNTs is found to be approximately 100 W/m.K and 90 W/m.K, respectively. These values are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). This significant reduction is attributed to the unique atomic arrangement of BPNNTs, which promotes enhanced phonon scattering and significantly lower phonon group velocity. Furthermore, the effects of nanotube length, diameter, and temperature on thermal transport are systematically analyzed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the geometry- and temperature-dependent thermal behavior, a comprehensive analysis of phonon dispersion relations, vibrational density of states, and phonon group velocities is conducted. This study offers valuable insight into the thermal transport properties of BPNNTs, with implications for thermal management and energy-related applications.</p>

We found emergent spectral features in both the occupied (ARPES) and unoccupied states (AR-IPES), which are likely induced by charge fluctuations.

These copolymer-based bilayers serve as biomimetic platforms with applications in areas such as drug delivery. Our simulations identify a minimum free energy configuration characterized by phospholipid tails tilted relative to the membrane normal. The model quantitatively captures the well-known area condensation effect as cholesterol concentration increases, along with membrane thickening and reduced tilt angle. Thermodynamically, we observe a linear dependence between cholesterol's chemical potential and its concentration within the 37-50% range, consistent with experimental results. Additionally, we analyze the effects of block copolymer length and headgroup interactions on bilayer structure. Interactions between phospholipid headgroups and the solvent emerge as the most influential. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding cholesterol's regulatory role in membrane structure and mechanics.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of cross-layer composite spins in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure and possible routes to enhance its superconductivity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruoshi Jiang, Zhiyu Fan, Bartomeu Monserrat, Wei Ku</p>
            <p>Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has been recently found to exhibit superconductivity in its high-pressure phase, similar to the previously discovered bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but with a notably lower transition temperature. To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</p>

            <h2>Mesoscopic Hamiltonian for Josephson travelling-wave parametric amplifiers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T.H.A. van der Reep</p>
            <p>We present a theory describing parametric amplification in a Josephson junction embedded transmission line. We will focus on the process of four-wave mixing under the assumption of an undepleted pump. However, the approach taken is quite general, such that a different parametric process or the process under different assumptions is easily derived. First the classical theory of the coupled-mode equations as presented by O'Brien et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{113}:157001$] is shortly reviewed. Then a derivation of the full quantum theory is given using mesoscopic quantisation techniques in terms of discrete mode operators. This results in a Hamiltonian that describes the process of parametric amplification. We show that the coupled-mode equations can be derived from this Hamiltonian in the classical limit and elaborate on the validity of the theory.</p>

            <p>The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zijian Liang, Yijia Xu, Joseph T. Iosue, Yu-An Chen</p>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Yan, Qian Wang, Marko Robnik</p>
            <p>By using the Krylov subspace technique to generate the spin coherent states in kicked top model, a prototype model for studying quantum chaos, the accessible system size for studying the Husimi functions of eigenstates can be much larger than that reported in the literature and our previous study Phys. Rev. E 108, 054217 (2023) [arXiv:2308.04824]. In the fully chaotic kicked top, we find that the mean Wehrl entropy localization measure approaches the prediction given by the Circular Unitary Ensemble. In the mixed-type case, we identify mixed eigenstates by the overlap of the Husimi function with regular and chaotic regions in classical compact phase space. Numerically, we show that the fraction of mixed eigenstates scales as $j^{-\zeta}$, a power-law decay as the system size $j$ increases, across nearly two orders of magnitude. This provides supporting evidence for the principle of uniform semiclassical condensation of Husimi functions and the Berry-Robnik picture in the semiclassical limit.</p>

            <h2>Modeling Structured Data Learning with Restricted Boltzmann Machines in the Teacher-Student Setting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Robin Thériault, Francesco Tosello, Daniele Tantari</p>
            <p>Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are generative models capable to learn data with a rich underlying structure. We study the teacher-student setting where a student RBM learns structured data generated by a teacher RBM. The amount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hidden units of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a. patterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that the performance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units of the student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used as a toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, we find that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patterns decreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we find that, even with a relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn the teacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kept too low. In our framework, the student can learn teacher patterns one-to-one or many-to-one, generalizing previous findings about the teacher-student setting with two hidden units to any arbitrary finite number of hidden units.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michael Reitz, Arghadip Koner, Joel Yuen-Zhou</p>
            <p>We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max McGinley, Wen Wei Ho, Daniel Malz</p>
            <p>We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vishnu Muraleedharan Sajitha, Bodhaditya Santra, Matthew J. Davis, L. A. Williamson</p>
            <p>We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</p>

            <p>We report on tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at 10 K. The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at subnanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and an Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant redshift of the H-H stretch frequency is observed as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.</p>

            <p>Symmetry-resolved entanglement, capturing the refined structure of quantum entanglement in systems with global symmetries, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this manuscript, introducing the notion of symmetry-resolved generalized entropies, we aim to develop a computational framework suitable for the study of excited state symmetry-resolved entanglement as well as the dynamical evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement in symmetry-preserving out-of-equilibrium settings. We illustrate our framework using the example of (1+1)-d free massless compact boson theory, and benchmark our results using lattice computation in the XX chain. As a byproduct, our computational framework also provides access to the probability distribution of the symmetry charge contained within a subsystem and the corresponding full counting statistics.</p>

            <p>We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeehye Choi, Byungjoon Min, Tobias Galla</p>
            <p>In traditional voter models, opinion dynamics are driven by interactions between individuals, where an individual adopts the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. However, these models often fail to capture the emergence of entirely new opinions, which can arise spontaneously in real-world scenarios. Our study introduces a novel element to the classic voter model: the concept of innovation, where individuals have a certain probability of generating new opinions independently of their neighbors' states. This innovation process allows for a more realistic representation of social dynamics, where new opinions can emerge and old ones may fade over time. Through analytical and numerical analysis, we find that the balance between innovation and extinction shapes the number of opinions in the steady state. Specifically, for low innovation rates, the system tends toward near-consensus, while higher innovation rates lead to greater opinion diversity. We also show that network structure influences opinion dynamics, with greater degree heterogeneity reducing the number of opinions in the system.</p>

            <p>Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Introducing and varying parameters in such systems leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossing a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters. As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the "topology breaks down". We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka. winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These realize the lower bound on the number of Dirac points necessary obtained from viewing them as local charges. We treat several concrete models and show that they have the predicted generic behavior. In particular, we focus on different types of lattices and tight-binding models, and show that effective winding maps, and thus higher Chern numbers, can be achieved using k-th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. Our study includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices.</p>

            <p>Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Biplab Pal</p>
            <p>Fractal geometries exhibit complex structures with scale invariance self-similar pattern over various length scales. An artificially designed quantum fractal geometry embedded in a uniform magnetic flux has been explored in this study. It has been found that due to quantum mechanical effect, such quantum fractal display an exotic electronic property which is reflected in its transport characteristics. Owing to this uniform magnetic flux piercing through each closed-loop building block of the fractal structure, an electron traversing through such a fractal geometry will pick up a nontrivial Aharonov-Bohm phase factor, which will influence its transport through the system. It is shown that, one can completely block the transmission of an electron in this fractal geometry by setting the value of the uniform magnetic flux to half flux quantum. This phenomenon of Aharonov-Bohm caging of an electron in this quantum fractal geometry has been supported by the computation of the energy spectrum, two-terminal transport and persistent current in its various generations. This result is very robust against disorder and could be useful in designing efficient quantum algorithms using a quantum fractal network.</p>

            <p>This study investigates the interplay between Strong Coupling (SC) attraction and hydration repulsion in nanoconfined water between like-charged phospholipid layers. It challenges the assumption that SC attraction requires multivalent counterions by showing that hydration water can enhance electrostatic interactions. We combine reflectivities with numerical simulations to analyze supported phospholipid layers under different relative humidity and surface charge densities. X-ray fluorescence demonstrates that we can control the valence of the associated counterions. Experimental measurement of the water thickness, combined with precise determination of charged surface positions by numerical simulations, enable us to compare our experiments with a theoretical model. It shows that charge-screening by hydration water induces SC attraction, even at moderate surface charge densities with monovalent counterions. Furthermore, hydration repulsion is stronger for DPPS compared to DPPC. These findings offer insights into the forces that control interactions between phospholipid layers and have important implications for biological and colloidal systems.</p>

            <p>The activation free energy of electron transfer (ET) reactions is governed by a crucial parameter: the reorganization energy. In heterogeneous ET at electrified solid-liquid interfaces, it is presumed that only factors in the electrolyte phase are responsible for determining the reorganization energy. Here, we demonstrate the contribution of the electronic density of states (DOS) of the electrode to the reorganization energy. Using van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals, we tune the DOS of graphene and measure its impact on outer-sphere ET. We find the ensuing variation in ET rate arises from modulation in a reorganization energy associated with image potential localization in the electrode, which is dependent on the DOS.

            <p>Photon magnon hybrid systems present a promising platform for the development of next generation devices in quantum information processing and quantum sensing technologies. In this study, we investigate the control of photon magnon coupling (PMC) strength through systematic variation of the saturation magnetization in a planar hexagonal ring resonator (HRR) integrated with a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film configuration. Using full wave numerical simulations in CST Microwave Studio, we demonstrate that tuning the Ms of the YIG film from 1750 Oe to 900 Oe enables systematic control over the coupling strength across the 127 to 51 MHz range at room temperature. To explain the observed PMC dynamics, we develop a semiclassical analytical model based on electromagnetic theory that accurately reproduces the observed coupling behavior, revealing the key role of spin density in mediating the light matter interaction. The model is further extended to include the effects of variable magnon damping across different Ms values, enabling broader frequency control. These findings establish Ms as a key tuning parameter for tailoring PMC, with direct implications for the design of tunable hybrid systems for reconfigurable quantum devices.</p>

            <p>Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride, successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase P21m BiH2 exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 70 K among MH2type hydrides apart from H2S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for P21m and C2m BiH2 indicate that the upper critical fields miu0Hc2(0) is 12 to 16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar Tc. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH2, about 1.1 106 m s, which allows to classify BiH2 as a soft molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum Jc(0) is 10 kA mm2), which indicates the presence of two s wave superconducting gaps in BiH2 at 172 to 176 GPa: deltaL(0) is 6.9 1.2 meV and deltaS(0) is 1.5 meV.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity and phase diagram in Sr-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</h2>

            <p>Recent studies have demonstrated ambient pressure superconductivity in compressively strained La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ thin films, yet the phase diagram of heterovalent doping$-$critical for advancing the field$-$remains unexplored. Here, we report superconductivity in Sr$^{2+}$-doped La$_{3-x}$Sr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy with ozone-assisted post-annealing. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) follows an asymmetric dome-like profile, persisting across a wide doping range ($0 \leq x \leq 0.21$) before diminishing at $x \approx 0.38$. Optimally doped films ($x = 0.09$) achieve $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of $\sim$ 42 K, with high critical current ($J_{\mathrm{c}} > 1.4$ $\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 2 K) and upper critical fields ($\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\parallel}}(0)= 83.7$ $\mathrm{T}$, $\mu_{0}H_{\mathrm{c,\perp}}(0)= 110.3$ $\mathrm{T}$), comparable to reported La$_{3-x}$Pr$_{x}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals oxygen vacancies predominantly occupy at planar NiO$_{2}$ sites$-$unlike apical-site vacancies in bulk samples$-$due to Coulomb repulsion destabilizing planar oxygen under compressive strain. Additionally, the elongated out-of-plane Ni-O bonds, exceeding those in pressurized bulk samples by $4\%$, likely weaken the interlayer $d_{z^2}$ coupling, thus contributing to the reduced $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in strained films. This work establishes heterovalent Sr$^{2+}$ doping as a robust tuning parameter for nickelate superconductivity, unveiling a unique phase diagram topology.</p>

            <p>The interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in low-dimensional systems is a cornerstone of modern spintronics, where achieving all-electrical control of spin currents is a major goal. Spin-orbit interactions provide a promising mechanism for such control, yet understanding how spin and charge transport emerge from microscopic principles remains a fundamental challenge. Here we develop a spin-dependent scattering matrix approach to describe spin and charge transport in a multiterminal system in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Our framework generalizes the Büttiker formalism by offering explicit real-space expressions for spin and charge current densities, along with the corresponding linear response function. It simultaneously captures the effects of quantum confinement, the orbital response to external magnetic fields, and the intrinsic (geometric) properties of the electronic bands, offering a comprehensive description of the spin-charge interconversion mechanisms at play in a Hall bar, in agreement with experiments.</p>

            <h2>Hydrogen Bond Topology Reveals Layering of LDL-like and HDL-like Water at its Liquid/Vapor Interface</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pal Jedlovszky, Christoph Dellago, Marcello Sega</p>
            <p>The discovery of high-density liquid (HDL) and low-density liquid (LDL) water has been a major success of molecular simulations, yet extending this analysis to interfacial water is challenging due to conventional order parameters assuming local homogeneity. This limitation previously prevented resolving the composition of the surface layer of the liquid/vapour interface. Here, we apply a recently introduced topological order parameter [R. Foffi and F. Sciortino, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 378-386 (2022)] to analyze the composition of the water/vapor interface across a broad temperature range. Our results reveal that LDL-like water dominates the outermost region at all temperatures, while HDL-like water accumulates beneath it, presenting a clear layering roughly below the temperature of maximum density. This structured stratification, previously inaccessible, highlights the power of the topological order parameter in resolving interfacial molecular heterogeneity and provides new insights into the structural properties of water at interfaces.</p>

            <p>Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic order, combines zero net magnetization with non-relativistic spin splitting of electronic bands. Its ability to utilize the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets is highly promising for spintronic applications. Currently, the merge of altermagnetism and weak ferromagnetism in a single material excites significant interest as it provides additional control mechanisms over material properties. However, the role of dimensionality in this interplay is yet to be explored. Here, we study magnetism and electron transport in epitaxial films of the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe ranging from bulklike to a single monolayer. The films exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and negative magnetoresistance. In contrast to altermagnetic GdAlSi, the candidate altermagnet GdAlGe demonstrates an admixture of the ferromagnetic state which contribution increases as the system approaches the 2D limit. The coexistence of the magnetic states induces technologically important intrinsic exchange bias. The present work underpins future studies and applications of nanoscale altermagnets.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> N.V. Antonov, P.I. Kakin, N.M. Lebedev, A.Yu. Luchin</p>
            <p>We study a strongly anisotropic self-organized critical system coupled to an isotropic random fluid environment. The former is described by a continuous (coarse-grained) model due to Hwa and Kardar. The latter is modeled by the Navier--Stokes equation with a random stirring force of a rather general form that includes, in particular, the overall shaking of the system and a non-local part with power-law spectrum $\sim k^{4-d-y}$ that describes, in the limiting case $y \to 4$, a turbulent fluid. The full problem of the two coupled stochastic equations is represented as a field theoretic model which is shown to be multiplicatively renormalizable and logarithmic at $d=4$. Due to the interplay between isotropic and anisotropic interactions, the corresponding renormalization group (RG) equations reveal a rich pattern of possible infrared (large scales, long times) regimes of asymptotic behaviour of various Green's functions. The attractors of the RG equations in the five-dimensional space of coupling parameters include a two-dimensional surface of Gaussian (free) fixed points, a single fixed point that corresponds to the plain advection by the turbulent fluid (the Hwa--Kardar self-interaction is irrelevant) and a one-dimensional curve of fixed points that corresponds to the case where the Hwa--Kardar nonlinearity and the uniform stirring are simultaneously relevant. The character of attractiveness is determined by the exponent $y$ and the dimension of space $d$; the most interesting case $d=3$ and $y \to 4$ is described by the single fixed point. The corresponding critical dimensions of the frequency and the basic fields are found exactly.</p>

            <h2>Disorder-Driven Exceptional Points and Concurrent Topological Phase Transitions in Non-Hermitian Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiaoyu Cheng, Tiantao Qu, Yaqing Yang, Lei Zhang, Jun Chen</p>
            <p>Exceptional point (EP) and topological phase transition (TPT) in non-Hermitian systems have recently garnered significant attention owing to their fundamental importance and potential applications in sensing and topological devices. Beyond the EP induced by non-reciprocal hopping, we show that random disorder can also drive the valence and conduction bands across EPs, even twice in the non-Hermitian regime. Remarkably, a TPT can occur concurrently with an EP as disorder strength increases. These disorder-driven EPs and concurrent TPTs are well captured by effective medium theory. The analysis reveals that their emergence results from the interplay between disorder-induced energy level renormalization and non-reciprocal hopping-induced inter-level coupling, which fundamentally restructures the spectral properties of the system. The phase diagram in the parameter space of non-reciprocal hopping and disorder strength identifies robust EP lines. Interestingly, two EP lines can emerge from the TPT point in the Hermitian limit. As non-reciprocal hopping increases, these lines split, with one aligning the TPT, leading to distinct disorder-induced EPs. Our results uncover a robust, disorder-driven mechanism for generating EPs and concurrent TPTs, offering a new direction for exploring non-Hermitian topological matter.</p>

The obtained power laws are different from conventional behavior, and unconventional superconductivity in twisted multilayer graphene is discussed.

In this work, we explore the first continuously tunable family of two-dimensional aperiodic tilings in which the underlying real-space geometry becomes a control knob of the wave-function's quantum geometric tensor. The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.</p>

            <p>Diffusion in heterogeneous energy and diffusivity landscapes is widespread in biological systems. However, solving the Langevin equation in such environments introduces ambiguity due to the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, which depends on the underlying physics and can take values in the range $0<\alpha<1$. The typical interpretations are Itô ($\alpha=0$), Stratonovich ($\alpha=1/2$), and Hänggi-Klimontovich ($\alpha=1$). Here, we analyse the motion of a particle in an harmonic potential -- modelled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process -- with diffusivity that varies in space. Our focus is on two-phase systems with a discontinuity in environmental properties at $x=0$. We derive the probability density of the particle position for the process, and consider two paradigmatic situations. In the first one, the damping coefficient remains constant, and fluctuation-dissipation relations are not satisfied. In the second one, these relations are enforced, leading to a position-dependent damping coefficient. In both cases, we provide solutions as a function of the interpretation parameter $\alpha$, with particular attention to the Itô, Stratonovich, and Hänggi-Klimontovich interpretations, revealing fundamentally different behaviours, in particular with respect to an interface located at the potential minimum.</p>

By calculating the excited electron distributions based on ab-initio band structure data, we show how this excited electronic spin response in $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits different symmetries which are determined by the nodal planes intrinsic to the bulk g-wave altermagnet. We present a simple procedure to obtain the symmetry of the electronic spin response from the two-dimensional cuts through the three-dimensional band structure.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we present an application of the variational quantum simulation (VQS) framework to capture finite-temperature open-system dynamics on near-term quantum hardware. By embedding the generalized amplitude-damping channel into the VQS algorithm, we modeled the energy exchange with a thermal bath through its Lindblad representation and thereby simulated realistic dissipative effects. To explore a wide range of activation behaviors, we introduce a nonadditive relaxation-time model using a generalized form of the Arrhenius law, based on the phenomenological parameter q. We compare our method on a driven qubit subject to both static and composite time-dependent fields, comparing population evolution and trace distance errors against exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that (i) VQS accurately maps the effective nonunitary generator under generalized amplitude damping, (ii) smoother drive envelopes induced by nonaddtive parameters suppress high frequency components and yield lower simulation errors, and (iii) the variational manifold exhibits dynamical selectivity, maintaining mapping fidelity even as the exact solution's sensitivity to q increases.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesco D'Amico, Dario Bocchi, Matteo Negri</p>
            <p>Scaling laws in deep learning - empirical power-law relationships linking model performance to resource growth - have emerged as simple yet striking regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training or on the optimal training time given the model size. In this work, we uncover a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics through the lens of spectral complexity norms. We identify two novel dynamical scaling laws that govern how performance evolves during training. These laws together recover the well-known test error scaling at convergence, offering a mechanistic explanation of generalization emergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a solvable model: a single-layer perceptron trained with binary cross-entropy. In this setting, we show that the growth of spectral complexity driven by the implicit bias mirrors the generalization behavior observed at fixed norm, allowing us to connect the performance dynamics to classical learning rules in the perceptron.</p>

We explore the scaling relations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in finite-time first-order phase transitions. Using the Curie-Weiss model as an example, for large systems we find the excess work scales as $v^{2/3}$ when the magnetic field is quenched at a finite rate $v$ across the phase transition. We further reveal a crossover in the scaling of the excess work from $v^{2/3}$ to $v$ when downsizing the system. Our study elucidates the interplay between the finite-time dynamics and the finite-size effect, which leads to different scaling behaviors of the excess work with or without ergodicity breaking.</p>

            <p>We study a three-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori model relevant for iron-based superconductors using variational wave functions explicitly including spatial correlations and electron pairing. We span the nonmagnetic sector from filling $n=4$, which is representative of undoped iron-based superconductors, to $n=3$, where a Mott insulating state with each orbital at half filling is found. In the strong-coupling regime, when the electron density is increased, we find a spontaneous differentiation between the occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, leading to an orbital-selective state with a nematic character that becomes stronger at increasing density. One of these orbitals stays half-filled for all densities while the other one hosts (together with the $d_{xy}$ orbital) the excess of electron density. Most importantly, in this regime long-range pairing correlations appear in the orbital with the largest occupation. Our results highlight a strong link between orbital-selective correlations, nematicity, and superconductivity, which requires the presence of a significant Hund's coupling.</p>

            <p>Understanding the chemical state of individual ions in solutions is crucial for advancing knowledge of complex chemical systems. However, analyzing systems at the single-ion level in liquid environments remains a significant challenge. We present a strategy that leverages the optical emission properties of point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as sensitive ion detectors. The interaction of optically active h-BN defects with ions in solution leads to distinct spectral shifts, enabling precise visualization and analyzing of individual ions. Using Li+ ions in organic electrolytes as a model, we observed spectral shifts exceeding 10 nm upon ion addition. Application of an external electric field further enhanced these shifts to over 40 nm, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical field induced local perturbations of Li+ ions. Following this approach, we showed that each individual single point defect can be used to spectroscopically distinguish ions of varying charges (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, and Al3+) based on their local electric fields, each producing a distinct spectral shift. This platform allows direct visualization of ions and their chemical states in liquid environments, providing insights into subtle interfacial changes at the single-ion level, with measurable spectral shifts detectable at millisecond temporal resolution and at concentrations down to the millimolar range. This capability presents potential applications in various fields involving ions in liquids that include battery technology and environmental science.</p>

            <p>The abundance of bulk and boundary topologies in higher-order topological phases offer remarkable tunability and diversity to boundary states but also pose a challenge to their unified topological characterization. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to characterize time-reversal invariant topological superconductors hosting Majorana Kramers pairs (MKP) of corner states by using a series of spin Bott indices, which capture both bulk and boundary states topology. The developed invariants can characterize MKP in arbitrarily shaped systems and all distinct spatial distribution patterns of MKP. As an illustrative example, we apply our theory to analyze the Kane-Mele model with sublattice-dependent superconducting pairing potentials. In this representative model, both intrinsic and extrinsic higher-order topological superconductors can be realized and various patterns of MKP can be engineered through edge cleavage. Despite their high sensitivity to boundary terminations, MKP can be faithfully characterized by the proposed topological this http URL further demonstrate the characterization of higher-order topological superconductors in the BDI symmetry class using Bott indices without resolving the spin degree of freedom.</p>

The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for an associated coherent system. The dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. In particular, this leads to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression -- in the NESS spectrum -- of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.</p>

We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of \textit{Fermi surface nesting}, we show that superconductivity can emerge near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the $p+ip$, $h+ih$, and the nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in {a narrow stripe shape of superconducting region}, consistent with experimental findings. We point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation with a dominant $p+ip$ pairing. The possibility of realizing intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in other rhombohedral graphene systems is also discussed.</p>

            <p>Resetting has been shown to reduce the completion time for a stochastic process, such as the first passage time for a diffusive searcher to find a target. The time between two consecutive resetting events is drawn from a waiting time distribution $\psi(t)$, which defines the resetting protocol. Previously, it has been shown that deterministic resetting process with a constant time period, referred to as sharp restart, can minimize the mean first passage time to a fixed target. Here we consider the more realistic problem of a target positioned at a random distance $R$ from the resetting site, selected from a given target distribution $P_T(R)$. We introduce the notion of a conjugate target distribution to a given waiting time distribution. The conjugate target distribution, $P_T^*(R)$, is that $P_T(R)$ for which $\psi(t)$ extremizes the mean time to locate the target. In the case of diffusion we derive an explicit expression for $P^*_T(R)$ conjugate to a given $\psi(t)$ which holds in arbitrary spatial dimension. Our results show that stochastic resetting prevails over sharp restart for target distributions with exponential or heavier tails.</p>

We distinguish successively (i) the open questions arising in the few-body problem with Wigner-Bethe-Peierls contact interactions - essentially the stability of the gas with respect to the Efimov effect and the calculation of the cluster (or virial) coefficients, (ii) those arising in the effective low-energy theory of Landau and Khalatnikov quantum hydrodynamics - essentially the damping of phonon modes and the coherence time of the condensate of pairs, and finally (iii) questions requiring a complete, microscopic solution of the many-body problem, such as the specific properties of the acoustic excitation branch (Goldstone) of the condensate of pairs, or its collective excitation branch (Higgs) in the broken-pair continuum.</p>

            <h2>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Juan C. Petit, Saswati Ganguly, Matthias Sperl</p>
            <p>We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same distance from jamming density, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</p>

            <p>The fate of the Fermi surface in bulk electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ remains elusive, as does the origin and extension of its pseudogap phase. Here, we use high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the electronic structure of Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$IrO$_{4}$ up to $x=0.2$, a factor of two higher than in previous work. We find that the antinodal pseudogap persists up to the highest doping level, and thus beyond the sharp increase in Hall carrier density to $\simeq 1+x$ recently observed above $x^{*}=0.16$ [Y.-T. Hsu et al., Nature Physics 20, 1593 (2024)]. This suggests that doped iridates host a unique phase of matter in which a large Hall density coexists with an anisotropic pseudogap, breaking up the Fermi surface into disconnected arcs. The temperature boundary of the pseudogap is $T^{*}\simeq 200$ K for $x=0.2$, comparable to cuprates and to the energy scale of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in cuprates and iridates.</p>

            <p>We report on the experimental observation of classical Brownian motion in momentum space by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of Rubidium atoms prepared in a hexagonal optical lattice. Upon suddenly increasing the effective atomic mass, the BEC as a whole behaves as a classical rigid body with its center-of-mass receiving random momentum kicks by a Langevin force arising from atom loss and interactions with the surrounding thermal cloud. Physically, this amounts to selective heating of the BEC center-of-mass degree of freedom by a sudden quench, while with regard to the relative coordinates, the BEC is stablized by repulsive atomic interactions, and its internal dynamics is suppressed by forced evaporative cooling induced by atom loss. A phenomenological theory is developed that well explains the experimental data quantitatively.</p>

            <h2>Heat Transport in Ionic Liquids</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cillian Cockrell, Aleksandra Dragović</p>
            <p>Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the competing effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat capacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This issue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of liquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly important role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport processes. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat transport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of their mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid within the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities which implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial mass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by partial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the heat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with increasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with temperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases monotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom afforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and anions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent but diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this condition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this coherent collective motion to the ``diffusive" phonons that have been used to explain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.</p>

            <h2>Exponential suppression of the topological gap in self-consistent intrinsic Majorana nanowires</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francisco Lobo, Elsa Prada, Pablo San-Jose</p>
            <p>Predictions of topological p-wave superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have been difficult to realize experimentally. Consequently, researchers are actively exploring alternative platforms for MZMs. In this work, we theoretically study depleted nanowires with intrinsic superconductivity (as opposed to proximity-induced). Using a self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field theory, we compute the topological phase diagram versus Zeeman field and filling for intrinsic wires with attractive interactions. We find that, although intrinsic wires could be less vulnerable than hybrids to topology-adverse effects, such as disorder and metallization, they are hindered by a fundamental limitation of their own. Although a topological p-wave gap is indeed possible, it is far less robust than in hybrid Majorana nanowires. Instead of remaining stable beyond the topological transition, it is found to decay exponentially with Zeema field, greatly reducing the parameter region with an appreciable topological gap.</p>

            <h2>Trypanosoma brucei moving in microchannels and through constrictions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zihan Tan, Julian I. U. Peters, Holger Stark</p>
            <p>Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.</p>

This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhi Yan, Xujin Zhang, Jianhua Xiao, Cheng Fang, Xiaohong Xu</p>
            <p>Ferroelectric polarization switching in electrically controlled van der Waals multiferroic tunnel junctions (vdW-MFTJs) causes atomic migration, compromising device stability and fatigue resistance. Here we propose a fully magnetically controlled vdW-MFTJ based on a \(\mathrm{CrBr_3/MnPSe_3/CrBr_3}\) vertical heterostructure, which achieves ferroelectric polarization reversal without relying on atomic migration driven by inversion symmetry breaking. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the spin-polarized quantum transport properties of the proposed structure. By integrating asymmetric PtTe$_2$/alkali-metal (Li/Na/K)-doped/intercalated CrBr$_3$ electrodes, the device demonstrates exceptional performance, with a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) exceeding $8.1\times10^5$\% and tunneling electroresistance (TER) reaching 2499\%, while the spin-filtering channels can be flexibly controlled by the magnetization direction of the magnetic free layer, achieving perfect spin-filtering over a broad bias voltage range. Applying an external bias voltage further enhances these metrics, increasing TMR to $3.6\times 10^7$\% and TER to 9990\%. Notably, a pronounced negative differential resistance (NDR) effect is observed, yielding an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (PVR) of $9.55\times10^9$\%, representing the highest value reported for vertical tunnel junctions. These extraordinary characteristics highlight the potential of vdW-MFTJs for ultra-efficient electronic switching, a key feature for next-generation spintronic devices. Our findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for designing and developing high-performance magnetic storage and logic technologies.</p>

            <h2>Simulations of Three-dimensional Nematic Guidance of Microswimmers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zeyang Mou, Yuan Li, Zhihong You, Rui Zhang</p>
            <p>It has been shown that an anisotropic liquid crystalline (LC) environment can be used to guide the self-propulsion dynamics of dispersed microswimmers, such as bacteria. This type of composite system is named "living nematic" (LN). In the dilute limit, bacteria are found to mainly follow the local director field. Beyond the dilute limit, however, they exhibit novel dynamical behaviors, from swirling around a spiral +1 defect pattern to forming undulating waves, and to active turbulence. Our current knowledge of how these different behaviors emerge at different population densities remains limited. Here we develop a hybrid method to simulate the dynamics of microswimmers dispersed in a nematic LC. Specifically, we model the microswimmers using active Brownian dynamics method, which is coupled to a hydrodynamic model of nematic LCs to describe the evolution of the flow field and the LC structure. Our method is validated by comparing to existing quasi-two-dimensional (2D) experiments, including undulated swirling around a spiral pattern and stabilized undulated jets on a periodic C-pattern. We further extend our method to three-dimensional (3D) systems by examining loop-defect dynamics. We find that the morphodynamics and destiny of a loop defect not only depend on the activity (self-propulsion velocity), effective size, and the initial distribution of the swimmers, but also rely on its winding profile. Specifically, +1/2 wedge and radial twist winding can dictate the dynamics of loop defects. By varying the characteristic reversal time, we predict that microswimmers not necessarily accumulate in splay regions. Taken together, our hybrid method provides a faithful tool to explain and guide the experiments of LNs in both 2D and 3D, sheds light on the interplay between microswimmer distribution and defect dynamics, and unravels the design principles of using LCs to control active matter.</p>

            <h2>Orientation-dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenjun Zhao, Yuri Fukaya, Pablo Burset, Jorge Cayao, Yukio Tanaka, Bo Lu</p>
            <p>We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</p>

            <p>Here we demonstrate the floating zone crystal growth of the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Historically, the growth of iridates from a ternary melt has been precluded by the extreme vapor pressure of the metal oxide species and the difficulty of maintaining the correct oxidation state of Ir at high temperatures. Here, we show that the application of a high-pressure oxygen growth environment stabilizes the Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ phase, leading to the first demonstration of cm$^{3}$-scale crystals. In contrast to the conventional SrCl$_2$ flux growth method, where poor control over disorder leads to strong sample dependence, the high-pressure floating zone growth enables active control over the homogeneity of the melt. Crystals grown via this technique possess qualitatively similar properties to those grown via flux, with a relatively sharp onset of antiferromagnetic order observed in temperature-dependent magnetization. Further, we demonstrate that by tuning the mixing rate of the melt, we are able to grow natively hole-doped Sr$_2$Ir$_{1-y}$O$_4$, which exhibits a strongly modified magnetic and electronic response.</p>

            <h2>Ancilla theory of twisted bilayer graphene I: topological Mott localization and pseudogap metal in twisted bilayer graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Boran Zhou, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>The recent experimental studies of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) raise a fundamental question: how do we understand Mott localization in a topological band? In this work, we offer a new perspective of Mott physics, which can be generalized to TBG directly in momentum space. In our theory, the Mott gap is understood as from an exciton-like hybridization $\Phi(\mathbf k) c^\dagger(\mathbf k)\psi(\mathbf k)$ between the physical electron $c$ and an ancilla fermion $\psi$. In the conventional Mott insulator of trivial band, the hybridization is $s$-wave with $\Phi(\mathbf k)=\frac{U}{2}$, where $U$ is the on-site Hubbard interaction. On the other hand, the band topology in TBG enforces a topological Mott hybridization with $\Phi(\mathbf k)\sim k_x \pm i k_y$ in a small region around $\mathbf{k}=0$. We dub this new Mott state as topological Mott localization because of the $p\pm ip$ order parameter analogous to the topological superconductor. At $\nu=0$, we find a topological Mott semimetal with a low energy effective theory resembling that of the untwisted bilayer graphene. For $\nu=\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we show transitions from correlated insulators to Mott semimetals at smaller $U$. In the most intriguing density region $\nu=-2-x$, we propose a symmetric pseudogap metal at small $x$, which hosts a small Fermi surface and violates the perturbative Luttinger theorem. Interestingly, the quasiparticle is primarily formed by ancilla fermion, which we interpret as a composite fermion formed by a hole bound to a particle-hole pair. Our theory offers a unified language to describe the Mott localization in both trivial and topological bands in momentum space, and we anticipate applications in other moiré systems with topological Wannier obstruction, such as the twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayer.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic excitations and electronic properties of fully quantum double-exchange ferromagnets, i.e., systems where ferromagnetic ordering emerges from the competition between spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom, but without the canonical approximation of using classical localized spins. Specifically, we investigate spin excitations within the Kondo lattice-like model, as well as a two-orbital Hubbard Hamiltonian in proximity to the orbital-selective Mott phase. Computational analysis of the magnon dispersion, damping, and spectral weight within these models reveals unexpected phenomena, such as magnon mode softening and the anomalous decoherence of magnetic excitations as observed in earlier experimental efforts, but explained here without the use of the phononic degrees of freedom. We show that these effects are intrinsically linked to incoherent spectral features near the Fermi level, which arise due to the quantum nature of the local (on-site) triplets. This incoherent spectrum leads to a Stoner-like continuum on which spin excitations scatter, governing magnon lifetime and strongly influencing the dynamical spin structure factor. Our study explores the transition from coherent to incoherent magnon spectra by varying the electron density. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the localized spin mitigates decoherence by suppressing the incoherent spectral contributions near the Fermi level. We also discuss the effective $J_1$-$J_2$ spin Hamiltonian, which can accurately describe the large doping region characterized by the magnon-mode softening. Finally, we show that this behavior is also present in multiorbital models with partially filled orbitals, namely, in systems without localized spin moments, provided that the model is in a strong coupling regime.</p>

            <h2>Identifying Instabilities with Quantum Geometry in Flat Band Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia-Xin Zhang, Wen O. Wang, Leon Balents, Lucile Savary</p>
            <p>The absence of a well-defined Fermi surface in flat-band systems challenges the conventional understanding of instabilities toward Landau order based on nesting. We investigate the existence of an intrinsic nesting structure encoded in the band geometry (i.e. the wavefunctions of the flat band(s)), which leads to a maximal susceptibility at the mean-field level and thus determines the instability towards ordered phases. More generally, we show that for a given band structure and observable, we can define two vector fields: one which corresponds to the Bloch vector of the projection operator onto the manifold of flat bands, and another which is "dressed" by the observable. The overlap between the two vector fields, possibly shifted by a momentum vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$, fully determines the mean field susceptibility of the corresponding order parameter. When the overlap is maximized, so is the susceptibility, and this geometrically corresponds to "perfect nesting" of the band structure. In that case, we show that the correlation length of this order parameter, even for $\boldsymbol{Q}\neq \boldsymbol{0}$, is entirely characterized by a generalized quantum metric in an intuitive manner, and is therefore lower-bounded in topologically non-trivial bands. As an example, we demonstrate hidden nesting for staggered antiferromagnetic spin order in an exactly flat-band model, which is notably different from the general intuition that flat bands are closely associated with ferromagnetism. We check the actual emergence of this long-range order using the determinantal quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like state (pairing with non-zero center of mass momentum) can arise in flat bands upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, even if Zeeman splitting is absent.</p>

            <p>The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new avenues for exploring topological spin textures and their applications in next-generation spintronics. Among these materials, Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) emerges as a model system due to its room-temperature skyrmion phases, which are stabilized by strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the atomistic origins of DMI in centrosymmetric vdW lattices remain elusive. Here, we report a spontaneous DMI enhancement mechanism driven by FC in FGaT and its analog Fe3GeTe2 (FGeT). Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have observed the irreversible precipitation of FeTe2 in annealed FGaT. The resulting FeTe2/FGaT heterostructure is considered to break the symmetry and significantly enhance the DMI. Furthermore, similar phenomenon has been observed in the family ferromagnetic material FGeT as well. Additionally, the precipitation of FeTe2 varies significantly with different thicknesses of FGaT, aligning closely with the reported behavior of skyrmions. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms behind the origin of the DMI in ternary tellurides, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of OH- ions incorporation on the lattice strain and spontaneous polarization of BaTiO3 nanorods synthesized under different conditions. It was confirmed that the lattice strain depends directly on Ba supersaturation, with higher supersaturation leading to an increase in the lattice strain. However, it was shown that crystal growth and observed lattice distortion are not primarily influenced by external strain; rather, OH- ions incorporation plays a key role in generating internal chemical strains and driving these processes. By using the less reactive TiO2 precursor instead of TiOCl2 and controlling Ba supersaturation, the slower nucleation rate enables more effective regulation of OH- ions incorporation and crystal growth. This in turn effects both particle size and lattice distortion, leading to c/a ratio of 1.013 - 1.014. The incorporation of OH- ions induces lattice elongation along the c-axis, contributing to anisotropic growth, increasing of the rod diameter and their growth-induced bending. However, the possibility of the curvature-induced changes in domain morphology of BaTiO3 nanorods remains almost unexplored. To study the possibility, we perform analytical calculations and finite element modeling, which provide insights into the curvature-induced changes in the strain-gradient, polarization distribution, and domain morphology in BaTiO3 nanorods. Theoretical results reveal the appearance of the domain stripes in BaTiO3 nanorod when the curvature exceeds a critical angle. The physical origin of the domain stripes emergence is the tendency to minimize its elastic energy of the nanorod by the domain splitting. These findings suggest that BaTiO3 nanorods, with curvature-controllable amount of domain stripes, could serve as flexible race-track memory elements for flexo-tronics and domain-wall electronics.</p>

            <h2>Hall effects in Carroll dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> L.Marsot, P.-M. Zhang, M. Chernodub, P.A. Horvathy</p>
            <p>``Do Carroll particles move?'' The answer depends on the characteristics of the particle such as its mass, spin, electric charge, and magnetic moment. A massive Carroll particle (closely related to fractons) does not move; its immobility follows from Carroll boost symmetry which implies dipole conservation, but not conversely. A massless Carroll particle may propagate by following the Hall law, consistently with the partial breaking of the Carroll boost symmetry. The framework is extended to Carroll field theory. In $d=2$ space dimensions, the Carroll group has a two-fold central extension which allows us to generalize the dynamics to massive and massless particles, including anyons. The anyonic spin and magnetic moment combine with the doubly-extended structure parameterized by two Casimir invariants interpreted as intrinsic magnetization and non-commutativity parameter. The extended Carroll particle subjected to an electromagnetic background field moves following a generalized Hall law which includes a Zeeman force. This theory is illustrated by massless, uncharged anyons with doubly-centrally extended structure we call exotic photons, which move on the horizon of a Black Hole, giving rise to an anyonic spin-Hall Effect.</p>

            <h2>Generalized $α$-Observational Entropy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shivam Sinha, Nripendra Majumbdar, S. Aravinda</p>
            <p>Traditional measures of entropy, like the Von Neumann entropy, while fundamental in quantum information theory, are insufficient when interpreted as thermodynamic entropy due to their invariance under unitary transformations, which contradicts observed entropy increases in isolated systems. Recognizing this limitations of existing measures for thermodynamic entropy, recent research has focused on observational entropy (OE) as a promising alternative, offering practical applicability and theoretical insights. In this work, we extend the scope of observational entropy by generalizing it to a parameterized version called $\alpha$-Observational entropy ($\alpha$-OE). $\alpha$-OE is expressed in terms of the Petz-Rényi relative entropy between the states on which a quantum-to-classical channel is applied. The $\alpha$-OE reduces to OE under $\alpha\rightarrow 1$. We prove various properties of the $\alpha$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $\alpha$-OE as a function of refinement of coarse-graining. We further explore the role of $\alpha$-OE in thermodynamic contexts, particularly for the entropy production in open and closed quantum systems and its relation with the Helmholtz free energy.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jaeyong Bae, Hawoong Jeong</p>
            <p>Bridging the gap between the practical performance of deep learning and its theoretical foundations often involves analyzing neural networks through stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Expanding on previous research that focused on modeling structured inputs under a simple Gaussian setting, we analyze the behavior of a deep learning system trained on inputs modeled as Gaussian mixtures to better simulate more general structured inputs. Through empirical analysis and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that under certain standardization schemes, the deep learning model converges toward Gaussian setting behavior, even when the input data follow more complex or real-world distributions. This finding exhibits a form of universality in which diverse structured distributions yield results consistent with Gaussian assumptions, which can support the theoretical understanding of deep learning models.</p>

In the microwave band ($\mathrm{\sim}$1$\unicode{x2013}$10 GHz) the cryogenic and low-power dielectric loss is dominated by two-level systems. However, the origin of the loss in the millimeter-submillimeter band ($\mathrm{\sim}$0.1$\unicode{x2013}$1 THz) is not understood. We measured the loss of hydrogenated amorphous SiC (a-SiC:H) films in the 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz range using superconducting microstrip resonators and Fourier-transform spectroscopy. The agreement between the loss data and a Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude dispersion model suggests that vibrational modes above 10 THz dominate the loss in the a-SiC:H above 200 GHz.</p>

            <p>Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roberto Ruiz, Alejandro Sopena, Esperanza López, Germán Sierra, Balázs Pozsgay</p>
            <p>The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superposition of plane waves that is characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</p>

            <h2>Evaluating many-body stabilizer Rényi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Ming Ding, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling \emph{reduced Pauli strings} within a \emph{reduced configuration space}, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. We first isolate the free energy part in $2$-SRE, which is a trivial term. Notably, at quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the \emph{characteristic function} contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, analyzing the volume-law correction to SRE reveals a discontinuity tied to criticalities, suggesting that it is more informative than the full-state magic. For conformal critical points, we claim it could reflect nonlocal magic residing in correlations. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.</p>

            <p>Topological Floquet energy pumps -- which use periodic driving to create a topologically protected quantized energy current -- have been proposed and studied theoretically, but have never been observed directly. Previous work proposed that such a pump could be realized with a strongly-driven superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed hierarchy of energy scales and drive frequencies can be realized using a transmon qubit. We develop an experimental toolkit to realize the adiabatic driving field required for energy pumping using coordinated frequency modulation of the transmon and amplitude modulation of an applied resonant microwave drive. With this toolkit, we measure adiabatic evolution of the qubit under the applied field for times comparable to $T_1$, which far exceed the bare qubit dephasing time. This result paves the way for direct experimental observation of topological energy pumping.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Oskar Leimkuhler, K. Birgitta Whaley</p>
            <p>We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and generalized unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations, for which computing the off-diagonal matrix elements is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete for any polynomial depth. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.</p>

            <h2>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G.E. Volovik</p>
            <p>In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</p>

The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of $19.786$mm, a finesse of $2.35\times 10^4$ and operates $214\mu\text{m}$ away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</p>

Linearly polarized condensates exhibit a combined effect of polariton bunching and two-polariton interference. Under elliptically polarized excitation, the temporal evolution of the spinor condensate results in the revival of the HOM-dip at the spinor Larmor precession frequency.</p>

            <p>We analyze the universality classes of phase transitions in a variety of nonlinear voter models. By mapping several models with symmetric absorbing states onto a canonical model introduced in previous studies, we confirm that they exhibit a Generalized Voter (GV) transition. We then propose a canonical mean-field model that extends the original formulation by incorporating a noise term that eliminates the absorbing states. This generalization gives rise to a phase diagram featuring two distinct types of phase transitions: a continuous Ising transition and a discontinuous transition we call Modified Generalized Voter (MGV). These two transition lines converge at a tricritical point. We map diverse noisy nonlinear voter models onto this extended canonical form. Using finite-size scaling techniques above and below the upper critical dimension, we show that the continuous transition of these models belongs to the Ising universality class in their respective dimensionality. We also find universal behavior at the tricitical point. Our results provide a unifying framework for classifying phase transitions in stochastic models of opinion dynamics with both nonlinearity and noise.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani</p>
            <p>Recent experiments on geometrically frustrated kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) have revealed the emergence of the charge loop current (cLC) order near the bond order (BO) phase. However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals.</p>

            <p>We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Recently we developed a local and constructive algorithm based on Lie algebraic methods for compressing Trotterized evolution under Hamiltonians that can be mapped to free fermions. The compression algorithm yields a circuit which scales linearly in the number of qubits, has a depth independent of evolution time and compresses time-dependent Hamiltonians. The algorithm is limited to simple nearest-neighbor spin interactions and fermionic hopping. In this work, we extend our methods to compress evolution with long-range fermionic hopping, thereby enabling the embedding of arbitrary lattices onto a chain of qubits for fermion models. Moreover, we show that controlled time evolution, as well as fermion creation and annihilation operators can also be compressed. We demonstrate our results by adiabatically preparing the ground state for a half-filled fermionic chain, simulating a $4 \times 4$ tight binding model on ibmq washington, and calculating the topological Zak phase on a Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. With these new developments, our results enable the simulation of a wider range of models of interest and the efficient compression of subcircuits.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Patrick BarAvi</p>
            <p>The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central challenge in statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are limited to dilute gases and short timescales. We introduce Folded State Dynamics (FSD), a framework in which irreversibility arises from the geometric structure of phase space in systems with coupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to conventional models with unfolded, weakly coupled modes, FSD exhibits phase space folding, where deterministic coupling induces instability and chaotic mixing. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible phase space volume, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) occupy measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times Trec, resolving Loschmidt's and Zermelo's objections without coarse-graining or fine-tuning. FSD is further extended to include charged systems (cFSD), where electromagnetic interactions continuously drive phase space folding. FSD thus offers a deterministic and testable mechanism for irreversibility, with implications ranging from confined colloids to the cosmological arrow of time</p>

            <p>The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field, and has later been generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this remarkable phenomenon to the energetic separation of substantial but non-quantized Berry fluxes within the topologically trivial bands. Adding a random disorder potential then nudges the system into a stable quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime of the clean system obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window in either of the trivial bands. Our results are corroborated by extensive numerical transport simulations as well as the analysis of several complementary topological markers.</p>

            <p>Optically anisotropic materials are sought after for tailoring the polarization of light. Recently, colossal optical anisotropy was reported in a quasi-one-dimensional chalcogenide, Sr1.125TiS3. Compared to SrTiS3, the excess Sr in Sr1.125TiS3 leads to periodic structural modulations and introduces additional electrons that undergo charge ordering on select Ti atoms to form a highly polarizable cloud oriented along the c-axis, hence, resulting in the colossolal optical anisotropy. Here, further enhancement of the colossal optical anisotropy to 2.5 in Sr1.143TiS3 is reported through control over the periodicity of the atomic-scale modulations. The role of structural modulations in tuning the optical properties in a series of SrxTiS3 compounds has been investigated using DFT calculations. The structural modulations arise from various stacking sequences of face-sharing TiS6 octahedra and twist-distorted trigonal prisms, and are found to be thermodynamically stable for x larger than 1 but smaller than 1.5. As x increases, an indirect-to-direct band gap transition is predicted for x equal to and larger than 1.143 along with an increased occupancy of Ti-dz2 states. Together, these two factors result in a theoretically predicted maximum birefriengence of 2.5 for Sr1.143TiS3. Single crystals of Sr1.143TiS3 were grown using a molten-salt flux method. Atomic-scale observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm the feasibility of synthesizing SrxTiS3 with varied modulation periodicities. Overall, these findings demonstrate compositonal tunability of optical properties in SrxTiS3 compounds, and potentially in other hexagonal perovskites having structural modulations.</p>

            <p>Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Strain-induced gyrotropic effects in ferroelectric BaTiS3</h2>

            <p>Gyrotropic effects, including natural optical activity (NOA) and the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE), are crucial for advancing optical and transport devices. We explore these effects in the BaTiS3 system, a quasi-one-dimensional crystal that exhibits giant optical anisotropy. (Niu et al. Nat. Photonics 12, 392 (2018); Zhao et al. Chem. Mater. 34, 5680 (2022)). In the P63cm phase which is stable under room temperature, we predict two distinct strain-induced phase transitions: a symmetry-lowering transition from the P63cm to P63 phase under tensile strain, which enhances NOA and enables optical rotation; and an isostructural insulator-to-polar Weyl semimetal (WSM) transition under compressive strain, which activates the NAHE and exhibits a strain-induced sign reversal. The low-temperature P21 phase also transforms into a P212121 phase under enough compressive strains with such phase transition exhibiting a large NOA. All these results highlight BaTiS3 as a viable candidate for novel ferroelectrics, optical and transport devices with strain enhanced or activated gyrotropic properties.</p>

            <p>Optically active quantum dot molecules (QDMs) can host multi-spin quantum states with the potential for the deterministic generation of photonic graph states with tailored entanglement structures. Their usefulness for the generation of such non-classical states of light is determined by orbital and spin decoherence mechanisms, particularly phonon-mediated processes dominant at energy scales up to a few millielectronvolts. Here, we directly measure the spectral function of orbital phonon relaxation in a QDM and benchmark our findings against microscopic kp theory. Our results reveal phonon-mediated relaxation rates exhibiting pronounced resonances and anti-resonances, with rates ranging from several ten ns$^{-1}$ to tens of $\mu$s$^{-1}$. Comparison with a kinetic model reveals the voltage (energy) dependent phonon coupling strength and fully explains the interplay between phonon-assisted relaxation and radiative recombination. These anti-resonances can be leveraged to increase the lifetime of energetically unfavorable charge configurations needed for realizing efficient spin-photon interfaces and multi-dimensional cluster states.</p>

            <h2>Cavity-Mediated Electron-Electron Interactions: Renormalizing Dirac States in Graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hang Liu, Francesco Troisi, Hannes Hübener, Simone Latini, Angel Rubio</p>
            <p>Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as a strategy for tuning material properties. Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting with quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and predicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons and cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach to investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity photon modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum nature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands. In contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized light field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions induced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation of flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two symmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal interactions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent photon modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for the simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel cavity-induced quantum phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Chiral near-field control of quantum light generation using magneto-optical graphene</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mikkel Have Eriksen, Joel D. Cox</p>
            <p>We theoretically explore strategies to actively control photon emission from quantum light sources by leveraging the large magneto-optical response of graphene. The quantum electrodynamic response of graphene -- characterized by the Purcell factor and the Lamb shift of a proximal emitter -- is analyzed for extended two-dimensional sheets, one-dimensional nanoribbons, and zero-dimensional nanodisks, all of which are endowed with an intrinsic chiral near-field response under a static perpendicular magnetic field. Using rigorous semianalytical models of these systems, we reveal that the emission properties can be readily tuned by variations in doping charge carrier density and applied magnetic field strength, both with respect to magnetoplasmon resonances (at infrared frequencies) and Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations (entering telecommunication bands) associated with optical transitions between discrete Landau levels. Localized magnetoplasmons in graphene nanoribbons are predicted to induce large dissymmetry in the spontaneous emission from left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized transitions in a proximal quantum emitter, presenting applications for chiral quantum optical waveguiding. This chiral dissymmetry is further enhanced in gyrotropic graphene nanodisks, signaling that the spatial shaping of near-fields in nanostructured graphene can significantly boost the intrinsic chiral response induced by the magnetic field. These results indicate that magneto-optical graphene constitutes a versatile and highly tunable platform for quantum light generation and manipulation at the nanoscale.</p>

            <p>Exploring the relations between coexisting, cooperative, or competing types of ordering is a key to identify and harness the mechanisms governing the mutual interactions between them, and to utilize their combined properties. We have experimentally explored the response of the charge density wave (CDW) to various antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic, and field-aligned ferromagnetic states that constitute the magnetic phase diagram of TmNiC$_2$. The high resolution x-ray diffraction experiment employing synchrotron radiation at low temperature and high magnetic field, allowed to follow the superstructure satellite reflections, being a sensitive probe of CDW. This investigation not only reveals direct evidence that the charge density wave avoids even a partial suppression in the antiferromagnetic ground state but also proves that this state coexists, without any visible signatures of weakening, in the entire dome of the magnetically ordered phases, including the field-aligned ferromagnetic state. The calculations of the electronic and phonon structures support the experiment, revealing that the dominant contribution to the CDW transition stems from momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling. We conclude that this mechanism prevents the CDW from vanishing, although the nesting conditions within the magnetically ordered phases deteriorate.</p>

            <p>Strongly correlated and topological phases in moiré materials are exquisitely sensitive to lattice geometry at both atomic and superlattice length scales. Twist angle, pressure, and strain directly modify the lattice, and thus act as highly effective tuning parameters. Here we examine electrical transport in twisted bilayer graphene subjected to continuous uniaxial strain. Near the magic angle ($\approx 1.1^{\circ}$), devices exhibit a pronounced elastoresistance that depends on band filling and temperature, with a gauge factor more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional metals. In selected doping regimes the elastoresistance exhibits a Curie-Weiss-like temperature divergence. We discuss possible microscopic origins, including nematic fluctuations and enhanced electronic entropy from fluctuating isospin moments. Our work establishes uniaxial strain as a versatile probe of correlated physics in a moiré material.</p>

            <h2>Topological photonics of generalized and nonlinear eigenvalue equations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takuma Isobe, Tsuneya Yoshida, Yasuhiro Hatsugai</p>
            <p>Topological photonics is developed based on the analogy of Schrödinger equation which is mathematically reduced to a standard eigenvalue equation. Notably, several photonic systems are beyond the standard topological band theory as they are described by generalized or nonlinear eigenvalue equations. In this article, we review the topological band theory of this category. In the first part, we discuss topological photonics of generalized eigenvalue equations where the band structure may take complex values even when the involved matrices are Hermitian. These complex bands explain the characteristic dispersion relation of hyperbolic metamaterials. In addition, our numerical analysis predicts the emergence of symmetry-protected exceptional points in a photonic crystal composed of negative index media. In the second part, by introducing auxiliary bands, we establish the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence under ``weak" nonlinearity of eigenvalues. The nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence elucidates the robustness of chiral edge modes in photonic systems where the permittivity and permeability are frequency dependent.</p>

            <p>Exploration of nontrivial superconductivity and electronic band topology is at the core of condensed matter physics and applications to quantum information. The transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoTe$_2$ has been proposed as an ideal candidate to explore the interplay between topology and superconductivity, but their studies remain limited regarding the required high-pressure environments. Here, we observe proximity-induced surface $p$-wave superconductivity, and investigate the higher-order topological nature of MoTe$_2$ in its 1T$'$ phase, which emerges from the T$_d$ phase through a high-pressure-induced topological phase transition. Using surface-sensitive soft-point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy, we confirm the emergence of surface $s+p$-wave superconductivity via the BTK model as well as a zero-bias conductance peak. Such surface $p$-wave superconductivity emerges via the proximity effect between an $s$-wave superconducting band and a second-order topological band, which is protected by the time-reversal and inversion symmetries. The temperature dependence of the surface $p$-wave superconducting gap shows a correlation with that of the bulk $s$-wave gap, as well as its suppression by an external magnetic field or a reduction in pressure, implying its proximity-induced origin. Moreover, we suggest that the topological hinge states, derived from second-order topological bands, evolve into zero-energy Majorana corner states in this proximity-effect-induced third-order topological superconducting phase. These results demonstrate the potential realization of topological superconductivity in MoTe$_2$, thus opening a pathway for studying various topological natures of TMDC materials.</p>

In strong contrast to synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray PEEM as a leading method for element-specific magnetic properties via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), laboratory ultraviolet (UV) PEEM has seen limited application with much smaller dichroism effects for in-plane magnetization. Here we introduce darkfield PEEM as a novel approach to enhance MCD contrast in threshold photoemission, enabling efficient MCD imaging with significantly enhanced contrast by an order-of-magnitude for Fe(001). This advancement paves the way for MCD imaging on femtosecond timescales using modern lasers. The experimental results will be quantitatively benchmarked against advanced relativistic photoemission calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jeong Hyeok Cha, Hyun-Yong Lee, Heung-Sik Kim</p>
            <p>Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton O. Pokusinskyi, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy</p>
            <p>Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</p>

            <p>Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.</p>

            <p>Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). They consist of artificial spins that evolve towards a low-energy configuration representing a problem's solution. Most realistic COPs require both spin-spin couplings and external fields. In IMs with analog spins, these interactions scale differently with the continuous spin amplitudes, leading to imbalances that affect performance. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but their performance has not been benchmarked. We address this gap through a numerical analysis. We evaluate the time-to-solution of these methods across three distinct problem classes with up to 500 spins. Our results show that the most effective way to incorporate external fields is through an approach where the spin interactions are proportional to the spin signs, rather than their continuous amplitudes.</p>

            <p>Motivated by experiments carried out in the near infrared using zero-loop-area Sagnac interferometers, we explore electromagnetic signatures of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) at microwave frequencies, using as a prototypical example a semiclassical conductor in a magnetic field. TRSB is generically accompanied by a skew-symmetric term in the electrodynamic response tensors (permittivity, conductivity, surface impedance), imparting a nonreciprocal phase shift to left- and right-circularly polarized electromagnetic waves reflected from the surface of such a material. We show that TRSB manifests as a difference in the surface reactance experienced by circularly polarized waves, and can be detected using a doubly degenerate resonator mode, such as the TE$_{111}$ mode of a cylindrical cavity. In addition to the frequency splitting induced by TRSB we show that, when interrogated by circularly polarized microwaves, the forward and reverse transmission responses of such a resonator break reciprocity, providing a crucial signature that distinguishes true Faraday effects (i.e., circular birefringence) from non-TRSB effects such as linear birefringence. In the limit that the sample is larger than the spot size (i.e., larger than the diameter of the microwave cavity) we show that the TRSB resonator has sensitivity to polar Kerr angle comparable to that of the zero-loop-area Sagnac, and should provide complementary insights into unconventional superconductors such as UPt$_3$ and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ that have been observed to spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry.</p>

            <p>The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as monolayer WSe$_2$ is dominated by excitons. Enhanced interactions result in the formation of many-body excitonic complexes, which provide a testing ground for excitons and quantum many-body theories. In particular, correlated many-body excitonic complexes could constitute a limiting case that puts competing exciton descriptions to the test. Here, we report a hitherto unobserved many-body excitonic complex that emerges upon electrostatically doping both the $K$ and $Q$ valleys with charge carriers. We optically probe the WSe$_2$ exciton landscape using charge-tunable devices with unusually thin gate dielectrics that facilitate doping up to several $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this previously unexplored regime, we observe the emergence of the thermodynamically stable state in the presence of as many as 10 filled valleys. We gain insight into the physics of this complex using magneto-optical measurements. Our results are well-described by a model where the behavior of the formed exciton complex depends on the number of distinguishable Fermi seas with which the photoexcited electron-hole pair interacts. In addition to expanding the repertoire of excitons in 2D semiconductors, the extremal nature of this complex could probe the limit of exciton models and could help answer open questions about the screened Coulomb interaction in low-dimensional semiconductors.</p>

The main focus of our paper is to understand how the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ evolve as the system enters the non-Fermi liquid regime. We obtain the full scaling function for the electron polarization bubble at arbitrary $l$, which interpolates between the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. We show that collective excitations for all $l$ remain stable and causal throughout the crossover and right at the quantum critical point.</p>

            <p>Sliding ferroelectricity is highly attractive for its low energy barriers and fatigue resistance. As the origin of these exotic properties, its unconventional switching dynamics remains poorly understood: how an electric field drives a perpendicular sliding? Taking $h$-BN bilayer as a model system, its switching dynamics is studied using \textit{ab initio} calculations. The off-diagonal Born effective charge leads to the perpendicular relationship between the electric field and ionic movements. Interestingly, the rules of intrinsic coercive field are distinct between $h$-BN bilayer and conventional ferroelectrics. For $h$-BN bilayer, any perturbation breaking the in-plane symmetry plays a key role to assist the avalanche-like switching dynamics. Moreover, the exotic large off-diagonal Born effective charge near the $P=0$ intermediate state results in a wriggling motion of domain walls in $h$-BN bilayer. Our results reveal the key factors in the ferroelectric switching of sliding ferroelectrics at room temperature.</p>

In a rhombohedral-stacked graphene $N$-layer, the Dirac points at $K_{\pm}$ become $N^\text{th}$-order zeros of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian. When an extra layer of Haldane model is stacked on top of the multilayer, the high-order Dirac points are gapped out and the heterostructure enters QAH phases with $|C|=N+1$.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Buthenhoff, Tobias Holder, Michael M. Scherer</p>
            <p>Non-trivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a non-trivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</p>

We find that the photon number of the ground state is enhanced (suppressed) along the quantum phase transition line when the light-matter coupling is comparable to (much smaller than) the cavity frequency. We also show that the exciton peak in the optical conductivity and photon spectrum that exists without the cavity exhibits the vacuum Rabi splitting at resonance due to the light-matter interaction. This behavior is in contrast to the case without excitons, where the photon spectrum is merely broadened without splitting due to the lack of a sharp resonance.</p>

            <p>Several superconducting phases have been discovered close to a metamagnetic transition in the heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$, unveiling a close relation between its superconducting and magnetic properties. Although suspected to be of magnetic nature, the mechanisms stabilizing these superconducting phases remain mysterious. Here, we present electrical-resistivity measurements on UTe$_2$, with a current $\mathbf{I}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60~T rotating in the ($\mathbf{b}$,$\mathbf{c}$) plane. The Fermi-liquid coefficient $A$ of the electrical resistivity reaches its maximal values at the metamagnetic transition in fields tilted by $30-40~^\circ$ from $\mathbf{b}$ to $\mathbf{c}$, and it becomes asymmetric with higher values above the metamagnetic field than below. The enhancement of $A$ is interpreted as resulting from enhanced magnetic fluctuations, in a regime which coincides with a domain of stabilization of superconductivity beyond $40$~T. These results show that the magnetic fluctuations probed here probably play a key role in stabilizing high-field superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and may provide further insight into the superconducting mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>Imaging domain boundaries of rubrene thin crystallites by photoemission electron microscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moha Naeimi, Katharina Engster, Waqas Pervez, Ingo Barke, Sylvia Speller</p>
            <p>The progress of designing organic semiconductors is extensively dependent on the quality of prepared organic molecular assemblies, since the charge transport mechanism is strongly efficient in highly ordered crystals compared to amorphous domains. Here we present a comprehensive photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) and time-of-flight (TOF) spectroscopic study of rubrene ($\mathrm{C}_{48}\mathrm{H}_{24}$) thin crystals focusing on recently developed orthorhombic crystalline morphologies applied in organic electronic devices. Using femtosecond pulsed lasers with photon energies between 3-6 eV, we explore the interplay between photoemission processes, crystal morphology, and defect states. In a 2-photon photoemission process (2PPE), the PEEM images reveal dominant emission localized at domain boundaries, indicating strong contributions from trap states. In contrast, in 1PPE nm excitation uniform emission across the crystal surface is observed, highlighting a fundamental difference in photoemission mechanisms. Furthermore, in the intermediate photon energy range, we identify a nonlinear, non-integer photon order, where mostly the triclinic morphology contributes to the emission, distinguishing it from the orthorhombic phase. These findings provide a new framework for assessing the quality and internal structure of organic semiconductor thin films via wavelength-dependent photoemission imaging and spectroscopy.</p>

            <h2>A unified bonding entropy model to determine magnetic properties in graphene nanoflakes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chang-Chun He, Jiarui Zeng, Yu-Jun Zhao, Xiao-Bao Yang</p>
            <p>Graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) exhibit rich magnetic behaviors arising from two primary mechanisms: geometry frustration in non-Kekulé structures and electron delocalization-driven aromatic stabilization in Kekulé-type systems. Herein, we develop a unified bonding entropy model (BEM) to quantitatively characterize the magnetic properties in GNFs within a statistical framework, providing an entropy-based criterion for understanding and predicting bond occupancy numbers and unpaired electron distributions. While non-Kekulé systems naturally favor high-spin configurations due to topological frustration, the BEM reveals that even Kekulé-type GNFs can exhibit magnetic character when the entropy gain from unpaired electrons outweighs the loss of aromatic stabilization. The model predictions show excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations in terms of spin density distributions and unpaired electron counts. Our results establish bonding entropy as a general guiding principle for designing carbon-based magentic materials with tunable magnetic properties.</p>

            <h2>The meaning of Li diffusion in cathode materials for the cycling of Li-ion batteries: A case study on LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 thin films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Erwin Hüger, Harald Schmidt</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that for polycrystalline LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 c-axis textured thin film cathodes of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the kinetics of Li storage and release including maximum specific capacity is determined by Li diffusion. The C-rate capability and long-term cycling behavior were investigated. The films exhibited up to 30% of the expected practical capacity even at low C-rates. However, 100% capacity was achieved at very low cycling rates below 0.01C. The capacity showed a reversible behaviour with changing current density, indicating no film degradation. The C-rate capability experiment showed a square root dependence of capacities on current density, which corresponds to a diffusion-controlled process. The estimated diffusivities from the cycling experiments are independent of the current density. The Li chemical and tracer diffusivities were measured using standard electrochemical and non-electrochemical diffusion measurement techniques. Chemical diffusivities, thermodynamic factor, and hence Li tracer diffusivities were determined from potentiostatic intermittent titration (PITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments as a function of electrode potential and state of charge (SOC). The diffusivities were found to be approximately independent of potential, SOC and cycle number. The Li tracer diffusivities were validated by 6Li tracer diffusion experiments with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The diffusivities obtained by PITT and SIMS were found to be more reliable for Li uptake and release than those obtained by EIS. Based on the diffusion results, a C-rate limit for full film delithiation below 0.01 C was calculated due to slow Li diffusion.</p>

            <h2>Spin Nernst and thermal Hall effects of topological triplons in quantum dimer magnets on the maple-leaf and star lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nanse Esaki, Yutaka Akagi, Karlo Penc, Hosho Katsura</p>
            <p>We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the topological properties of triplon excitations in spin-1/2 dimer-singlet ground states defined on the maple leaf and star lattices. Our analysis is based on a model that includes Heisenberg interactions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, and an external magnetic field. In the absence of an in-plane DM vector, we demonstrate that the triplon Hamiltonian maps onto the magnon Hamiltonian of the Kagome lattice, inheriting its nontrivial topological characteristics, including Berry curvature and topological invariants such as the Z2 invariant and Chern numbers. This correspondence enables us to derive analytical expressions for the spin Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities at low temperatures. Furthermore, we explore the effects of realistic finite in-plane DM interactions, uncovering multiple topological transitions and a complex thermal Hall conductivity behavior, including potential sign reversals as functions of magnetic field and temperature. Using layer groups, we also provide a symmetry classification of the star and maple leaf lattices.</p>

            <h2>Using Dopants as Agents to Probe Key Electronic Properties of Organic Semiconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artem Fediai, Franz Symalla, Tobias Neumann, Wolfgang Wenzel</p>
            <p>In organic electronics, conductivity doping is used primarily to eliminate charge injection barriers in organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics and other electronic devices. Therefore, research on conductivity doping is primarily focused on understanding and enhancing the properties of these doped layers. In contrast, this work shifts the focus from optimizing doped layers to leveraging the doping process as a tool for investigating fundamental material properties. Specifically, the dopant is used as an "agent" to enable the measurement of three critical parameters: ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), and Coulomb interaction energy (VC) - that govern dopant ionization and play central roles in organic electronic devices in general. While these parameters can be measured experimentally, conventional approaches often involve intricate or indirect methods, such as spectral deconvolution, which may introduce ambiguities or fail to represent bulk properties. Here it is shown how consolidating the experimental data and simulations on the dopant ionization fraction and doped-induced conductivity can be used to estimate the mean IP or EA of the embedded organic molecule, and VC of the embedded charge-transfer complex. These results illustrate how measuring and simulating doped materials can provide access to the fundamental design parameters of organic electronic devices</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Umut Tanyeri, Ahmed Kallushi, Rıfat Onur Umucalılar, Ahmet Keleş</p>
            <p>Realizing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in ultracold atomic systems remains a major goal despite numerous experimental advances in the last few decades. Recent progress in trap anisotropy control under rapid rotation has renewed interest in ultracold atomic FQH physics, enabling experiments that impart much larger angular momentum per particle and offer in-situ imaging with resolution finer than the cyclotron orbit size. In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation of a rapidly rotating anisotropic Bose gas. By projecting the full Hamiltonian, including both kinetic and interaction terms, onto the lowest Landau level, we derive a compact two-parameter model that captures the effects of interaction strength, rotation rate, and anisotropy. Using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group, we obtain a phase diagram that features broken-symmetry phases and topologically ordered quantum Hall states, while also highlighting the distinctive physics arising from the system's edges. Our results demonstrate the potential for future theoretical and experimental exploration of anisotropic quantum fluids, offering a unified framework for weakly interacting Bose condensates, vortex matter, and strongly correlated topological phases.</p>

            <p>The integration of high-dielectric-constant (high-$\kappa$) materials with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is promising to overcome performance limitations and reach their full theoretical potential. Here we show that naturally occurring phlogopite mica, exfoliated into ultrathin flakes, can serve as a robust high-$\kappa$ dielectric layer for transition metal dichalcogenide-based 2D electronics and optoelectronics. Phlogopite's wide bandgap (~4.8 eV), high dielectric constant (~11), and large breakdown field (10 MVcm$^{-1}$) enable transistors with subthreshold swings down to 100 mVdec$^{-1}$, minimal hysteresis (30-60 mV) and interface trap densities comparable to state-of-the-art oxide dielectrics. Moreover, phototransistors built upon monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) and phlogopite exhibit responsivities up to 3.3x10$^{4}$ AW$^{-1}$ and detectivities near 10$^{10}$ Jones, surpassing devices based on conventional gate insulators. We further demonstrate the versatility of this natural dielectric by integrating phlogopite/MoS$_2$ heterostructures into NMOS inverters, showcasing robust voltage gains and low-voltage operation. Our findings establish phlogopite as a promising, earth-abundant dielectric for next-generation 2D transistor technologies and high-performance photodetection.</p>

            <p>The liquid crystal with suspended ferroelectric nanoparticles is an interesting object for fundamental research of the long-range dipole-dipole interactions; as well as it is promising for optical, optoelectronic and electrochemical applications. Such suspensions can serve as basic elements for advanced nonvolatile memory cells and energy storage devices. The work studies the cells filled with a nematic liquid crystal 5CB and the cells containing 5CB with 0.5 wt.% and 1 wt.% of BaTiO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 24 nm. We analyzed the time dependences of the current flowing through the cells at constant applied voltage and the voltage dynamics in the no-load mode. The time dependences of the current and voltage show a slowing down decay rate. For the cells with BaTiO3 nanoparticles, the decrease in the decay time is characteristic. A possible physical reason for the retarding decay time rate is the indirect effect of screening charges, which cover ferroelectric nanoparticles, and slow ionic transport in the liquid crystal. To explain the dynamics of current and voltage, the finite element modeling of the polarization distribution, domain structure dynamics, and charge state of nanoparticles in a liquid crystal is performed using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach. Theoretical results confirmed the leading role of screening charges, because the surface of a ferroelectric nanoparticle adsorbs an ionic-electronic charge that partially screens its spontaneous polarization in single-domain and/or poly-domain states. When an electric field is applied to the liquid crystal with nanoparticles, it can release part of the screening charge (mainly due to the change in the polarization of the nanoparticle), which will lead to a decrease in decay time rate of the current and voltage dependences.</p>

            <h2>Origin of local magnetic exchange interaction in infiite-layer nickelates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yanbing Zhou, Dan Zhao, Boyun Zeng, Chengliang Xia, Yu Wang, Hanghui Chen, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen</p>
            <p>Significant magnetic exchange interactions have been observed in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO2 (R = La, Pr, Nd), which exhibit unconventional superconductivity upon hole doping. Despite their structural and Fermi surface similarities to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates possess a larger charge transfer gap, which influences their magnetic exchange interactions via oxygen. In this work, we performed 17O nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on LaNiO2 and Sr-doped LaNiO2, revealing glassy spin dynamics originating from Ni-O planes. This indicates that infinite-layer nickelates are in proximity to magnetic ordering and that magnetic correlations play a crucial role in their physics. More importantly, our analysis of the Knight shift and hyperfine coupling of 17O nuclei revealed that the Ni-Ni superexchange interaction, mediated by the {\sigma} bond between the Ni-dx2-y2 and O-p orbitals, is one order of magnitude weaker than that in cuprates. This alone cannot account for the total magnetic exchange interaction observed in nickelates. First-principles many-body calculations indicate that an interstitial s orbital near the Fermi level, coupled with the Ni-d3z2-r2 orbital, significantly enhances the superexchange interaction. This contrasts with cuprates, where magnetic interactions are predominantly governed by Cu-dx2-y2 superexchange via oxygen. Our findings provide new insights into the distinct magnetic interactions in infinite-layer nickelates and their potential role in unconventional superconductivity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weikai Qi, Shreya Tiwary, Richard K. Bowles</p>
            <p>We use molecular dynamics simulation to study the relationship between structure and dynamics in supercooled binary Lennard--Jones nanoparticles over a range of particle sizes. The glass transition temperature of the nanoparticles is found to be significantly lowered relative to the bulk, decreasing as $N^{-1/3}$ with decreasing particle size. This allows the nanoparticles to sample low energy states on the potential energy landscape and we are able to study their relaxation times, measured in terms of the intermediate scattering function, and their structure, measured in terms of locally favoured structures, to low temperatures. Our work shows that the growing relaxation times in the supercooled nanoparticles are coupled with the growth of physical clusters formed from favoured local structures in a way that is well described by the Random First Order Transition entropic droplet model, but with exponents that are dependent on the nanoparticle size.</p>

            <p>We study the domain walls (DW) in an asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with finite resources and a bottleneck. For large values of $\alpha,\,\beta$, which parametrize the entry and exit rates of the TASEP lane, and with {sufficiently large} resources, the DWs are independent of these parameters, revealing a {\em hitherto unknown universality}. Unusually, these are accompanied by boundary layers in the TASEP lane. These universal DWs replace the maximal current phases in TASEPs. For smaller values of $\alpha,\,\beta$, the DWs depend upon them, and hence are nonuniversal. Our studies show that both universal and nonuniversal DWs can appear for reservoirs with finite or unlimited capacity.</p>

Our approach suggests a hierarchy of increasingly complex elements in frustrated media, and opens a new strategy for rational design of sequential metamaterials.</p>

            <p>We probe experimentally a connection between coherence in the context of optical physics and the irreversibility present in heat transfer through an interface separating two media. The robustness of the experiment on the one hand, and the theoretical description taken from the statistical-mechanics treatment of the heat transfer problem, on the other hand, allows for the study of the arrow of time's problem within the clean and precise framework of experimental optical physics. The central aspect of the experiment is a light beam incident and split at an interface to produce a second common interaction point again at the interface. The experiment was carried out with two light sources that only differ in their coherence length. In the case of the highly coherent light source, we were able to combine the previously split parts of the light back into a single beam. This is indicative of the reversibility of the process of coherent light transmission through the interface. The light source with low coherence length, on the contrary, does not allow for such a recombination, thus producing an irreversible process. We explain how the latter case is analogous to the process of interfacial heat transport, thus establishing an important connection between optical non-coherence and irreversibility of transport phenomena. Our finding paves the way for the study of fundamental processes in heat transfer and the surge of irreversibility in the realm of optical physics.</p>

            <p>Isothermal information engines operate by extracting net work from a single heat bath through measurement and feedback control. In this work, we analyze a realistic active Szilard engine operating on a single active particle by means of steric interaction with an externally controlled mechanical element. In particular, we provide a comprehensive study of how finite measurement accuracy affects the engine's work and power output, as well as the cost of operation. Having established the existence of non-trivial optima for work and power output, we study the dependence of their loci on the measurement error parameters and identify conditions for their positivity under one-shot and cyclic engine operation. By computing a suitably defined information efficiency, we also demonstrate that this engine design allows for the violation of Landauer's bound on the efficiency of information-to-work conversion. Notably, the information efficiency for one-shot operation exhibits a discontinuous transition and a non-monotonic dependence on the measurement precision. Finally, we show that cyclic operation improves information efficiency by harvesting residual mutual information between successive measurements.</p>

The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raghunandan Pratoori, Hamed Babaei, Valery I. Levitas</p>
            <p>Zirconium (Zr) is an important engineering material with numerous practical applications. It undergoes martensitic $\alpha$ to $\omega$ phase transformation (PT) at pressures that vary from 0.67 GPa to 17 GPa under different loading conditions. Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies, the effect of the nonhydrostatic stresses is not well understood. To separate the effect of nonhydrostatic stresses from the plastic deformation, a scale-free phase field approach (PFA) for multivariant $\alpha$ to $\omega$ PT in a single crystal Zr under general nonhydrostatic loadings is presented. Explicit conditions for the direct and reverse PTs between austenite and martensitic variants and between martensitic variants under general stress tensor are derived and analyzed. In particular, the effect of the deviatoric stresses on the PT pressures is elucidated. It is shown that their effect cannot explain much larger reduction in the transformation pressure observed during plastic flow, i.e., specific mechanisms of strain-induced phase transformations should be involved. Under assumption of the homogeneous fields in the sample, complete analytical solutions that include stress-strain curves during the PT, PT start and finish stresses (i.e., stress hysteresis), and volume fraction of the variants, are determined for different loadings. Finite element method (FEM) solutions are found for the phase field simulations of the microstructure evolution for the same loadings, as well as for two grains of the polycrystalline sample. Macroscopic averaged characteristics of the PFA solutions are well described by an analytical solution, which also simplifies their interpretations. Obtained results are in good qualitative agreement with existing experiments. In addition, some controversies of the previous approaches are analysed.</p>

            <p>The magnetic property of the Heusler alloys can be predicted by the famous Slater-Pauling (S-P) rule, which states the total magnetic moment ($m_t$) of such materials can be expressed as $m _t\,=\,(N_V-24)\,\mu_B/f.u.$, where $N_V$ is the total valence electron count (VEC). Consequently, no Heusler alloys having VEC = 24 are theoretically expected as well as experimentally reported to have any magnetic ordering. Recently, a special class of Heusler alloys with 50\% concentration of $p$-block elements (anti-Heusler) have been identified, although none of such reported compounds belong to the VEC 24 category. Here, we report a new anti-Heusler alloy, Al$_2$MnCu, that undergoes long-range ferromagnetic (FM) ordering with $T_{\rm C}\sim$315 K and a large magnetic moment of $\sim$1.8 $\mu_B$/f.u. despite having VEC 24. A phenomenological model based on molecular orbital hybridization is also proposed to understand the magnetism and unusual deviation from the standard S-P rule.</p>

            <p>The development of magnonic devices requires energy-efficient methods for generating spin waves and controlling their parameters. Acoustic waves are known to excite spin waves resonantly with magneto-elastic wave formation or to drive non-resonantly forced magnetization oscillations. Short acoustic wavevpackets enable another resonant interaction regime - Cherenkov radiation of spin waves. This poses a question on the criteria and signatures of transitions between these three regimes of a picosecond magnetoacoustic. Here, we use the scanning magneto-optical pump-probe technique to directly reveal all three regimes of interactions of laser-driven acoustic and magnetostatic wave packets in a thin permalloy film and a waveguide on top of a (011)-Si substrate. Direct measurements of the phase velocities revealed the transition from coupled magneto-elastic wavepacket to Cherenkov-like radiation and non-resonant regime controlled by the detuning between magnon and phonon group velocities. Acoustic pulse is found to be affected by the excited magnetization dynamics only in the magneto-elastic regime.</p>

            <p>Triangulenes are prototypical examples of open-shell nanographenes. Their magnetic properties, arising from the presence of unpaired $\pi$ electrons, can be extensively tuned by modifying their size and shape or by introducing heteroatoms. Different triangulene derivatives have been designed and synthesized in recent years, thanks to the development of on-surface synthesis strategies. Triangulene-based nanostructures with polyradical character, hosting several interacting spin units, can be challenging to fabricate but are particularly interesting for potential applications in carbon-based spintronics. Here, we combine pristine and N-doped triangulenes into a more complex nanographene, \textbf{TTAT}, predicted to possess three unpaired $\pi$ electrons delocalized along the zigzag periphery. We generate the molecule on an Au(111) surface and detect direct fingerprints of multi-radical coupling and high-spin state using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. With the support of theoretical calculations, we show that its three radical units are localized at distinct parts of the molecule and couple via symmetric ferromagnetic interactions, which result in a $S=3/2$ ground state, thus demonstrating the realization of a molecular ferromagnetic Heisenberg-like spin trimer</p>

            <p>This study benchmarks the geometric, frequency, non-covalent (GFN) semi-empirical methods, GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF, against density functional theory (DFT) for the geometry optimization of small organic semiconductor molecules. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, angles, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, the choice of the method depending on the accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.</p>

            <p>The interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom is at the heart of some of the most astonishing phenomena found in condensed matter physics, for example, the condensation of electron pairs into a macroscopically coherent ground state in superconductors. In magnetic materials, magnetic interactions couple to lattice degrees of freedom resulting in magnetoelastic coupling - an effect that is typically small and only detectable on macroscopic samples. Here, we demonstrate giant magnetoelastic coupling in the correlated itinerant ferromagnet Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$. We establish control of the magnetism in the surface layer and use this control to probe the impact of the magnetism on its electronic and structural properties. By using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we reveal subtle changes in the electronic structure dependent on ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment between the surface and subsurface layers. We determine the consequences of the exchange force on the relaxation of the surface layer, exhibiting a giant magnetostriction. Our results provide a direct measurement of the impact of exchange interactions and correlations on structural details in a quantum material, reveal how electronic correlations result in strong electron-lattice coupling and establish Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ as a system to study magnetism in 2D.</p>

            <h2>Increasing the Hardness of Posiform Planting Using Random QUBOs for Programmable Quantum Annealer Benchmarking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske, Georg Hahn, Hristo Djidjev</p>
            <p>Posiform planting is a method for constructing QUBO problems with a single unique planted solution that can be tailored to arbitrary connectivity graphs. In this study we investigate making posiform planted QUBOs computationally harder by fusing many smaller random discrete coefficient spin-glass Ising models, whose global minimum energy is computed classically using classical binary integer programming optimization software, with posiform-planted QUBOs. The single unique ground-state solution of the resulting QUBO problem is the concatenation of (exactly one of) the ground-states of each of the smaller problems. We apply these modified posiform planted QUBOs to the task of benchmarking programmable D-Wave quantum annealers. The proposed method enables generating binary variable combinatorial optimization problems that cover the entire quantum annealing processor hardware graph, have a unique solution, are entirely hardware-graph-native, and can have tunable computational hardness. We benchmark the capabilities of three D-Wave superconducting qubit quantum annealing processors, having from 563 up to 5627 qubits, to sample the optimal unique planted solution of problems generated by our proposed method and compare them against simulated annealing and Gurobi. We find that the D-Wave QPU ground-state sampling success rate does not change with respect to the size of the random QUBOs we employ. Surprisingly, we find that some of these classes of QUBOs are solved at very high success rates at short annealing times compared to longer annealing times for the Zephyr connectivity graph QPUs.</p>

            <h2>Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elijah Pelofske</p>
            <p>The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough p such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of 1. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of 0 with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of 1 while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any p step.</p>

            <p>The origin of dark matter is a fundamental problem in physics. Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak Chern-Simons couplings to electromagnetism, gravity, and fermions. We propose a novel symmetry-breaking detection mechanism in magnetoelectric materials, allowing for a linear axionic coupling between magnetism and ferroelectric polarization. We focus on strain gradient Sr2IrO4, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field within the material. This mechanism amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. These signals can be detected by monitoring changes in macroscopic physical quantities, such as the magnetoelectric and magnetic responses. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism significantly enhances the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sanghyeon Park, Yuseung Hong, Hyunseo Choi</p>
            <p>The use of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in modern warfare cannot be disregarded due to their ease of use and potential for large-scale incapacitation. An effective countermeasure involves the physical adsorption of these agents, preventing their entry through the respiratory tract by non-specific adsorption. In this study, we investigate the physical interaction between potential adsorbents and model gases mimicking CWAs, thereby identifying sufficient conditions for higher physical adsorption performance. Our findings reveal that the physical adsorption capacity is highly sensitive to the surface properties of the adsorbents, with uniform development of micropores, rather than solely high surface area, emerging as a critical factor. Additionally, we identified the potential of porous organic polymers as promising alternatives to conventional activated carbon-based adsorbents. Through a facile introduction of polar sulfone functional groups on the polymer surface, we demonstrated that these polar surface polymers exhibit physical adsorption capabilities for formaldehyde under ambient conditions comparable to high-performance activated carbons. Notably, the superior activated carbon possessed a high BET surface area of 2400 m^2/g and an exceptionally uniform micropore structure with an average pore size of approximately 11 Angstroms. This research paves the way for designing adsorbents with high physical adsorption capacities tailored for CWAs protection, offering a significant advancement in developing next-generation protective materials.</p>

            <p>Experimentally acquired microscopy images are unavoidably affected by the presence of noise and other unwanted signals, which degrade their quality and might hide relevant features. With the recent increase in image acquisition rate, modern denoising and restoration solutions become necessary. This study focuses on image decomposition and denoising of microscopy images through a workflow based on total variation (TV), addressing images obtained from various microscopy techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our approach consists in restoring an image by extracting its unwanted signal components and subtracting them from the raw one, or by denoising it. We evaluate the performance of TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$ in achieving this goal in distinct study cases. Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible one, while TGV-$L^1$ is the most suitable for denoising. Our results suggest a wider applicability of this method in microscopy, restricted not only to STM, AFM, and SEM images. The Python code used for this study is publicly available as part of AiSurf. It is designed to be integrated into experimental workflows for image acquisition or can be used to denoise previously acquired images.</p>

            <p>Peptides are recognized for their varied self-assembly behaviors, forming a wide array of structures and geometries, such as spheres, fibers, and hydrogels, each presenting a unique set of material properties. The functionalities of these materials hold exceptional interest for applications in biology, medicine, photonics, nanotechnology and the food industry. In specific, the ability to exploit peptides as viable and sustainable mechanical materials requires sequence design that enables superior performance, notably a high Young's modulus. As the peptide sequence space is vast, however, even a slight increase in sequence length leads to an exponential increase in the number of potential peptide sequences to be characterized. Here, we combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, atomic force microscopy experiments and machine learning models to correlate the sequence length and composition with the mechanical properties of self-assembled peptides. We calculate the Young's modulus for all possible amino acid sequences of di- and tripeptides using high-throughput coarse-grained methods, and validate these calculations through in-situ mechanical characterization. For pentapeptides, we select and calculate properties for a subset of sequences to train a machine learning model, which allows us to predict the modulus for other sequences. The combined workflow not only identifies promising peptide candidates with exceptional mechanical performances, but also extends current understanding of the sequence-to-function relationships for peptide materials, for specific applications.</p>

            <p>Nucleons are known to form pairing correlations with various types of spin-symmetries. Spin-singlet neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing is abundant in the nuclear chart but spin-triplet and mixed-spin proton-neutron pairing correlations have also been predicted to form at least in the ground states of certain nuclei. A realistic candidate region is that of the lightest Lanthanides where it was recently demonstrated that the nuclear deformation expected to emerge enhances spin-triplet pairing correlations. In this paper we provide the details of the deformed multimodal Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov theory that lead to this conclusion, as well as the details of the effects identified. We present in detail the response of different pairing correlations to various deformation modes and calculate their signatures in the odd-even staggering of masses. This paper provides a detailed discussion, and some resolutions, on the long-standing question ``what is the effect of nuclear deformation on the various pairing correlations?''</p>

            <p>Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms, hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.</p>

When the state considered is a Gibbs state of a local, commuting Hamiltonian at positive temperature, we show that the spectral gap of the canonical purified Hamiltonian provides a lower bound to the spectral gap of a large class of reversible generators of quantum Markov semigroup, including local and ergodic Davies generators. As an application of our construction, we show that the mixing condition is always satisfied for any finite-range 1D model, as well as by Kitaev's quantum double models.</p>

            <p>Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.</p>

            <p>The discovery of novel functional materials is crucial in addressing the challenges of sustainable energy generation and climate change. Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have gained attention for their exceptional optoelectronic properties in photovoltaics. Recently, geometric deep learning, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown strong potential in predicting material properties and guiding material design. However, traditional GNNs often struggle to capture the periodic structures and higher-order interactions prevalent in such systems. To address these limitations, we propose a novel representation based on quotient complexes (QCs) and introduce the Quotient Complex Transformer (QCformer) for material property prediction. A material structure is modeled as a quotient complex, which encodes both pairwise and many-body interactions via simplices of varying dimensions and captures material periodicity through a quotient operation. Our model leverages higher-order features defined on simplices and processes them using a simplex-based Transformer module. We pretrain QCformer on benchmark datasets such as the Materials Project and JARVIS, and fine-tune it on HOIP datasets. The results show that QCformer outperforms state-of-the-art models in HOIP property prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness. The quotient complex representation and QCformer model together contribute a powerful new tool for predictive modeling of perovskite materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhenyu Du, Yifan Tang, Andreas Elben, Ingo Roth, Jens Eisert, Zhenhuan Liu</p>
            <p>Quantum learning encounters fundamental challenges when estimating non-linear properties, owing to the inherent linearity of quantum mechanics. Although recent advances in single-copy randomized measurement protocols have achieved optimal sample complexity for specific tasks like state purity estimation, generalizing these protocols to estimate broader classes of non-linear properties without sacrificing optimality remains an open problem. In this work, we introduce the observable-driven randomized measurement (ORM) protocol enabling the estimation of ${\rm Tr}(O\rho^2)$ for an arbitrary observable $O$ -- an essential quantity in quantum computing and many-body physics. ORM achieves this by decomposing the observable $O$ into dichotomic observables and extracting the information of each eigenspace through randomized measurements with block-diagonal unitaries. We establish an upper bound for ORM's sample complexity and prove its optimality for all Pauli observables, closing a gap in the literature. Furthermore, we develop simplified variants of ORM for local Pauli observables and introduce a braiding randomized measurement protocol for fidelity estimation, both of which significantly reduce circuit complexities in practical applications. Numerical experiments validate that ORM requires substantially fewer state samples to achieve the same precision compared to classical shadows.</p>

            <p>The study of chaotic systems, where rare events play a pivotal role, is essential for understanding complex dynamics due to their sensitivity to initial conditions. Recently, tools from large deviation theory, typically applied in the context of stochastic processes, have been used in the study of chaotic systems. Here, we study dynamical observables, $A = \sum_{n=1}^N g(\textbf{x}_n)$, defined along a chaotic trajectory $\{\textbf{x}_1, \textbf{x}_2, \ldots, \textbf{x}_N\}$. For most choices of $g(\textbf{x})$, $A$ satisfies a central limit theorem: At large sequence size $N \gg 1$, typical fluctuations of $A$ follow a Gaussian distribution with a variance that scales linearly with $N$. Large deviations of $A$ are usually described by the large deviation principle, that is, $P(A) \sim e^{- N I(A/N)}$, where $I(a)$ is the rate function. We find that certain dynamical observables exhibit a remarkable statistical universality: even when constructed with distinct functions $g_1(\textbf{x})$ and $g_2(\textbf{x})$, different observables are described by the same rate function. We provide a physical interpretation for this striking universality by showing that $g_1(\textbf{x})-g_2(\textbf{x})$ belongs to a class of functions that we call ``derived''. Furthermore, we show that if $g(\textbf{x})$ itself is ``derived'', then the distribution of $A$ becomes independent of $N$ in the large-$N$ limit, and is generally non-Gaussian (although it is mirror-symmetric). We demonstrate that the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) for the logistic map is of this derived form, thus providing a simple explanation for some existing results.</p>

            <p>Materials with strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) are essential for realizing spin orbit torque (SOT) based magnetic memory devices. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for such appli cations because of their inherently high SOC strength. In this study, we investigate the spin pumping effect at the interface between a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (ML-MoS2) and Ni80Fe20 (Py) thin films using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. FMR measurements reveal a notable enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping factor for the ML-MoS2/Py (Pt = 0 nm) interface compared to the reference Py thin films, attributed to spin pumping across the ML-MoS2/Py interface. To further quantify spin pumping efficiency, we introduce a high SOC platinum (Pt) interlayer at the ML-MoS2/Py interface and systematically vary its thickness. This allows us to evaluate key spin transport parameters, including the enhancement in the effective Gilbert damping parameter, the effective spin mixing conductance that reflects the transfer of spin angular momentum from Py to ML-MoS2 and the effective spin current density.</p>

Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in spin-photon coupling and spin-spin entanglement. However, coupling between the electron and nuclear spins introduces a phase kickback during optical excitation that limits the utility of the nuclear memory. Here, we propose using the large hyperfine coupling of SnV-117 to operate the device at zero magnetic field in a regime where the memory is insensitive to optical excitation. We further demonstrate ground state spin control of a SnV-117 color center integrated in a photonic integrated circuit, showing 97.8% gate fidelity and 2.5 ms coherence time for the memory spin level. This shows the viability of the zero-field protocol for high fidelity operation, and lays the groundwork for building quantum network nodes with SnV-117 devices.</p>

            <p>Rydberg atoms allow for the experimental study of open many-body systems and nonequilibrium phenomena. High dephasing rates are a generic feature of these systems, and therefore they can often be described by rate equations, i.e. in the classical limit. In this work, we analyze one potential origin of the decoherence in Rydberg atoms: dipole-force induced dephasing. As the wave function of the Rydberg (spin-up) state is repelled in the presence of another nearby Rydberg atom, while the ground (spin-down) state diffuses in place, the Franck-Condon overlap between the two spin components quickly decays causing a decoherence of the spin transition. With an analytic approach we obtain a simple expression for the dephasing rate of the Rydberg state depending on atomic and laser parameters, which agrees with numerical findings.</p>

            <p>We investigate the spin states obtained by extracting $n$ electrons from closed-shell fermionic states. A partition of the system is defined through the introduction of the extraction modes. We derive the expression of the $n$-body reduced density matrices, which represent the extracted spin states. We show that these states exhibit different forms of spin entanglement, whose detection is discussed in terms of the spin squeezing inequalities.</p>

            <p>Quantum entanglement is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing, and its controlled generation and detection remain key challenges in scalable quantum architectures. Here, we numerically demonstrate the deterministic generation of entangled spin states in a solid-state platform by implementing quantum gates via electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (ESR-STM). Using two titanium atoms on a MgO/Ag(100) substrate as a model, we construct a two-qubit system whose dynamics are coherently manipulated through tailored microwave pulse sequences. We generate Bell states by implementing a Hadamard gate followed by a controlled-NOT gate, and evaluate its fidelity and concurrence using the quantum-master equation-based code TimeESR. Our results demonstrate that ESR-STM can create entangled states with significant fidelity. This study paves the way for the realization of atom-based quantum circuits and highlights ESR-STM as a powerful tool for probing and engineering entangled states on surfaces.</p>

            <h2>Production-ready double-side fabrication of dual-band infrared meta-optics using deep-UV lithography</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Sun, Xingzhao Yan, Jordan Scott, Jun-Yu Ou, James N. Monks, Otto L. Muskens</p>
            <p>Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johann Toudert, Rosalía Serna, Javier Martín Sánchez, Juan I. Larruquert, Lorenzo Calvo-Barrío</p>
            <p>Silicon dominates electronics, optoelectronics, photovoltaics and photonics thanks to its suitable properties, abundance, and well-developed cost-effective manufacturing processes. Recently, crystalline silicon has been demonstrated to be an appealing alternative plasmonic material, both for the infrared where free-carrier plasmons are enabled by heavy doping, and for the ultraviolet where plasmonic effects are induced by interband transitions. Herein, we demonstrate that nanostructured amorphous silicon exhibits such so-called interband plasmonic properties in the ultraviolet, as opposed to the expectation that they would only arise in crystalline materials. We report optical plasmon resonances in the 100-to-300 nm wavelength range in ultrathin nanostructures. These resonances shift spectrally with the nanostructure shape and the nature of the surrounding matrix, while their field enhancement properties turn from surface plasmonic to epsilon-near-zero plasmonic. We present a vacuum ultraviolet wavelength- and polarization-selective ultrathin film absorber design based on deeply-subwavelength anisotropically-shaped nanostructures. These findings reveal amorphous silicon as a promising material platform for ultracompact and room-temperature-processed ultraviolet plasmonic devices operating down to vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths, for applications including anticounterfeiting, data encryption and storage, sensing and detection. Furthermore, these findings raise a fundamental question on how plasmonics can be based on amorphous nanostructures.</p>

Here, we investigate the resonant interaction between a two-level emitter and a chiral flat band hosted by a photonic lattice. In the weak coupling regime, the emitter undergoes Rabi oscillations with a lifted photonic mode whose spatial structure reflects the nature of compact localized states and the onset of Anderson localization. We illustrate our approach using selected chiral quasi-1D lattices. Our findings provide a route to flat band state preparation via quench dynamics while preserving the structure of the flat band.</p>

            <p>We adapt recent ideas for many-body chaos in nonlinear, Hamiltonian fluids [Murugan \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 124501 (2021)] to revisit the question of the Reynolds number Re dependence of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda\propto{\rm Re}^\alpha$ in fully developed turbulence. The use of such decorrelators allow us to investigate the interplay of the competing effects of viscous dissipation and nonlinearity. We obtain a precise value of $\alpha = 0.59 \pm 0.04$ and show that departure from the Kolmogorov mean field result $\lambda \propto \sqrt{\rm Re}$ is a consequence of the intermittent fluctuations in the velocity-gradient tensor. The robustness of our results are further confirmed in a local, dynamical systems model for turbulence.</p>

            <p>We report on experimental studies of the distribution of the off-diagonal elements of the scattering matrix of open microwave networks with symplectic symmetry and a chaotic wave dynamics. These consist of two geometrically identical subgraphs with unitary symmetry described by complex conjugate Hamiltonians, that are coupled by a pair of bonds. The results are compared to random-matrix theory predictions obtained on the basis of the Heidelberg approach for the scattering matrix of open quantum-chaotic systems. We demonstrate that deviations from random-matrix theory predictions observed in the distributions may be attributed to the fact that the subgraphs are not fully connected.</p>

            <p>The liquid-vapor transition is a classic example of a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition. Such transitions underlie many phenomena in cosmology, nuclear and particle physics, and condensed-matter physics. They give rise to long-lived metastable states, whose decay can be driven by either thermal or quantum fluctuations. Yet, direct experimental observations of how these states collapse into a stable phase remain elusive in the quantum regime. Here, we use a trapped-ion quantum simulator to observe the real-time dynamics of ``bubble nucleation'' induced by quantum fluctuations. Bubbles are localized domains of the stable phase which spontaneously form, or nucleate, and expand as the system is driven across a discontinuous quantum phase transition. Implementing a mixed-field Ising spin model with tunable and time-dependent interactions, we track the microscopic evolution of the metastable state as the Hamiltonian parameters are varied in time with various speeds, bringing the system out of equilibrium. Site-resolved measurements reveal the emergence and evolution of finite-size quantum bubbles, providing direct insight into the mechanism by which the metastable phase decays. We also identify nonequilibrium scaling behavior near the transition, consistent with a generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our results demonstrate the power of quantum simulators to probe out-of-equilibrium many-body physics, including quantum bubble nucleation, a key feature of discontinuous quantum phase transitions, with application to studies of matter formation in the early universe.</p>

By a combination of field theory and symmetry analysis, an extended gapless phase with an emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry is found in the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma-DM chain.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michalis Chatzittofi, Ramin Golestanian, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo</p>
            <p>The dynamics of many nanoscale biological and synthetic systems such as enzymes and molecular motors are activated by thermal noise, and driven out-of-equilibrium by local energy dissipation. Because the energies dissipated in these systems are comparable to the thermal energy, one would generally expect their dynamics to be highly stochastic. Here, by studying a thermodynamically-consistent model of two coupled noise-activated oscillators, we show that this is not always the case. Thanks to a novel phenomenon that we term topological phase locking (TPL), the coupled dynamics become quasi-deterministic, resulting in a greatly enhanced average speed of the oscillators. TPL is characterized by the emergence of a band of periodic orbits that form a torus knot in phase space, along which the two oscillators advance in rational multiples of each other. The effectively conservative dynamics along this band coexists with the basin of attraction of the dissipative fixed point. We further show that TPL arises as a result of a complex, infinite hierarchy of global bifurcations. Our results have implications for understanding the dynamics of a wide range of systems, from biological enzymes and molecular motors to engineered nanoscale electronic, optical, or mechanical oscillators.</p>

            <h2>Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit</p>
            <p>In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.</p>

            <p>The recently discovered dipole-octupole pyrochlore magnet Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ is a promising three-dimensional quantum spin liquid candidate which shows no signs of ordering at low temperature. The low energy effective pseudospin-1/2 description in a magnetic field is characterized by the XYZ Hamiltonian and a Zeeman term where the dipolar local $z$-component of the pseudospin couples to the local $z$-component of the applied magnetic field, while the local $x$- and $y$-components of the pseudospin remain decoupled as a consequence of their octupolar character. Using effective Hamiltonian parameters determined in V. Poree et al., arXiv:2305.08261 (2023), remarkable experimental features can be reproduced, as for instance the specific heat and magnetization data as well as the continuum of states seen in neutron scattering. Here we investigate the thermodynamic response to magnetic fields applied along the global [110] direction using specific heat measurements and fits using numerical methods, and solve the corresponding magnetic structure using neutron diffraction. Specific heat data in moderate fields are reproduced well, however, at high fields the agreement is not satisfactory. We especially observe a two-step release of entropy, a finding that demands a review of both theory and experiment. We address it within the framework of three possible scenarios, including an analysis of the crystal field Hamiltonian not restricted to the two-dimensional single-ion doublet subspace. We conclusively rule out two of these scenarios and find qualitative agreement with a simple model of field misalignment with respect to the crystalline direction. We discuss the implications of our findings for [111] applied fields and for future experiments on Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$ and its sister compounds.</p>

These results are compared with the predictions of a relativistic, ab-initio theory, which incorporates superconducting correlations. We find good agreement with experiment, coming from a rich interplay between superconducting proximity - and quantum size effects, mediated by Andreev bound states.

            <h2>Ineffectiveness of Formamidine in Suppressing Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Cubic Hybrid Perovskite FAPbI3</h2>

            <p>Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate that the widely used plasma analogy is unreliable at predicting edge properties of quantum Hall states. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between quantum Hall droplets and plasmas (Coulomb gases): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. Consequently, the plasma analogy fails at the edge, except in fine-tuned geometries, as it does not account for the emergent local edge velocity. We quantitatively show how the analogy's failure affects physical quantities, such as fluctuations of local observables and absorption rates in microwave spectroscopy, measurable in both solid-state experiments and quantum simulators.</p>

Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse-grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. The coarsening scales range is measured too.</p>

            <p>The cluster chain with $\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order is decomposed into two distinct bilinear parafermionic chains, each possessing intrinsic topological order. These chains are formed by standard parafermions and time-reversal parafermions, respectively. Each subsystem retains its own $\mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetry component, which characterizes the total parity of constituent particles. Their topological orders are inherited from the two SPT orders of the cluster model. The transformations of particles under reflection, translation, and time reversal are derived. In the open chain, four zero-energy parafermionic edge modes are identified, and their structure is analyzed. For the closed system, the boundaries are twisted by the total parafermion parity. It is shown that the open chain is reflection-invariant when the number of spins is even, and $\mathcal{PT}$-invariant when the number of spins is odd. Meanwhile, the closed model exhibits a symmetry characterized by an antiunitary analog of the dihedral group.</p>

            <p>Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</p>

Through multislice electron scattering simulations and multislice ptychographic reconstructions, we investigate the phase contrast arising from individual silicon vacancies, antisite defects, and a wide range of substitutional transition metal dopants (V\textsubscript{Si} to W\textsubscript{Si}) and potential detectability. Simulating defect types, positions, and microscope conditions, we show that isolated point defects can be located within a unit cell along the sample's depth. The influence of electron energy, dose, defocus, and convergence semi-angle is also explored to determine their role in governing defect contrast.

            <h2>High-efficiency quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for extracting entanglement entropy in interacting fermion systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Weilun Jiang, Gaopei Pan, Zhe Wang, Bin-Bin Mao, Heng Shen, Zheng Yan</p>
            <p>The entanglement entropy probing novel phases and phase transitions numerically via quantum Monte Carlo has made great achievements in large-scale interacting spin/boson systems. In contrast, the numerical exploration in interacting fermion systems is rare, even though fermion systems attract more attentions in condensed matter. The fundamental restrictions is that the computational cost of fermion quantum Monte Carlo ($\sim \beta N^3$) is much higher than that of spin/boson ($\sim \beta N$). Here, $N$ is the total number of sites and $\beta$ is the inverse temperature or projection length. To tackle this problem, we propose a fermionic quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on the incremental technique along physical parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of extracting entanglement entropy. We benchmark the developed algorithm by calculating the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The obtained phase diagram including Fermi surface and Goldstone modes validates the correctness of the algorithm. Remarkably, our method shows the high-efficiency with respect to the existing algorithms, while keeping the high computation precision. We proceed to apply this algorithm to explore the scaling behavior of the entanglement entropy and particularly its derivative at Gross-Neveu criticality. Our results elucidate that such critical behavior can be quantified by the correlation length exponent.</p>

            <p>A series of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 (Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5; x = 0 to 0.3) bulks are prepared by conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas pressure and high temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) methods. These bulks are well characterized by structural and microstructural analysis, Raman spectroscopy, transport, and magnetic measurements. The HP-HTS process of the parent bulks has enhanced the onset transition temperature (Tconset) by 1.5 K and the critical current density (Jc) by two orders of magnitude compared to the CSP method. Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 up to 10% doping content prepared, either CSP or HP-HTS, slightly increases the unit cell volume, and high-pressure growth produces an almost pure superconducting phase, which confirms the successful Pr-doping at Fe sites. Raman spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations suggest the substitution of Pr-atoms in the interlayer spacing of Fe(Se,Te) lattice. High-pressure growth of Fe1-xPrxSe0.5Te0.5 also makes the sample less dense compared to the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Transport and magnetic measurements depict that Tconset is almost unaffected by Pr-doping, whereas Jc of Pr-doped FeSe0.5Te0.5 is enhanced by one order of magnitude relative to the parent sample developed by CSP but lower than that of the parent sample grown by HP-HTS. Hence, Pr- doping at Fe sites preserves Tconset and improves Jc of FeSe0.5Te0.5 regardless of the doping contents and growth conditions. These results are promising for the practical application of iron-based superconductors to improve Jc properties without affecting Tconset through CSP process and congruent with discoveries from other superconductors, like cuprates and MgB2.</p>

            <h2>Permutation Entropy for the Characterization of the Attractive Hamiltonian Mean-Field Model</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Melissa Fuentealba, Danilo M. Rivera, Roberto E. Navarro</p>
            <p>The Hamiltonian Mean-Field (HMF) model is a long-range interaction model that exhibits quasi-stationary states associated with a phase transition. Its quasi-stationary states with a lifetime diverging with the number of particles in the system. These states are characterized by homogeneous or non-homogeneous structures in phase-space. There exists a phase-transition between these states that have been traditionally characterized by the their mean magnetization. However, the magnetization also exhibits fluctuations in time around its mean value, that can be an indicator of the kind of quasi-stationary state. Thus, we want to characterize the quasi-stationary states of the HMF model through the time-series of the magnetization and its fluctuations through a measure of information, i.e. the permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane. Permutation entropy is a measure for characterizing chaotic time series, especially in the presence of dynamic and observational noise, as it is computationally and conceptually simple. For non-homogeneous states, the permutation entropy shows that the HMF model tends towards order, while the magnetizacion fluctuations reveal reduced structures in time. On the contrary, homogeneous states tend to disorder and the structures of the magnetization fluctuations increase as the initial magnetization is larger. In all the study cases of this thesis, the HMF model is characterized by low entropy values but the highest possible complexity value. Thus, the HMF model can be described as a chaotic, deterministic and intermitent system. This aligns with previous studies of the model in the phase space. The results demonstrate that the HMF model can be understood and interpreted from the fluctuations of magnetization using permutation entropy and the complexity-entropy plane.</p>

            <h2>Exploration of stable atomic configurations in graphene-like BCN systems by Bayesian optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taichi Hara, Akira Kusaba, Yoshihiro Kangawa, Tetsuji Kuboyama, David Bowler, Karol Kawka, Pawel Kempisty</p>
            <p>The h-BCN is an intriguing material system where the bandgap varies considerably depending on the atomic configuration, even at a fixed composition. Exploring stable atomic configurations in this system is crucial for discussing the energetic formability and controllability of desirable configurations. In this study, this challenge is tackled by combining first-principles calculations with Bayesian optimization. An encoding method that represents the configurations as vectors, while incorporating information about the local atomic environments, is proposed for the search. Although the optimization did not function with the conventional one-hot encoding that had been effective in other material systems, the proposed encoding proved efficient in the search. As a result, two interesting semiconductor configurations were discovered. These configurations exhibit qualitatively similar patterns to conventional models, and one of the two is more stable than the conventional ones with the same periodicity. Furthermore, the optimization behavior is discussed through principal component analysis, confirming that the ordered BN network and the C configuration features are well embedded in the search space. The proposed encoding method, which is easy to implement, is expected to expand the applicability of atomic configuration search using Bayesian optimization to a broader range of material systems.</p>

            <h2>Switchable Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Bogoliubov Modes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hsuan Lo, You Wang, Rimi Banerjee, Baile Zhang, Y. D. Chong</p>
            <p>Interacting or nonlinear lattices can host emergent particle-like modes, such as Bogoliubov quasiparticles, whose band topology and other properties are potentially highly tunable. Despite originating in the study of superconducting materials, Bogoliubov quasiparticles can also occur in synthetic metamaterials. Here, we implement a nonlinear driven-dissipative circuit whose fluctuations are Bogoliubov modes possessing nontrivial non-Hermitian band topology. We show experimentally that the system exhibits a switchable non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which abruptly appears when the on-site driving voltage amplitude exceeds a threshold. In contrast to earlier realizations of the NHSE and related phenomena in circuit models, the switchable NHSE in our system occurs in Bogoliubov modes, which are strongly affected by how the system is driven. Moreover, unlike other experimental platforms hosting non-Hermitian Bogoliubov modes, our system does not contain unconventional asymmetric hopping nonlinearities, only a local Kerr-type nonlinearity.</p>

            <p>Mixed anion halide-chalcogenide materials have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, making them promising candidates for various applications. Among these, CuBiSeCl_2 has recently been experimentally identified with remarkably low lattice thermal conductivity (k_L). In this study, we employ Wigner transport theory combined with neuroevolution machine learning potential (NEP)-assisted self-consistent phonon calculations to unravel the microscopic origins of this low k_L. Our findings reveal that the delocalization and weak bonding of copper atoms are key contributors to the strong phonon anharmonicity and wavelike tunneling (random walk diffusons). These insights deepen our understanding of the relationship between bonding characteristics, anharmonicity, delocalization, and vibrational dynamics, paving the way for the design and optimization of CuBiSeCl_2 and analogous materials for advanced phonon engineering applications.</p>

            <p>Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_{3}$, STO) stands out as a promising material for various electronic applications thanks to its exceptional dielectric properties. Molecular beam epitaxy is one of the few techniques which allows epitaxial growth of STO directly on industry-relevant silicon substrates. However, maintaining precise stoichiometry and high crystalline quality in this process remains a significant challenge. Establishing this is essential to obtain STO with bulk-like dielectric properties and to minimize leakage current and optical absorbance. In this study, the importance of cationic stoichiometry and the effect of thickness are investigated for STO thin films epitaxially grown on silicon. We employed real-time reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) as a feedback loop mechanism to counteract Sr source oxidation and maintain a constant flux. Additionally, high-temperature post-growth annealing treatments in O$_{2}$ were investigated to promote layer relaxation and reduce oxygen vacancy concentration, thereby improving the physical, electrical, and optical properties of stoichiometric STO. As a result, high-quality STO thin films exceeding 100 nm were successfully fabricated featuring a bulk-like out-of-plane lattice parameter and refractive index, as well as rocking curve full width at half maximum below 0.2°, smooth surface (R$_{q}$ < 0.2 nm) and a leakage current density below 1E-7 A/cm$^{2}$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kjell S. Heinrich, Henning G. Hugdal, Morten Amundsen, Sol H. Jacobsen</p>
            <p>We consider the effect of bending-strain in thin films of clean, conventional superconductors (S), and the proximity-induced effect of this strain in SN bilayers with a normal metal (N), and SNS junctions with equal curvatures in each superconductor. We find that the effective spin-orbit coupling due to strain in the superconductor induces both spin-polarized and unequal-spin even-frequency p-wave triplet pairings throughout the superconductor. When interfaced with a normal metal, additional odd-frequency pairings are induced, and their magnitudes can be tuned with the strain. In SNS junctions, the strain alone can induce a superconducting spin current in the junction. The spin-polarized current can undergo a $0-\pi$-transition, resulting in an in-plane, strain-induced magnetization that switches sign as a function of the strain. We discuss the underlying physics and its implications for superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p>Anderson localization describes disorder-induced phase transitions, distinguishing between localized and extended states. In quasiperiodic systems, a third multifractal state emerges, characterized by unique energy and wave functions. However, the corresponding multifractal-enriched mobility edges and three-state-coexisting quantum phases have yet to be experimentally detected. In this work, we propose exactly-solvable one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models that simultaneously host three-state-coexisting quantum phases, with their phase boundaries analytically derived via Avila's global theorem. Furthermore, we propose experimental protocols via Rydberg atom arrays to realize these states. Notably, we demonstrate a spectroscopic technique capable of measuring inverse participation ratios across real-space and dual-space domains, enabling simultaneous characterization of localized, extended, and multifractal quantum phases in systems with up to tens of qubits. Our work opens new avenues for the experimental exploration of Anderson localization and multifractal states in artificial quantum systems.</p>

            <p>In geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, weak interactions or slight changes to the structure can tip the delicate balance of exchange interactions, sending the system into a different ground state. Brochantite, Cu$_4$SO$_4$(OH)$_6$, has a copper sublattice composed of distorted triangles, making it a likely host for frustrated magnetism, but exhibits stacking disorder. The lack of synthetic single crystals has limited research on the magnetism in brochantite to powders and natural mineral crystals. We grew crystals which we find to be a new polytype with a tendency toward ABAC stacking and some anion disorder, alongside the expected stacking disorder. Comparison to previous results on natural mineral specimens suggests that cation disorder is more deleterious to the magnetism than anion and stacking disorder. Our specific heat data suggest a double transition on cooling into the magnetically ordered state.</p>

            <p>The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.</p>

            <p>We used our developed AI search engine~(InvDesFlow) to perform extensive investigations regarding ambient stable superconducting hydrides. A cubic structure Li$_2$AuH$_6$ with Au-H octahedral motifs is identified to be a candidate. After performing thermodynamical analysis, we provide a feasible route to experimentally synthesize this material via the known LiAu and LiH compounds under ambient pressure. The further first-principles calculations suggest that Li$_2$AuH$_6$ shows a high superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) $\sim$ 140 K under ambient pressure. The H-1$s$ electrons strongly couple with phonon modes of vibrations of Au-H octahedrons as well as vibrations of Li atoms, where the latter is not taken seriously in other previously similar cases. Hence, different from previous claims of searching metallic covalent bonds to find high-$T_c$ superconductors, we emphasize here the importance of those phonon modes with strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). And we suggest that one can intercalate atoms into binary or ternary hydrides to introduce more potential phonon modes with strong EPC, which is an effective approach to find high-$T_c$ superconductors within multicomponent compounds.</p>

            <h2>Topology Optimization of Pneumatic Soft Actuators Based on Porohyperelasticity</h2>

            <p>This paper introduces a new nonlinear topology optimization framework which employs porohyperelasticity for providing computational design of pneumatic soft actuators. Density-based topology optimization is used with the objective of maximizing the bending response in a soft actuator made of an elastomer, for given actuation pressure and external resistance. Pressurization of interconnected cavities is modeled via an extension of the Darcy flow theory that is valid for large deformations. Essential for the good performance of the framework is a carefully chosen interpolation scheme for the permeability between void and solid regions, as well as a suitable definition of a drainage term in the solid regions. Results are shown for a variety of actuation pressure and maximum allowable strain energy density levels, covering a wide range of system responses from small to rather large deformations.</p>

The wave function and the spectrum of the system are derived analytically, with the spectrum consisting of Landau levels modified by an additional term associated with the linear Stark effect, proportional to a complex constant $\lambda$. It is shown that this constant arises from an operator $\hat{\Pi}$ that commutes with the Hamiltonian, i.e., $\hat{\Pi}$ is a symmetry of the system. Finally, the Hall conductivity for the lowest Landau level is calculated, showing that it remains exactly equal to the inverse of Klitzing's constant despite the perturbation.</p>

Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anton O. Pokusinkyi, Oleksandr V. Dobrovolskiy</p>
            <p>Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</p>

            <p>KTaO3 single crystals with different orientations are used as substrates for the epitaxial growth of thin films and/or as hosts for two-dimensional electron gases. Due to the polar nature of the KTaO3(001) surface, one can expect difficulties and challenges to arise in its preparation. Maintaining good insulating characteristics without adding undesirable in-gap electronic states, obtaining good crystalline order up to the top surface layer, a sufficiently flat surface, and complete cleanliness of the surface (without water, C or OH contaminants), are in general difficult conditions to accomplish simultaneously. Cleaving in vacuum is likely the best option for obtaining a clean surface. However, since KTaO3 is cubic and lacks a well-defined cleavage plane, this method is notsuitable for sample growth or reproducible device fabrication. Here, we systematically evaluate the effect of typical preparation methods applied on the surfaces of KTaO3(001) single crystals. In particular, we used annealing in vacuum at different temperatures, light sputtering with Ar+ ions at low energy (500 eV) followed by annealing, heavy Ar+ ion bombardment and annealing, and grazing Ar+ ion bombardment under continuous azimuthal rotation combined with both annealing in vacuum and in O2 atmosphere. Possible side effects after each treatment are evaluated by a combination of techniques, including low-energy ion scattering at forward angles, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron energy loss, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and time of flightsecondary ion mass spectrometry. Advantages and shortcomings of each preparation method are discussed in detail.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhumita Kabiraj, Raka Dasgupta</p>
            <p>We study the finite and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases that survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose glass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</p>

            <p>We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.</p>

            <p>We consider the spin rotationally invariant Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (CSL) in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry and explore symmetry constraints on possible conventional spin crystal states accessible via a direct transition. These constraints provide a framework to identify topological invariants of the magnetically ordered state. We show that the existence of a direct transition from a CSL requires a precise compatibility condition between the topological invariants of the ordered state and the anomaly of the CSL. The lattice symmetries also constrain the functional form of the low-energy theory to describe these transitions. This allows us to construct explicit Chern-Simons-matter field theories for the transition into a class of noncoplanar orders identified as candidates directly accessible from the CSL, including the octahedral spin crystal on the kagomé lattice, and the tetrahedral order on the triangular and honeycomb lattice. These transitions can either be described using coupled fractionalized $ \mathbb{CP}^1 $ theories or fractionalized matrix principal chiral models. We also discuss extensions to more general magnetic ordering transitions out of the CSL.</p>

            <p>We study the escape dynamics of a non-Markovian stochastic process with time-averaged feedback, which we model as a one-dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process wherein the drift is modified by the empirical mean of its trajectory. This process maps onto a class of self-interacting diffusions. Using weak-noise large deviation theory, we derive the most probable escape paths and quantify their likelihood via the action functional. We compute the feedback-modified Kramers rate and its inverse, which approximates the mean escape time, and show that the feedback accelerates escape by storing finite-time fluctuations thereby lowering the effective energy barrier, and shifting the optimal escape time from infinite to finite. Although we identify alternative mechanisms, such as slingshot and ballistic escape trajectories, we find that they remain sub-optimal and hence do not accelerate escape. These results show how memory feedback reshapes rare event statistics, thereby offering a mechanism to potentially control escape dynamics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zachary G. Lipel, Yannick A. D. Omar, Dimitrios Fraggedakis</p>
            <p>Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.</p>

            <p>Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</p>

In the brain this scale invariance has been hypothesized to have several computational benefits, including increased collective sensitivity to changes in input and robust propagation of information across a circuit. However, our theoretical understanding of critical phenomena in neural circuitry is limited because standard renormalization group methods apply to systems with either highly organized or completely random connections. Connections between neurons lie between these extremes, and may be either excitatory (positive) or inhibitory (negative), but not both. In this work we develop a renormalization group method that applies to models of spiking neural populations with some realistic biological constraints on connectivity, and derive a scaling theory for the statistics of neural activity when the population is tuned to a critical point. We show that the scaling theories differ for models of in vitro versus in vivo circuits -- they belong to different "universality classes" -- and that both may exhibit "anomalous" scaling at a critical balance of inhibition and excitation. We verify our theoretical results on simulations of neural activity data, and discuss how our scaling theory can be further extended and applied to real neural data.</p>

            <p>Unlike a single Carroll particle, a multiparticle Carroll system can move under suitable conditions, as we demonstrate it explicitly for two particles with a momentum-dependent interaction: the center-of-mass remains fixed, however relative motion is possible, confirming previous statements made by Bergshoeff, Casalbuoni, and their collaborators. Analogous results are obtained for electric dipoles with the roles of the center-of-mass and the relative position interchanged.</p>

            <h2>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Vossel, Bert L. de Groot, Aljaž Godec</p>
            <p>Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</p>

            <h2>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Heeyuen Koh, Shigeo Maruyama</p>
            <p>The memory effect, which quantifies the interconnection between the target system and its environment, correlates states between distinct Hamiltonians. In this paper, we propose the diffusion process derived from Smoluchowski equation that can manifest the evolution of memory effect integration in non Markovian regime. The master equation from the Smoluchowski picture, within the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics, justifies the use of the diffusion process. The numerical experiments using collision between semiflexible polymers like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) confirm the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the correlated momentum between two Hamiltonians that compose coarse grained system of SWCNT. The diffusion process governs the nonlinear motion in both equilibrium and far from equilibrium states.</p>

            <h2>Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Orlando A. Mendible, Jonathan K. Whitmer, Yamil J. Colón</p>
            <p>Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) promise to accurately describe the potential energy surface of molecules at the ab initio level of theory with improved computational efficiency. Within MLFFs, equivariant graph neural networks (EQNNs) have shown great promise in accuracy and performance and are the focus of this work. The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces (FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on the accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). A generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and forces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle constraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in reproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of theory. Results indicate that the model's accuracy is unaffected by the distribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data includes configurations from characteristic regions of the system's FES. However, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the EQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free energy. In contrast, models trained with the same configurations on ab initio data show improved extrapolation accuracy. The findings underscore the difficulties in creating a comprehensive training dataset for EQNNs to predict FESs and highlight the importance of prior knowledge of the system's FES.</p>

            <h2>Viscoelastic Worthington jets & droplets produced by bursting bubbles</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ayush K. Dixit, Alexandros Oratis, Konstantinos Zinelis, Detlef Lohse, Vatsal Sanjay</p>
            <p>Bubble bursting and subsequent collapse of the open cavity at free surfaces of contaminated liquids can generate aerosol droplets, facilitating pathogen transport. After film rupture, capillary waves focus at the cavity base, potentially generating fast Worthington jets that are responsible for ejecting the droplets away from the source. While extensively studied for Newtonian fluids, the influence of non-Newtonian rheology on this process remains poorly understood. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations to investigate the bubble cavity collapse in viscoelastic media, such as polymeric liquids. We find that the jet and drop formation are dictated by two dimensionless parameters: the elastocapillary number $Ec$ (the ratio of the elastic modulus and the Laplace pressure) and the Deborah number $De$ (the ratio of the relaxation time and the inertio-capillary timescale). We show that for low values of $Ec$ and $De$, the viscoelastic liquid adopts a Newtonian-like behavior, where the dynamics are governed by the solvent Ohnesorge number $Oh_s$ (the ratio of visco-capillary and inertio-capillary timescales). In contrast, for large values $Ec$ and $De$, the enhanced elastic stresses completely suppress the formation of the jet. For some cases with intermediate values of $Ec$ and $De$, smaller droplets are produced compared to Newtonian fluids, potentially enhancing aerosol dispersal. By mapping the phase space spanned by $Ec$, $De$, and $Oh_s$, we reveal three distinct flow regimes: (i) jets forming droplets, (ii) jets without droplet formation, and (iii) absence of jet formation. Our results elucidate the mechanisms underlying aerosol suppression versus fine spray formation in polymeric liquids, with implications for pathogen transmission and industrial processes involving viscoelastic fluids.</p>

            <h2>Fast quantum gates for exchange-only qubits using simultaneous exchange pulses</h2>

            <p>The benefit of exchange-only qubits compared to other spin qubit types is the universal control using only voltage controlled exchange interactions between neighboring spins. As a compromise, qubit operations have to be constructed from non-orthogonal rotation axes of the Bloch sphere and result in rather long pulsing sequences. This paper aims to develop a faster implementation of single-qubit and two-qubit gates using simultaneous exchange pulses. We introduce pulse sequences in which single-qubit gates could be executed faster and show that subsequences on three spins in two-qubit gates could be implemented in fewer steps. Our findings can particularly speed up gate sequences for realistic idle times between sequential pulses and we show that this advantage increases with more interconnectivity of the quantum dots. We further demonstrate how a phase operation can introduce a relative phase between the computational and some of the leakage states, which can be advantageous for the construction of two-qubit gates. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we experimentally demonstrate and characterize a simultaneous exchange implementation of $X$ rotations in a SiGe quantum dot device and compare to the state of the art with sequential exchange pulses.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying world geography as seen through the lens of Soviet propaganda</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M.V. Tamm, M. Oiva, K.D. Mukhina, M. Mets, M. Schich</p>
            <p>Cultural data typically contains a variety of biases. In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series 'Novosti Dnya' (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.</p>
