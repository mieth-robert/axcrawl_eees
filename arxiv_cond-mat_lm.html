            <h2>Scaling of the disorder operator at (3+1)D O(3) quantum criticality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuyang Liang, Xiao-Chuan Wu, Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan, Dao-Xin Yao</p>
            <p>The disorder operator, as an easily measured non-local observable, displays great potential in detecting intrinsic information of field theories. It has been systematically studied in 1d and 2d quantum systems, while the knowledge of 3d is still limited. The disorder operator associated with U(1) global symmetry exhibits rich geometric dependence on the shape of the spatial region at a quantum critical point, meanwhile, (3+1)D is the upper critical dimension for O(N) criticalities, both of which pose a challenge for exploring the disorder operator in high dimensions. In this work, we investigate the scaling behaviors of disorder operators in (3+1)D O(3) models through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation combined with theoretical analysis. The universal contributions, such as the current central charge, have been revealed in our calculation, which establishes a concrete link between lattice simulations and continuum field theory. This work opens new avenues for experimental and numerical exploration of universal properties at quantum critical points in (3+1)D models.</p>

            <h2>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Universality of the Mott Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinchao Zhao, Peizhi Mai, Gaurav Tenkila, Philip W. Phillips</p>
            <p>We demonstrate that the Mott transition exhibits universal scaling as a consequence of the breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in momentum space. A direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line (temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality. Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\alpha$ where $\alpha\approx 1$. Finally, our computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\mathbb{Z}_2$ universality.</p>

            <h2>Sweet-spot protection of hole spins in sparse arrays via spin-dependent magneto-tunneling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, Biel Martínez, Ahmad Fouad Kalo, Yann-Michel Niquet, José C. Abadillo-Uriel</p>
            <p>Recent advances in the scaling of spin qubits have led to the development of sparse architectures where spin qubits are distributed across multiple quantum dots. This distributed approach enables qubit manipulation through hopping and flopping modes, as well as protocols for spin shuttling to entangle spins beyond nearest neighbors. Therefore, understanding spin tunneling across quantum dots is fundamental for the improvement of sparse array encodings. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of a minimal sparse array formed by a hole in a double quantum dot. We show the existence of spin-dependent magnetic corrections to the tunnel couplings that help preserve existing sweet spots, even for quantum dots with different $g$-factors, and introduce new ones that are not accounted for in the simplest models. Our analytical and numerical results explain observed sweet spots in state-of-the-art shuttling and cQED experiments, are relevant to hopping and flopping modes, and apply broadly to sparse array encodings of any size.</p>

            <h2>Spatially Structured Entanglement from Nonequilibrium Thermal Pure States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Bai, Mao Tian Tan, Bastien Lapierre, Shinsei Ryu</p>
            <p>We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems, starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, "Möbius-type" deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, "sine-square-type" and "displacement-type" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling, instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details. Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our (1+1)-dimensional study.</p>

            <h2>High Resolution Polar Kerr Effect Studies of Cs3Sb5 and ScV6Sn6 Below the Charge Order Transition</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David R. Saykin, Qianni Jiang, Zhaoyu Liu, Chandra Shekhar, Claudia Felser, Jiun-Haw Chu, Aharon Kapitulnik</p>
            <p>We report high resolution polar Kerr effect measurements on CsV3Sb5 and ScV6Sn6 single crystals in search for signatures of spontaneous polar Kerr effect (PKE) below the charge order transitions of these materials. Utilizing two separate zero-area loop Sagnac interferometers operating at 1550 nm and 830 nm wavelengths, we studied the temperature dependence of possible PKE after training with magnetic field. While a finite field Kerr measurement yielded optical rotation expected from the Pauli susceptibility of the itinerant carriers, no signal was detected at zero-field to within the noise floor limit of the apparatus of below $\sim$100 nanoradians. Simultaneous coherent reflection measurements confirm the sharpness of the charge order transition in the same optical volume as the Kerr measurements. Application of strain to reveal a hidden flux-ordered magnetic state did not result in a finite Kerr effect.</p>

            <h2>Photoinduced Electronic Band Dynamics and Defect-mediated Surface Potential Evolution in PdSe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Abdul-Aziz, Manuel Tuniz, Wibke Bronsch, Fulvio Parmigiani, Federico Cilento, Daniel Wolverson, Charles J. Sayers, Giulio Cerullo, Claudia Dallera, Ettore Carpene, Paul H. M. van Loosdrecht, Hamoon Hedayat</p>
            <p>We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) combined with density functional theory to investigate ultrafast carrier dynamics in low-symmetry layered semiconducting PdSe$_2$. The indirect bandgap is determined to be 0.55~eV. Following photoexcitation above this gap, we resolve a valence band shift and broadening, both lasting less than a picosecond, consistent with bandgap renormalization and carrier scattering, indicative of strong many-body interactions. Subsequently, hot carriers populate the conduction band minimum and are captured by defect states. A surface photovoltage (SPV) of $\sim$ 67~meV emerges, persisting for over 50~ps, driven by defect-assisted charge separation. The formation of native vacancies, promoted by the low-symmetry lattice, likely gives rise to the mid-gap states responsible for this long-lived SPV response. Detailed analysis of TR-ARPES spectra disentangles the contributions of bandgap renormalization, carrier scattering, defect states, and SPV. These findings establish PdSe$_2$ as a prototypical layered quantum material exhibiting exotic photoresponses on ultrafast timescales.</p>

            <h2>Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qile Wu, Seamus D. O Hara, Joseph B. Costello, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Ken W. West, Mark S. Sherwin</p>
            <p>Effective Hamiltonians are powerful tools for understanding the emergent phenomena in condensed matter systems. Reconstructing an effective Hamiltonian directly from experimental data is challenging due to the complex relationship between Hamiltonian parameters and observables. Complimentary to ARPES, which probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG and HSG have shown strong potential for Hamiltonian reconstruction. Here, we reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs based on HSG. Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of Bloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively connect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are known from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of GaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an additional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave interferometry. We thus demonstrate the full capability of Hamiltonian reconstruction by combining absorbance spectroscopy and HSG experiments. We find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is approximately 13\,meV higher than the expected value based on previous absorbance measurements. Quantum kinetic analysis suggests that, in the HSG experiments, the electron-hole energy could have been renormalized through Fröhlich interaction that is modified by the strong THz fields. We also show that the energy threshold in emission of optical phonons can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to nearly constant dephasing rates.</p>

            <h2>Direct observation of the surface superconducting gap in the topological superconductor candidate β-PdBi2</h2>

            <p>\beta-PdBi2 is one of the candidates for topological superconductors with a superconducting (SC) transition temperature (Tc) of 5.3 K, in which parity mixing of spin singlet and spin triplet has been anticipated, being crucial for the further understanding of relationship with inversion symmetry and parity mixing in the superconductivity. In this work, we measured the SC gap in high-quality single crystal of \beta-PdBi2 by using high-resolution laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy below Tc. We found the isotropic SC gaps in momentum space for multiple bands, and observed that the difference between the SC gap of the topological surface bands and the bulk bands is about 0.1 meV, consistent with other experimental results. These direct and quantitative experimental results support the possibility of \beta-PdBi2 as a topological superconductor, characterized by unique crystal and electronic band structures.</p>

            <h2>Exciton dynamics in equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pushpendra Yadav</p>
            <p>The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures. Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures, proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.</p>

            <h2>Laser-Induced Commensurate-Incommensurate Transition of Charge Order in a Hubbard Superlattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hua Chai, Zhenyu Cheng, Qinxin Hu, Zhongbing Huang, Xiang Hu, Xuedong Tian, Liang Du</p>
            <p>We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge density waves in a pumped one-dimensional Hubbard superlattice with staggered onsite Coulomb interactions at half-filling, using time-dependent exact diagonalization. In equilibrium, the system exhibits commensurate charge correlations consistent with the superlattice periodicity. Under laser excitation, the charge correlation function exhibits distinct behaviors across four representative frequencies, spanning both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. Notably, we observe a laser-induced commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in the charge order, manifested by a shift in the peak wavevector of the charge structure factor. This transition is driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon dynamics, where the laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly interacting sublattice. Our analysis of the excitation spectrum and site-resolved correlation dynamics reveals the underlying mechanisms of this transition. These results suggest a promising optical strategy for controlling charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Large electrocaloric strength in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals with a tuneable operational temperature range</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana I. Nikolova, Rachel Tuffin, Mengfan Guo, Neil D. Mathur, Xavier Moya, Peter Tipping, Richard J. Mandle, Helen F. Gleeson</p>
            <p>The electrocaloric (EC) effect offers a promising energy-efficient and clean cooling technology. We present the first direct measurements of EC temperature change in a new family of EC fluids, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FNLCs), demonstrating in two such materials temperature jumps of $|{\Delta}T_j|$ ~ 0.2 K for field changes as low as ${\Delta}E$ ~ 0.1 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$. Indirect measurements of adiabatic temperature change $|{\Delta}T|$ confirm that these direct measurements are an underestimate and that ${\Delta}E$ = 2 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$ can induce up to $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1.6 K, yielding EC strengths $|{\Delta}T/{\Delta}E|$ up to 100% higher than incumbent materials. For temperature spans of 5-10 K, we predict a coefficient of performance of ~21-40. We find $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1 K for >100 FNLCs that collectively span all temperatures between $0{^\circ}$C and $100{^\circ}$C. This, together with the new device concepts conceivable with fluid EC materials, offers huge potential for cooling applications.</p>

            <h2>Bi-isotropic effects on hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. Nonato, Pedro D. S. Silva</p>
            <p>In this work, we investigate the bi-isotropic effects in the formation and tunability of hybrid surface polaritons in bilayer configurations. We consider a heterostructure composed of a medium with bi-isotropic constitutive relations and an AFM layer. Using the transfer matrix formalism, we derive general expressions for the dispersion relations of surface polaritonic modes, including the dependence on the bi-isotropic parameter, and analyze their coupling to bulk magnon-polaritons. As an illustration of application, we consider a heterostructure formed with Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ interfaced with antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials that support terahertz-frequency magnons, specifically Cr$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and FeF$_{2}$. In the strong bi-isotropic coupling regime, the surface Dirac plasmon--phonon--magnon polariton (DPPMP) dispersion undergoes a pronounced redshift, accompanied by suppression of the characteristic anticrossing between the Dirac plasmon and the phonon. This effect, observed in all AFM materials considered, suggests a weakening of the hybrid interaction, possibly due to saturation or detuning mechanisms induced by increased $\alpha$. Furthermore, increasing the Fermi energy of the topological insulator enhances the surface plasmon and phonon contributions, inducing a blueshift of the DPPP branches and bringing them closer to resonance with the magnon mode, thereby increasing the hybridization strength. Intriguingly, this redshift partially compensates the blueshift induced by a higher Fermi level, restoring the system to a weak-coupling regime analogous to that observed at lower Fermi energies. Our findings reveal that both the Fermi level and the bi-isotropic response offer independent and complementary control parameters for tuning the strength of light--magnon coupling in TI/AFM heterostructures, with potential implications for reconfigurable THz spintronic and photonic devices.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Cayley trees, hyperbolic continuum, and BCS theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mykhailo Pavliuk, Tomáš Bzdušek, Askar Iliasov</p>
            <p>We investigate $s$-wave superconductivity in negatively curved geometries, focusing on Cayley trees and the hyperbolic plane. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for trees and a BCS treatment of the hyperbolic continuum, we establish a unified mean-field framework that captures the role of boundaries in hyperbolic spaces. For finite Cayley trees with open boundaries, the superconducting order parameter localizes at the edge while the interior can remain normal, leading to two distinct critical temperatures: $T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{edge} > T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{bulk}$. A corresponding boundary-dominated phase also emerges in hyperbolic annuli and horodisc regions, where radial variations of the local density of states enhance edge pairing. We also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states at the boundary is significantly more pronounced for the discrete tree geometry. Our results show that, owing to the macroscopic extent of the boundary, negative curvature can stabilize boundary superconductivity as a phase that persists in the thermodynamic limit on par with the bulk superconductivity. These results highlight fundamental differences between bulk and boundary ordering in hyperbolic matter, and provide a theoretical framework for future studies of correlated phases in negatively curved systems.</p>

            <h2>Strain Engineering of Altermagnetic Symmetry in Epitaxial RuO$_2$ Films</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johnathas D. S. Forte, Seung Gyo Jeong, Anand Santhosh, Seungjun Lee, Bharat Jalan, Tony Low</p>
            <p>The magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ has been under intense debate. Using first-principles calculations, we show that compressive strain along [001] direction stabilizes an altermagnetic phase in RuO$_2$ thin films grown on (100) and (110) TiO$_2$ substrates. We further identify that compressive strain enhances the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a Fermi surface instability and the emergence of altermagnetism. The magnitude of strain and the associated increase in the density of states can be tuned by varying the film thickness, as systematically confirmed by x-ray diffraction and photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Symmetry analysis further reveals that (100) RuO$_2$ hosts an ideal altermagnetic order, whereas broken symmetry in (110) films leads to an uncompensated ferrimagnetic state. Finally, we discuss the effects of Hubbard $U$ parameters and evaluate the realistic tunneling magnetoresistance of (100) RuO$_2$.</p>

            <h2>Dynamical control of Coulomb interactions and Hubbard bands in monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niklas Notter, Markus Aichhorn, Anna Galler</p>
            <p>Monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$ hosts a star-of-David charge-density wave (CDW) that stabilizes a low-temperature Mott-insulating state. Recent time-resolved spectroscopies indicate a coupling between the CDW amplitude mode and the electronic correlation strength, yet the role of the screened Coulomb interaction remains unclear. Using the constrained random-phase approximation, we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in two-dimensional quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Emergence of charge-$4e$ superconductivity from 2D nematic superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xuan Zou, Zhou-Quan Wan, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>Charge-$4e$ superconductivity is an exotic state of matter that may emerge as a vestigial order from a charge-$2e$ superconductor with multicomponent superconducting order parameters. Showing its emergence in a microscopic model from numerically-exact large-scale computations has been rare so far. Here, we propose a microscopic lattice model with a nematic superconducting ground state and show that it supports a rich set of vestigial phases at elevated temperature, including a charge-$4e$ phase and a quasi-long-range nematic phase, by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Combining theoretical analysis with Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover the nature of these phases and show that the phase transitions are governed by the proliferation of distinct topological defects: half superconducting vortices, $(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2})$ vortices, integer nematic vortices, and domain-wall excitations. In particular, we demonstrate that domain-wall proliferation is crucial for the quasi-nematic phase and should be carefully accounted for in phase transitions associated with vestigial charge-$4e$ order.</p>

            <h2>Role of Phase Fluctuation in Dynamic Competition Between Charge Order and Superconductivity in Cuprates</h2>

            <p>Phase fluctuations are a key factor distinguishing nonthermal (ultrafast) and thermal phase transitions. Charge order in cuprates is characterized by short-range coherence while competing with superconductivity, and as such, it provides a representative case to study the role of phase fluctuation in coupled order parameter dynamics. In this work, we investigated the intertwined evolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite heterostructures using time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering. The resulting dynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model capturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced suppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge order, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and superconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and recovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase fluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain suppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and phase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence. Our work underscores the importance of phase fluctuation for understanding the dynamic competition between order parameters in cuprates.</p>

            <h2>Spin Polarons in Flat Band Ferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saranesh Prembabu, Rahul Sahay, Stefan Divic, Ashvin Vishwanath</p>
            <p>Spin polarons are bound states of electrons and spin-flips that form above spin polarized electronic this http URL bound states conventionally form in one of two settings: in frustrated lattices with dispersive bands -- where the motion of an electron preferences binding a nearby spin-flip -- or in topological flat bands -- where the Chern number enforces an effective dipolar interaction between electrons and spin flips. In this work, we report the formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.</p>

            <h2>Equivalent class of Emergent Single Weyl Fermion in 3d Topological States: gapless superconductors and superfluids Vs chiral fermions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gabriel Meyniel, Fei Zhou</p>
            <p>In this article, we put forward a practical but generic approach towards constructing a large family of $(3+1)$ dimension lattice models which can naturally lead to a single Weyl cone in the infrared (IR) limit. Our proposal relies on spontaneous charge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking to evade the usual no-go theorem of a single Weyl cone in a 3d lattice. We have explored three concrete paths in this approach, all involving fermionic topological symmetry protected states (SPTs). Path a) is to push a gapped SPT in a 3d lattice with time-reversal symmetry (or $T$-symmetry) to a gapless topological quantum critical point (tQCP) which involves a minimum change of topologies,i.e. $\delta N_w=2$ where $\delta N_w$ is the change of winding numbers across the tQCP. Path b) is to peal off excessive degrees of freedom in the gapped SPT via applying $T$-symmetry breaking fields which naturally result in a pair of gapless nodal points of real fermions. Path c) is a hybrid of a) and b) where tQCPs, with $\delta N_w \geq 2$, are further subject to time-reversal-symmetry breaking actions. In the infrared limit, all the lattice models with single Weyl fermions studied here are isomorphic to either a tQCP in a DIII class topological superconductor with a protecting $T$-symmetry, or its dual, a $T$-symmetry breaking superconducting nodal point phase, and therefore form an equivalent class. For a generic $T$-symmetric tQCP along Path a), the conserved-charge operators span a six-dimensional linear space while for a $T$-symmetry breaking gapless state along Path b), c), charge operators typically span a two-dimensional linear space instead. Finally, we pinpoint connections between three spatial dimensional lattice chiral fermion models and gapless real fermions that can naturally appear in superfluids or superconductors studied previously.</p>

Recent development in NV configurations and hydrostatic environments have raised the operational pressures of NV centers to 140 GPa2,6,10,11, but substantial challenges remain in extending sensing capabilities into multi-megabar range, critical for research in hydrogen-rich superconductors like La-Sc-H ($T_{\text{c}}$ of 271-298 K at 195-266 GPa)12 and evolution of minerals near Earth's core13. Here we report the fabrication of shallow NV centers through ion implantation followed by high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) annealing, leading to increased density, improved coherence, and mitigated internal stresses, a pre-requisite for reducing their degradation under compression.

            <h2>Witnessing Short- and Long-Range Nonstabilizerness via the Information Lattice</h2>

            <p>We study nonstabilizerness on the information lattice, and demonstrate that noninteger local information directly indicates nonstabilizerness. For states with a clear separation of short- and large-scale information, noninteger total information at large scales $\Gamma$ serves as a witness of long-range nonstabilizerness. We propose a folding procedure to separate the global and edge-to-edge contributions to $\Gamma$. As an example we show that the ferromagnetic ground state of the spin-1/2 three-state Potts model has long-range nonstabilizerness originating from global correlations, while the paramagnetic ground state has at most short-range nonstabilizerness.</p>

            <h2>Approximate quantum error correction, eigenstate thermalization and the chaos bound</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shozab Qasim, Jason Pollack</p>
            <p>Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely independently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we establish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy of time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.</p>

            <h2>A tractable thermodynamic framework linking the condensed ground state to displacive ferroelectric phase transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> F. Yang, L. Q. Chen</p>
            <p>Quantitative description of finite-temperature properties of displacive ferroelectrics, and in particular the critical behavior, is of fundamental importance to both theory and device design, going beyond the Landau-Ginzburg approach, which requires known knowledge of critical behaviors and temperature-dependent parameter fitting. Here within quantum statistic description of quasiparticles, we develop a self-consistent, microscopically based phase-transition framework, by concerning the bosonic condensation of the unstable phonons and treating the emerging collective vectorial polar mode. It enables one to use only the ground-state properties to predict the finite-temperature properties and in particular, the criticality of phase transitions of displacive ferroelectricity. Its applications to the classical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$, quantum paraelectrics SrTiO$_3$ and KTaO$_3$, and recently fabricated ferroelectric strained SrTiO$_3$, demonstrate remarkable quantitative agreements with the experimentally measured dielectric/ferroelectric properties throughout the entire temperature ranges of the phases, including the critical behaviors of phase transitions. The framework provides a tractable basis to understand and quantitatively describe a wide range of phase transitions across ferroelectric systems under different thermodynamic or external conditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Elina Gilbert, Christophe Poulard, Anniina Salonen</p>
            <p>Understanding a material's dissipative response is important for their use in many applications, such as adhesion or fracture resistance. In dispersions, the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials. In conjugation with superposition methods, they allow to better capture the behavior of materials of complex rheology. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition in the continuous-phase-dominated region. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, independently of the frequency, whereas the elastic response is almost unchanged.</p>

            <p>The search for fractional quantized Hall phases in the absence of a magnetic field has primarily targeted flat-band systems that mimic the features of a Landau level. In an alternative approach, the fractional excitonic insulator (FEI) has been proposed as a correlated electron-hole fluid that arises near a band inversion between bands of different angular momentum with strong interactions. It remains an interesting challenge to find Hamiltonians with realistic interactions that stabilize this state. Here, we describe composite boson and composite fermion theories that highlight the importance of $(p_x+ip_y)^m$ excitonic pairing in stabilizing FEIs in a class of band inversion models. We predict a sequence of Jain-like and Laughlin-like FEI states, the simplest of which has the topological order of the bosonic $\nu=1/2$ fractional quantized Hall state. We discuss implications for recent numerical studies on a chiral spin liquid phase in interacting Chern insulator models.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arvin Gopal Subramaniam, Sagarika Adhikary, Rajesh Singh</p>
            <p>Coherent collective motion is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Here, we report a flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the global polar order are excluded volume repulsions and long-ranged repulsive torques. This mechanism requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically respond to chemical gradients, or equivalently, pair colloids sliding together a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating away from each other. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. Furthermore, liquid flocks are observed for a range of chemo-attractive inter-particle forces. Various properties of these two distinct flocking phases are contrasted and discussed. We complement these results with stability analysis of a hydrodynamic model, which admits the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state observed in particle-based simulations.</p>

            <p>High magnetic field and low temperature transport is carried out in order to characterize the charge carriers of $\text{PtSe}_2$. In particular, the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations arising at applied magnetic field strengths $\gtrsim 4.5\,\text{T}$ are found to occur exclusively in plane and emerge at a layer thickness of $\approx 18\,\text{nm}$, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency for thinner $\text{PtSe}_2$ flakes. Moreover, the quantum transport time, Berry phase, Dingle temperature and cyclotron mass of the charge carriers are ascertained. The emergence of weak antilocalization (WAL) lies in contrast to the presence of magnetic moments from Pt vacancies. An explanation is provided on how WAL and the Kondo effect can be observed within the same material. Detailed information about the charge carriers and transport phenomena in $\text{PtSe}_2$ is obtained, which is relevant for the design of prospective spintronic and orbitronic devices and for the realization of orbital Hall effect-based architectures.</p>

Focusing on the many-body ground state, we analyze how the interactions between the impurity and the other components influence the system's structure. For fixed interaction strengths within the mixture, we identify a critical interaction strength with the impurity for which the system undergoes a structural transition characterized by a substantial change in its spatial features. We explore this transition from the point of view of correlations and ground-state susceptibility. We remarkably find that this transition exhibits unique universality features not previously observed in other systems, highlighting novel many-body properties existing in multi-component fermionic mixtures.</p>

            <p>Recent experimental evidence suggests the presence of an unconventional, nodal surface-su\-per\-con\-duc\-ting state in trigonal PtBi\textsubscript{2}. We construct a Ginzburg--Landau theory for the three superconducting order parameters, which correspond to the three irreducible representations of the point group $C_{3v}$. The irreducible representations $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the most likely. We develop a systematic method to determine the symmetry-allowed terms and apply it to derive all terms up to fourth order in the three order parameters. The Ginzburg--Landau functional also includes coupling to the magnetic field. The functional is employed to determine the effect of an applied uniform magnetic field on the nodal structure for $A_1$ and $A_2$ pairing. The results facilitate clear-cut experimental differentiation between these symmetries. We also predict field-induced helical superconductivity.</p>

            <p>We demonstrate a pump-probe strobe light spectroscopy for sensitive detection of magneto-optical dynamics in the context of hybrid magnonics. The technique uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate, corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle. Our results show that time-dependent strobe light measurement of magnetization dynamics can be achieved in the gigahertz frequency range under a pump-probe detection scheme.</p>

This momentum distribution is uniquely given by the rapidities, or quasi-momenta, of the initial trapped state.

            <p>The exceptional tunability of two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers unique opportunities for exploring novel superconducting phases. However, in such systems, the measurement of superfluid phase stiffness, a fundamental property of a superconductor, is challenging because of the mesoscopic sample size. Here, we introduce a contact-free technique for probing the electrodynamic response, and thereby the phase stiffness, of atomically thin superconductors using on-chip superconducting microwave resonators. We demonstrate this technique on 4Hb-TaS$_2$, a van der Waals superconductor whose gap structure under broken mirror symmetry is under debate. In our cleanest few-layer device, we observe a superconducting critical temperature comparable to that of the bulk. The temperature evolution of the phase stiffness features nodeless behavior in the presence of broken mirror symmetry, inconsistent with the scenario of nodal surface superconductivity. With minimal fabrication requirements, our technique enables microwave measurements across wide ranges of two-dimensional superconductors.</p>

Pairs of same sign vortices repel. Spiral vortex dynamics are obtained for same-sign pairs in the presence of a finite axial magnetization. We quantify the dynamics for a range of realistic experimental parameters, finding that the vortex dynamics are accelerated with increasing quadratic Zeeman energy, consistent with existing studies in planar systems.</p>

These results are supported by numerical calculations of the density-density correlation in the quench dynamics for $N=2,3,4,$ and $6$.</p>

            <p>Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin: Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.</p>

            <p>We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the "essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of "ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprates.</p>

            <p>Spin-splitting induced in a conventional superconductor weakens superconductivity by destroying spin-singlet and creating spin-triplet Cooper pairs. We demonstrate theoretically that such an effect is also caused by an adjacent compensated antiferromagnet, which yields no net spin-splitting. We find that the antiferromagnet produces Néel triplet Cooper pairs, whose pairing amplitude oscillates rapidly in space similar to the antiferromagnet's spin. The emergence of these unconventional Cooper pairs reduces the singlet pairs' amplitude, thereby lowering the superconducting critical temperature. We develop a quasiclassical Green's functions description of the system employing a two-sublattice framework. It successfully captures the rapid oscillations in the Cooper pairs' amplitude at the lattice spacing scale as well as their smooth variation on the larger coherence length scale. Employing the theoretical framework thus developed, we investigate this Néel proximity effect in a superconductor/antiferromagnet bilayer as a function of interfacial exchange, disorder, and chemical potential, finding rich physics. Our findings also offer insights into experiments which have found a larger than expected suppression of superconductivity by an adjacent antiferromagnet.</p>

Here we investigate the topological phase transition driven by disorder in a semi-magnetic structure of topological insulator, and narrow-gap weak topological insulator film. We demonstrate that strong disorder not only leads to a topological transition from the parity anomalous semimetal to a diffusive metal with non-quantized anomalous Hall conductance, but also induces the topological phase in a trivial insulating phase. Our calculations of the local density of states provide clear picture for the formation of a single gapless Dirac fermion, which emerges as the disorder strength increases. The half quantized Hall effect is attributed to the existence of the gapless Dirac cone. Our findings of disorder-induced parity anomalous semimetal and diffusive metal significantly advance our understanding of the disorder-driven topological phase transition in magnetic topological insulators, opening up new avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akihiro Hokkyo, Mizuki Yamaguchi, Yuuya Chiba</p>
            <p>We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that, within this class, the only integrable systems are those that have been solved by the Bethe ansatz method, and that all other systems are nonintegrable, in the sense that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. Here, "nontrivial" excludes quantities like the Hamiltonian or the total magnetization, and "local" refers to sums of operators that act only on sites within a finite distance. This result establishes the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and, consequently, demonstrates that the quantum many-body scars observed in this model emerge independently of any conservation laws of local quantities. Furthermore, we extend the proof of nonintegrability to more general spin-1 models that encompass anisotropic extensions of the bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian, and completely classify the integrability of generic Hamiltonians that possess translational symmetry, $U(1)$ symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and spin-flip symmetry. Our result accomplishes a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</p>

            <p>Quantum materials combining magnetism and topological fermions are a key platform for low-energy electronics, spintronics, and quantum phases that break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Coupling a topological insulator to a magnetic material allows proximity magnetization with the potential to achieve these phases at elevated temperatures. One potential architecture for realizing QAHE at elevated temperature is a heterostructure comprising two single-septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with four-quintuple layer (4QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle. However, the origin of this gap has not yet been explicitly determined, as there are other non-magnetic mechanisms that have been shown to produce bandgaps in similar systems. Here, through spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, the magnetic nature of the gap opening is investigated to demonstrates direct control of the spin state via small magnetic fields and confirm the magnetic origin of the gap through spin splitting and broken TRS. Furthermore, the hallmark chiral spin texture of non-magnetic topological insulators is preserved away from the {\Gamma}-point, despite the large 72+/-10 meV exchange gap at the Dirac point. The robust magnetic gap and controllable spin texture hold significant promise for future technologies requiring both magnetic properties and topological protection.</p>

            <p>We study the impact of an external alignment field on the structure formation and polarization behavior of low-density dipolar active particles in three dimensions. Performing extensive Brownian dynamics simulations, we characterize the interplay between long-range dipolar interactions, field alignment, and self-propulsion. We find that the competition between activity (favoring bond breaking) and the field's orientational constraint (promoting bond formation) gives rise to a rich variety of self-assembled, actuated structures. At low to intermediate field strengths, disordered fluids composed of active chains and active percolated networks can emerge, whereas strong fields drive the formation of polarized columnar clusters. Counterintuitively, low activity levels significantly extend the range of field strengths over which percolated networks persist. This structural evolution manifests in the polarization response of strongly dipolar systems, which exhibit a transition from super-Langevin to sub-Langevin behavior with increasing activity, as a result of the coupling between structure formation and activity-induced bond breaking.</p>

            <p>Accurate prediction of shallow-donor electron binding energies is critical for device modeling, dopant activation, and donor-based quantum technologies. Traditional beyond-DFT approaches (e.g., hybrid functionals, GW) are prohibitively expensive for the large supercells needed to capture the extended, hydrogenic wavefunctions, while semi-local DFT underestimates band gaps and suffers from delocalization errors. We present a simple, practical protocol for shallow donors based on the DFT-1/2 approximate quasiparticle correction that maintains the computational cost of standard DFT and enables supercells up to thousands of atoms. This approach provides a straightforward and reproducible workflow that delivers reliable donor binding energies with minimal computational overhead. Applied to group-V donors in Si, Si:X (X= P, As, Sb, Bi), the method yields binding energies in close agreement with experiment. We found that, for Si:Bi, it is essential to include spin-orbit coupling to achieve near-experimental values with a difference of only $\sim$ 4 meV. For arsenic, the method yields excellent agreement with experiment, with a difference of only ~0.3 meV. For antimony, the results match experiment to within ~5 meV, and for phosphorus, the deviation is within ~8 meV. Beyond its high accuracy, DFT-1/2 offers a significant practical advantage, providing a straightforward, reproducible, and transferable workflow that is less demanding than hybrid functional approaches while remaining fully generalizable to other shallow impurities in semiconductors.</p>

            <p>We report dielectric and magnetoelectric studies of single-crystalline \ce{CeMgAl11O19}, a Kramers triangular magnet embedded in a polarizable hexaaluminate lattice. In zero magnetic field, the permittivity $\varepsilon'(T)$ follows the Barrett law of a quantum paraelectric down to 25 K, below which a broad minimum develops near 3 K without evidence of static ferroelectric or magnetic order. Application of magnetic fields up to \SI{9}{\tesla} shifts this minimum to higher temperatures and broadens it, evidencing a tunable magnetoelectric this http URL magnetoelectric coupling was characterized using results from magnetization measurements. The anomaly temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\varepsilon'(T)$, exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric systems. This magnetoelectric effect, mediated by spin-orbit-entangled Kramers doublets interacting with a frustrated antipolar liquid, establishes \ce{CeMgAl11O19} as a prototype for exploring quantum magnetoelectricity in frustrated systems.</p>

            <h2>Yamaji effect in models of underdoped cuprates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing-Yu Zhao, Shubhayu Chatterjee, Subir Sachdev, Ya-Hui Zhang</p>
            <p>Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Chan et al., Nature Physics https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. The results from the $\text{FL}^*$ phase show good consistency with current experimental data. Conversely, the results for the SDW phase are highly sensitive to the ordering momentum along the $z$-direction. An ordering vector of $Q = (\pi, \pi, \pi)$ yields predictions that starkly disagree with the experiment. The only possibility for agreement within the SDW scenario is to assume an ordering momentum of $Q = (\pi, \pi, 0)$. However, even in this specific case, the SDW scenario predicts a marginally smaller Yamaji angle at $\phi=0$ than the FL* theory, and a second Yamaji peak near in-plane angle $\phi = 45^\circ$, which was not observed in the experiment. In reality, the Néel ordering vector is likely uncorrelated between adjacent layers, so that there is no coherent interlayer transport of hole-pocket quasiparticles in the SDW scenario, and consequently no Yamaji effect. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.</p>

            <h2>Distinct Types of Parent Hamiltonians for Quantum States: Insights from the $W$ State as a Quantum Many-Body Scar</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Gioia, Sanjay Moudgalya, Olexei I. Motrunich</p>
            <p>The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.</p>

            <h2>Surface Binding Energies for Amorphous Plagioclase Feldspar Calculated using Molecular Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Amanda Ricketts, Benjamin A. Clouter-Gergen, Anastasis Georgiou, Deborah Berhanu, Liam S. Morrissey</p>
            <p>Despite the well-established presence of amorphous compounds on planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mercury due to space weathering, the direct effect of atomic arrangement on the surface binding energies (SBEs) of elements on these bodies remains largely unexplored. Accurate SBE values are essential for reliably predicting sputtering yields and the energy distribution of ejecta. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify SBEs for the different elements sputtered from amorphous atomic arrangements of the plagioclase feldspar end members, albite and anorthite, and compare to their crystalline counterparts. Results show that while the mean elemental SBEs from amorphous surfaces are not significantly different from their crystalline counterparts, the random orientation in amorphous structures gives rise to a spectrum of bonding configurations, resulting in a distribution of SBEs with a wider range. This contrasts with the clearly discretized set of SBE values associated with the ordered atomic structure of crystalline surfaces. We then consider sputtering by H, He, and a solar wind combination of 96% H and 4% He. For each of these cases, we demonstrate that there is minimal difference (<10% for albite and <20% for anorthite) between the sputtering yields of amorphous and crystalline surfaces. We attribute these results to the presence of the same elemental bonds across different atomic arrangements, which leads to similar mean SBEs and, consequently, comparable sputtering yields.</p>

            <h2>Free-Fermion Measurement-Induced Volume- to Area-Law Entanglement Transition in the Presence of Fermion Interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew S. Foster, Haoyu Guo, Chao-Ming Jian, Andreas W. W. Ludwig</p>
            <p>At a generic volume- to area-law entanglement transition in a many-body system, quantum chaos is arrested. We argue that this tends to imply the vanishing of a certain "mass" term in the field theory of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) for monitored, interacting fermions. To explore this idea, we consider the MIPT with no conserved quantities that describes 1D monitored, interacting Majorana fermions in class DIII. We conjecture that the MIPT is the noninteracting DIII one in this case; the volume-law phase arises through the dangerously irrelevant mass. We propose numerical tests of our conjecture and analytically identify a candidate noninteracting critical point.</p>

            <p>We investigate the impact of two-level systems (TLSs) on superconductivity, treating them as soft modes localised in real space. We show that these defects can either enhance or suppress the superconducting critical temperature, depending on their surface density and average frequency. Using thin-film aluminium as a case study, we quantitatively describe how TLSs modify both the critical temperature and the zero-temperature superconducting gap. Our results thus highlight new opportunities for tailoring material properties through TLS engineering.</p>

            <p>Recent theoretical advances have highlighted the role of Bloch state intrinsic properties in enabling unconventional electro-optic (EO) phenomena in bulk metals, offering novel strategies for dynamic optical control in quantum materials. Here, we identify an alternative EO mechanism in bulk metallic systems that arises from the interplay between Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons. Focusing on twisted double-bilayer graphene (TDBG), we show that the enhanced intrinsic properties of moiré Bloch bands give rise to a sizable linear magnetoelectric EO response, a first-order, electric-field-induced non-Hermitian correction to the gyrotropic magnetic susceptibility. This mechanism dominates in $C_{3z}$-symmetric TDBG, where EO contributions originating from the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) are symmetry-forbidden. Our calculations reveal giant, gate-tunable linear and circular dichroism in the terahertz regime, establishing a robust and tunable platform for ultrafast EO modulation in two-dimensional materials beyond the BCD paradigm.</p>

            <p>The ability to modulate the photoluminescence (PL) of nanomaterials via spin-related effects is vital for many emerging quantum technologies, with nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging being particular areas of focus. Carbon-based quantum dots (CQDs) are among the most common forms of luminescent nanomaterials, appealing due to their ease of synthesis, tunability through organic chemistry, high brightness, and natural biocompatibility. However, the observation of room temperature, spin-dependent PL has remained elusive. Here we report on the observation of PL modulation of CQDs by magnetic fields ($\sim 10$ mT) under ambient conditions. We synthesize a series of CQDs using 19 different amino acids, which have a range of PL emission spectra and exhibit a clear magneto-PL effect (up to $\sim 1$% change). Furthermore, an electron spin resonance is detected in the PL with a g-factor of g $\approx$ 2, suggesting a process similar to the radical pair mechanism is responsible. Finally, we show that the magneto-PL contrast decreases in the presence of paramagnetic species, which we attribute to an increase in magnetic noise-induced spin relaxation in the CQDs. Our work brings new functionalities to these commonly used and biocompatible luminescent nanoparticles, opening new opportunities for in situ quantum sensing and imaging of biological samples.</p>

            <p>We predict the realization of ultrastrong coupling between magnons of antiferromagnets and photons in superconductor/antiferromagnet/superconductor heterostructures at terahertz frequencies, from both quantum and classical perspectives. The hybridization of the two magnon modes with photons strongly depends on the applied magnetic field: at zero magnetic field, only a single antiferromagnetic mode with a lower frequency couples to the photon, forming a magnon-polariton, while using a magnetic field activates coupling for both antiferromagnetic modes. The coupling between magnon and photon is ultrastrong with the coupling constant $\sim$ 100 GHz exceeding 10% of the antiferromagnetic resonant frequency. The superconductor modulates the spin of the resulting magnon-polaritons and the group velocity, achieving values amounting to several tenths of the speed of light, which promises strong tunability of magnon transport in antiferromagnets by superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Signatures of superconducting pairing driven by electron-electron interactions in moiré WSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ homobilayer modelled by Hubbard Hamiltonian</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrzej Biborski, Michał Zegrodnik</p>
            <p>Strong evidence of unconventional superconductivity has been very recently reported experimentally in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and gathered a significant amount of interest. Here we consider the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice describing the hole-doped moiré superlattice emerging in WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer in the moderately correlated regime. By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$. We also identify the emerging superconducting orders, which are $d_{xy}(d_{x^2-y^2} \pm id_{xy} )$ and $p_y(p_{x}\mp ip_{y})$ for the singlet and triplet channels in the cylinder of width three(four), respectively.</p>

            <h2>Quantum geometric magnetic monopole and two-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kosuke Nogaki, Youichi Yanase</p>
            <p>Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory plus Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$) studies revealed that a heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ exhibits van Hove singularities and the Dirac point near the Fermi level $E_{\mathrm F}$, which are key signatures of strong-correlation effects and quantum geometry. We have constructed a two-dimensional 12-orbital \textit{Dirac-Anderson} model as an effective model for CeRh$_2$As$_2$. The band structure and Fermi-surface topology of the Dirac-Anderson model agree well with the ARPES data and the DFT+$U$ calculations. We show that the quantum geometry strongly favors magnetic-monopole fluctuations because of the Dirac point at the $M$ point. By solving the linearized Éliashberg equation, we demonstrate that the $B_{1u}$ and $B_{2g}$ representations, spin-triplet states originating from the Dirac point, exhibit the leading superconducting instabilities. By comparing the random-phase approximation and the fluctuation-exchange approximation, we further demonstrate that strong-correlation effects mitigate the influence of quantum geometry. The phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ under pressure is discussed in connection with the theoretical results.</p>

            <h2>Strong quantum interaction between excitons bound by cavity photon exchange</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Miguel S. Oliveira, Cristiano Ciuti</p>
            <p>We theoretically predict the interaction between polaritonic excitations arising from the coupling of a cavity photon mode with bound to continuum intersubband transitions in a doped quantum well. The resulting exciton bound by photon exchange, recently demonstrated experimentally, exhibits a binding energy that can be continuously tuned by varying the cavity frequency. We show that polariton-polariton interactions, originating from both Coulomb interactions and Pauli blocking, can be dramatically enhanced by reducing the exciton binding energy, thereby increasing the effective Bohr radius along the growth direction. This regime is reminiscent of Rydberg atoms, where weak binding leads to strong quantum interactions. Our predictions indicate that this physics can give rise to giant quantum optical nonlinearities in the mid and far infrared, a spectral region that remains largely unexplored in quantum optics and offers exciting opportunities for both fundamental studies and applications.</p>

            <h2>Majorana zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: Defining topology in short and disordered nanowires through Majorana splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haining Pan, Sankar Das Sarma</p>
            <p>Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap topological excitations at the ends of a 1D topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their individual localization lengths, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite length of the 1D wire considerably complicate the situation, leading to ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of disorder, wire length, and other system parameters in realistic models of nanowires currently being used experimentally. We find that the exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms. A general consequence of our work is that `topology' in finite disordered wires may not be uniquely defined, necessitating a careful analysis which depends on the context.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julian A. Lawn, Nicholas S. Davis, Daniel S. Kosov</p>
            <p>We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases, electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions, establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability under electronic current.</p>

            <h2>Krylov exponents and power spectra for maximal quantum chaos: an EFT approach</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Saskia Demulder, Maria Knysh, Andrew Rolph</p>
            <p>We examine the effective field theory (EFT) of maximal chaos through the lens of Krylov complexity and the Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis. We test the relationship between two measures of quantum chaos: out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) and Krylov complexity. In the EFT, a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic modes enforces the maximal Lyapunov exponent in OTOCs, $\lambda_L = 2\pi T$, while simultaneously constraining thermal two-point autocorrelators. We solve these constraints on the autocorrelator, and calculate the Lanczos coefficients and Krylov exponents for several examples, finding both $\lambda_K = \lambda_L$ and $\lambda_K = \lambda_L/2$. This demonstrates that, within the EFT, the shift symmetry alone is insufficient to enforce maximal Krylov exponents even when the Lyapunov exponent is maximal. In particular, this result suggests a tension with the conjectured bound $\lambda_L \leq \lambda_K \leq 2\pi T$. Finally, we identify autocorrelator solutions whose power spectra closely resemble the so-called thermal product formula seen in holographic systems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sobin Alosious, Fiach Antaw, Matt Trau, Shern R. Tee, Debra J. Searles</p>
            <p>This study investigates the molecular-level mechanism of Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic (AC-EHD) flow in nanopores under high-frequency conditions, using molecular dynamics simulations. A gold-NaCl system with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations is used to analyze the flow patterns under high-frequency AC potentials. Our findings reveal localized heat generation near the electrode leading to a steep temperature gradient. An order parameter analysis explained that the heat generation is due to the periodic change in the alignment of water molecules under AC potential and that at these high frequencies the influence of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions are negligible. The heat generation and temperature gradient are found to increase with the applied AC frequency. Three different electrode configurations were studied by varying the size and distance between the electrodes. A net directional flow develops in the asymmetric electrode structures. A possible mechanism for this is proposed by analyzing the flow patterns using velocity and temperature profiles, order parameters, streamline plots and mean square displacements. Different forces acting on the fluid were identified such as buoyancy-driven convection due to temperature gradient, electrothermal effects influenced by the temperature-dependent properties of water, and Maxwell stress due to the non-uniform electric field. Moreover, the asymmetric electrode structure created an imbalance in these forces and generated a net directional flow. These findings suggest the existence of a form of nanoscale AC-EHD flow that operates in a frequency regime above that of conventional electroosmotic and electrothermal mechanisms and that, unlike these mechanisms, occurs independently of ionic concentration. Thereby this work provides insights for optimizing AC-EHD flow in nanoscale systems where precise fluid manipulation is critical.</p>

            <p>Lanthanum hydride has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its signatures of superconductivity at around 250 K (1, 2). However, the megabar pressures required for synthesize and maintain its state present extraordinary challenges for experiments, particularly in characterizing its Meissner effect (3, 4). The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a promising quantum probe to address this problem (5-8), but a gap remains between its working pressure and the pressure required to study the superconducting state of lanthanum hydride (9-12). In this work, using neon gas as the pressure transmitting medium, the working pressure of NV centers is extended to nearly 200 GPa. This quantum probe is then applied to study the Meissner effect of a LaH$_{9.6}$ sample, synthesized by laser heating ammonia borane and lanthanum. A strong magnetic shielding effect is observed, with the transition temperature beginning at around 180 K and completing at 220 K. In addition, magnetic field imaging after field cooling reveals strong flux trapping and significant inhomogeneities within the sample. Our work provides compelling evidence for superconductivity in lanthanum hydride and highlights the importance of spatially resolved techniques in characterizing samples under ultrahigh pressure conditions.</p>

            <p>Skyrmions are emergent many-body excitations that lie at the heart of both multi-component quantum Hall-like systems and deconfined quantum criticality. In a companion article (X. Wang et al., arXiv:2507.22971), we studied a microscopic time-reversal symmetric model of tunable interacting Chern bands using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and presented evidence for the emergence of robust skyrmion excitations. These charged excitations emerge in the vicinity of a many-body insulator at a commensurate filling of the Chern bands, and lead to the onset of superconductivity when doped away from the insulating phase. Here, we present quantum Monte-Carlo results and a complementary field-theoretical analysis for the quantum phase transition(s) that arise between the intertwined phases as a function of two distinct tuning parameters. Our numerical results are consistent with a single continuous quantum phase transition between an insulating Chern antiferromagnet and a fully gapped superconductor, with an emergent SO(5) symmetry at the putative critical point, highly suggestive of deconfined quantum (pseudo-)criticality. We also present a detailed comparison between the momentum-resolved spectral functions associated with the neutral collective modes, single electron and composite spin-polaron excitations obtained using a combination of Monte-Carlo computations and a Bethe-Salpeter analysis built on top of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation. We end with a brief outlook on some of the interesting open problems.</p>

            <p>Controlling topological phases is a central goal in quantum materials and related fields, enabling applications such as robust transport and programmable edge states. Here we uncover a mechanism in which local on-site impurities act as knobs to decompose global topological properties in discrete steps. In non-Hermitian lattices with spectral winding topology, we show that each impurity sequentially reduces the winding number by one, which is directly manifested as a stepwise decomposition of quantized plateaus in the steady-state response. Based on this principle, we further develop a scheme that sequentially induces topological edge states under impurity control, in a class of Hermitian topological systems constructed by doubling the non-Hermitian ones. Our findings reveal a general scheme to tune global topological properties with local perturbations, establishing a universal framework for impurity-controlled topological phases and offering a foundation for future exploration of reconfigurable topological phenomena across diverse physical platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Avinash Sah, Ting-Yong Lim, Clayton Conner, Amarnath Chakraborty, Giovanni Vignale, Tay-Rong Chang, Pavlo Sukhachov, Guang Bian</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic (AM) compounds have recently emerged as a promising platform for realizing unconventional quantum phases, enabled by their unique spin-split band structure at zero net magnetization. Here, we present a first-principles investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta; and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the development of topological and spintronic applications.</p>

            <h2>Highly Tunable Phonon Polaritons via Metal Intercalation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mariia Stepanova, Minh Ngo, Mashnoon Alam Sakib, Wills Harris, Joshua Bocanegra, Ruqian Wu, Kristie J. Koski, Maxim R. Shcherbakov</p>
            <p>Phonon polaritons in van der Waals crystals offer mid-infrared light confinement deep below the diffraction limit, making them promising for nanophotonics applications. However, the practical use of phonon polaritons remains limited, in part due to the lack of precise control over the phonon polariton dispersion, as crystal lattice vibrations are often inert to external stimuli. Here, we address this challenge by zerovalent metal intercalation of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Photo-induced force microscopy shows that introducing tin into the van der Waals gap modulates the phonon polariton dispersion by up to $38.5\pm0.5\%$, which is the highest amount of tunability among non-mechanical modulation approaches, to the best of our knowledge. Intercalation with various metal species preserves the phonon polariton lifetimes, while modulating the dielectric permittivity in agreement with the density functional theory and analytical calculations. Our results establish metal intercalation as a practical route to reconfigurable mid-infrared nanophotonics.</p>

            <p>Spins in solid-state materials, molecules, and other chemical systems have the potential to impact the fields of quantum sensing, communication, simulation, and computing. In particular, color centers in diamond, such as negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) and silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$), are emerging as quantum platforms poised for transition to commercial devices. A key enabler stems from the semiconductor-like platform that can be tailored at the time of growth. The large growth parameter space makes it challenging to use intuition to optimize growth conditions for quantum performance. In this paper, we use supervised machine learning to train regression models using different synthesis parameters in over 100 quantum diamond samples. We train models to optimize NV$^-$ defects in diamond for high sensitivity magnetometry. Importantly, we utilize a magnetic-field sensitivity figure of merit (FOM) for NV magnetometry and use Bayesian optimization to identify critical growth parameters that lead to a 300% improvement over an average sample and a 55% improvement over the previous champion sample. Furthermore, using Shapley importance rankings, we gain new physical insights into the most impactful growth and post-processing parameters, namely electron irradiation dose, diamond seed depth relative to the plasma, seed miscut angle, and reactor nitrogen concentration. As various quantum devices can have significantly different material requirements, advanced growth techniques such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) can provide the ability to tailor material development specifically for quantum applications.</p>

            <h2>Reinforcement learning-guided optimization of critical current in high-temperature superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mouyang Cheng, Qiwei Wan, Bowen Yu, Eunbi Rha, Michael J Landry, Mingda Li</p>
            <p>High-temperature superconductors are essential for next-generation energy and quantum technologies, yet their performance is often limited by the critical current density ($J_c$), which is strongly influenced by microstructural defects. Optimizing $J_c$ through defect engineering is challenging due to the complex interplay of defect type, density, and spatial correlation. Here we present an integrated workflow that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations to autonomously identify optimal defect configurations that maximize $J_c$. In our framework, TDGL simulations generate current-voltage characteristics to evaluate $J_c$, which serves as the reward signal that guides the RL agent to iteratively refine defect configurations. We find that the agent discovers optimal defect densities and correlations in two-dimensional thin-film geometries, enhancing vortex pinning and $J_c$ relative to the pristine thin-film, approaching 60\% of theoretical depairing limit with up to 15-fold enhancement compared to random initialization. This RL-driven approach provides a scalable strategy for defect engineering, with broad implications for advancing HTS applications in fusion magnets, particle accelerators, and other high-field technologies.</p>

            <h2>Magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zefei Han, Haojin Wang, Yuanchang Li</p>
            <p>Much is known about the magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic insulators, yet little is understood about multiferroic metals. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to identify the sliding van der Waals bilayer $1T$-NbTe$_2$ as a multiferroic metal, where in-plane metallicity coexists with out-of-plane polarization and magnetism. It exhibits linear magnetoelectric response, originating from direct spin-charge interactions as a result of external field-modulated Fermi energy, which differs from the spin-charge-lattice or spin-orbit coupling mechanisms in multiferroic insulators. We derive a universal formula for magnetoelectric coupling parameters of multiferroic metals, which highlights the crucial role of interlayer dielectric permittivity in enhancing performance. Our work provides insights for exploring magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms and designing functional materials with strong magnetoelectric coupling.</p>

            <p>We report a light-driven non-equilibrium vortex Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a superconductor. We use a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to demonstrate vortex-antivortex deconfinement via light induced fields. The transformation occurs independently of thermal fluctuations and is viewed as a quantum phase transition. The resulting phase map mirrors QCD phase diagram, delineating confined, premelted, and fully deconfined vortex phases. The nature of these phases is discussed. Transitions between phases are governed by light induced depairing and phase fluctuations, establishing a new class of light-induced topological transitions.</p>

            <h2>Normal Dirac Semimetal Phase and Zeeman-Induced Topological Fermi Arc in PtSr5</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Inkyou Lee, Churlhi Lyi, Youngkuk Kim</p>
            <p>Pt-Sr binary intermetallics encompass a broad range of stoichiometries and crystal structures, stabilized by complex bonding and multivalent chemistry. The Sr-rich end member, PtSr5, is recently identified via artificial-intelligence-guided materials design as a body-centered tetragonal compound (I4/m). Using first-principles calculations, we show that PtSr5 hosts a Dirac semimetal phase with trivial Z2 topology, classified as a normal Dirac semimetal. A symmetry-indicator analysis based on parity eigenvalues at the eight time-reversal-invariant momenta confirms that all Z2 invariants-evaluated on time-reversal-invariant two-dimensional subspaces of momentum space with a direct band gap-are trivial, thereby establishing the topologically trivial nature of the Dirac semimetal phase. Nonetheless, our calculations reveal that applying an external Zeeman magnetic field along the z-axis drives the system into a Weyl semimetal phase, as corroborated by characteristic changes in the computed surface states. This work demonstrates the tunability of topological phases in PtSr5 via external perturbations and highlights the effectiveness of AI-based materials exploration in discovering new quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Switching between Skyrmions and Yoshimori Spin Spirals via Li Absorption in Janus Magnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyuan Jiang, Jian Wu, Weiyi Pan</p>
            <p>Chiral magnetic textures have attracted considerable attention owing to their topological properties and potential applications in spintronic devices. Here, we employ first-principles calculations together with atomic spin dynamics simulations to explore the switching between skyrmions and Yoshimori-type spin spirals induced by Li adsorption in Janus two-dimensional (2D) CrTeSe. We show that selective Li adsorption on either the Se- or Te-terminated surface stabilizes distinct magnetic phases: Li adsorption on the Se side favors a Yoshimori-type spin spiral, whereas adsorption on the Te side stabilizes the skyrmionic state. This contrast originates from site-dependent modifications of exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy (MA), and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In addition, the response of magnetic textures to out-of-plane magnetic fields differs strongly between the two systems. These results demonstrate that surface adsorption provides an effective strategy for reversible control of chiral magnetic states in 2D magnets, while also offering fundamental insights into the competing interactions that govern the stability of skyrmions and Yoshimori spin spirals. Our findings highlight the potential of Janus 2D materials as a versatile platform for engineering tunable spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>A theoretical study of a number of properties of A2CrH6 (where A = Ba, Sr, and Ca) hydride perovskites with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP). These include structural, hydrogen storage, mechanical, phonon, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties. The lattice constants of the compounds studied are in the range from 7.220 Å to 8.082 Å, and they exhibit stable cubic crystal structures. Negative formation energies, elastic constants, phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations testify to their thermodynamic, mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability, respectively. For the perovskite hydrides Ba2CrH6, Sr2CrH6 and Ca2CrH6, the corresponding specific hydrogen storage capacities are 1.82 wt.%, 2.69 wt.%, and 4.37 wt.%, respectively. Among these compounds, Sr2CrH6 exhibits the lowest applicable hydrogen desorption temperature, at 463.7 K. The electronic bands show remarkable spin activity, demonstrating that the change of A2+ cation (where A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) immediately influences the spin polarization and electronic behavior of hydride perovskites. On the basis of the elastic moduli studied, the mechanical behavior determines that Ca2CrH6 is the strongest material. The present results highlight the potential of A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) perovskite hydrides, in particular Ca2CrH6, for applications in advanced energy systems and hydrogen storage, as well as for electrical and optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>AQCat25: Unlocking spin-aware, high-fidelity machine learning potentials for heterogeneous catalysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Omar Allam, Brook Wander, Aayush R. Singh</p>
            <p>Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear optical quantum theory of demagnetization in L1$_0$ FePt and FePd</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> G. P. Zhang, Y. H. Bai, Thomas F. George</p>
            <p>It is now well established that a laser pulse can demagnetize a ferromagnet. However, for a long time, it has not had an analytic theory because it falls into neither nonlinear optics (NLO) nor magnetism. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing a nonlinear optical theory centered on the spin moment, instead of the more popular susceptibility. We first employ group theory to pin down the lowest order of the nonzero spin moment in a centrosymmetric system to be the second order, where the second-order density matrix contains four terms of sum frequency generation (SFG) and four terms of difference frequency generation (DFG). By tracing over the product of the density matrix and the spin matrix, we are now able to compute the light-induced spin moment. We apply our theory to FePt and FePd, two most popular magnetic recording materials with identical crystal and electronic structures. We find that the theory can clearly distinguish the difference between those two similar systems. Specifically, we show that FePt has a stronger light-induced spin moment than FePd, in agreement with our real-time ultrafast demagnetization simulation and the experimental results. Among all the possible NLO processes, DFGs produce the largest spin moment change, a manifestation of optical rectification. Our research lays a solid theoretical foundation for femtomagnetism, so the light-induced spin moment reduction can now be computed and compared among different systems, without time-consuming real-time calculations, representing a significant step forward.</p>

            <p>The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of layered, two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moiré physics with stacks of twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than in 2D van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after obvious issues of contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In hybrid interfaces between a chemically inert 2D material and an oxide membrane, the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. In all these material systems, the interface morphology is best characterized using cross-sectional imaging and is necessary to corroborate investigations of interlayer coupling. When imaging the bicrystal in projection, conventional through-focal imaging is found to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography reliably resolves structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasizes the need for reliable characterization methods.</p>

            <p>Proper treatment of the many-body interactions is of paramount importance in our understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here we investigate the effects of particle-hole fluctuations on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in two-dimensional Fermi gases throughout the entire BCS-BEC crossover. We include self-consistently in the self energy treatment the entire particle-hole $T$ matrix, which constitutes a renormalization of the bare interaction that appears in the particle-particle scattering $T$ matrix, leading to a screening of the pairing interaction and hence a dramatic reduction of the pairing gap and the transition temperature. The BKT transition temperature $T_\text{BKT}$ is determined by the critical phase space density, for which the pair density and pair mass are determined using a pairing fluctuation theory, which accommodates self-consistently the important self-energy feedback in the treatment of finite-momentum pairing fluctuations. The screening strength varies continuously from its maximum in the BCS limit to essentially zero in BEC limit. In the unitary regime, it leads to an interaction-dependent shift of $T_\text{BKT}$ towards the BEC regime. This shift is crucial in an attempt to explain experimental data quantitatively, which often depends on the interaction strength. Our findings are consistent with available experimental results in the unitary and BEC regimes and with quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the BCS and unitary regimes.</p>

            <p>Developing high-energy-density batteries is essential for advancing sustainable energy technologies. However, leading cathode materials such as Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern, demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80% delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network.</p>

            <p>Argyrodite-type Ag-based sulfides combine exceptionally low lattice thermal and high ionic conductivity, making them promising candidates for thermoelectric and solid-state energy applications. In this work, we studied Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) argyrodite family by combining chemical-bonding analysis, lattice vibrational properties simulation, and experimental measurements to investigate their structural and thermal transport properties. Furthermore, we propose a two-channel lattice-dynamics model based on Grüneisen-derived phonon lifetimes and compare it to an approach using machine-learned interatomic potentials. Both approaches are able to predict thermal conductivity in agreement with experimental lattice thermal conductivities along the whole temperature range, highlighting their potential suitability for future high-throughput predictions. Our findings also reveal a relationship between bond heterogeneity arising from weakly bonded Ag+ ions and occupied antibonding states in Ag-S and Ag-Ag interactions and strong anharmonicity, including large Grüneisen parameters, and low sound velocities, which are responsible for the low lattice thermal conductivity of Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6, and Ag8SiS6. We furthermore show that thermal and ionic conductivities in all three compounds are independent of each other and can likely be tuned individually.</p>

High temperature operation could in principle be offered using cuprate superconductors. However, the complexity of the material in thin film form, the extremely short coherence length and material stability, have hindered the realization of THz devices working at liquid nitrogen temperatures. $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\delta}}$ (YBCO) nanodevices have demonstrated non-linear properties typical of Josephson-like behavior, which have the potential for the mixing of AC signals in the THz range due to the large superconducting energy gap. Here, we present AC Josephson functionalities for terahertz waves utilizing Abrikosov vortex motion in nanoscale-confined fully planar YBCO thin film bridges. We observe Shapiro step-like features in the current voltage characteristics when irradiating the device with monochromatic sub-THz waves (100 GHz to 215 GHz) at 77 K.

            <p>Understanding the emergence of novel collective behaviors in strongly interacting systems lies at the heart of quantum many-body physics. Valuable insight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body systems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example is the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a wide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this Letter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of quantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a completely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the operator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic behavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure factor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time correlators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on matrix product states. Our results could be readily tested in state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems.</p>

            <p>High-dimensional random landscapes underlie phenomena as diverse as glassy physics and optimization in machine learning, and even their simplest toy models already display extraordinarily rich behavior. This thesis aims to deepen our understanding of that behavior, by combining landscape-based approaches, via the Kac-Rice formalism, with dynamical approaches, paying special attention to both systems with reciprocal and with non-reciprocal interactions. After surveying core techniques and results through the spherical p-spin model, this thesis delivers three main advances: (i) exact dynamic-static comparison in a solvable class of models with non-reciprocal interactions, pinpointing differences and similarities of the two approaches; (ii) a stability-based calculation of the mean number of fixed points (i.e., annealed complexity) of the Sompolinsky-Crisanti-Sommers random neural network, for any level of non-reciprocity; (iii) two approaches to probe the barriers and the distribution of deep local minima in the landscape of the p-spin model; (iv) some results on the overlaps among eigenvectors of spiked, correlated random matrices, which are useful to explore the geometry of energy landscapes. Together, these results sharpen our understanding of these systems, while providing new tools and opening new doors for future research directions.</p>

            <p>Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.</p>

            <h2>Low-temperature scaling laws in unconventional flat-band superconductors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Buthenhoff, Yusuke Nishida</p>
            <p>In flat-band superconductors, the electron pairing is strongly enhanced so that the critical temperature scales linearly with the interaction strength. Identifying the governing pairing mechanism in flat-band superconducting systems is therefore a central task, which may be constrained by experimental probes via low-temperature scaling measurements. A key observable underlying the Meissner effect and the resulting divergent DC conductivity is the superfluid weight. While it is well established that the minimal quantum metric provides the dominant contribution to the superfluid weight in conventional superconductors with isolated flat bands, recent studies indicate that the unconventional pairing can generate additional nonlocal quantum geometric terms. This motivates us to derive the low-temperature scaling law of the superfluid weight in two-dimensional flat-band superconductors with sufficiently isolated bands. In particular, we consider the gap function with point or line nodes classified by the Weierstrass preparation theorem. Beyond the superfluid weight, we additionally deliver explicit low-temperature scaling laws of the order parameter, the tunneling conductance, the specific heat, the Sommerfeld coefficient, and the spin-lattice relaxation rate to provide complementary experimental discriminants of the underlying pairing symmetry. The implications of our results are also elucidated by applying them to a selection of superconducting states in $C_{6v}$-symmetric systems.</p>

            <p>Discovering materials with previously unreported crystal frameworks is key to achieving transformative functionality. Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable means to propose candidate crystal structures, however existing approaches mainly reproduce decorated variants of established motifs rather than uncover new configurations. Here we develop a physics-informed diffusion method, supported by chemically grounded validation protocol, which embeds descriptors of compactness and local environment diversity to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across architectures, increasing the fraction of structures outside 100 most common prototypes up to 67%. When crystal structure prediction (CSP) is seeded with generative structures, most candidates (97%) are reconstructed by CSP, yielding 145 (66%) low-energy frameworks not matching any known prototypes. These results show that while generative models are not substitutes for CSP, their chemically informed, diversity-guided outputs can enhance CSP efficiency, establishing a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration of chemical space.</p>

            <h2>Rabi oscillations of a monolayer quantum emitter driven through its excited state</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor N. Mitryakhin, Ivan A. Solovev, Alexander Steinhoff, Jaewon Lee, Martin Esmann, Ana Predojević, Christopher Gies, Christian Schneider</p>
            <p>The interaction of a quantum two-level system with a resonant driving field results in the emergence of Rabi oscillations, which are the hallmark of a controlled manipulation of a quantum state on the Bloch sphere. This all-optical coherent control of solid-state two-level systems is crucial for quantum applications. In this work we study Rabi oscillations emerging in a WSe2 monolayer-based quantum dot. The emitter is driven coherently using picosecond laser pulses to a higher-energy state, while photoluminescence is probed from the ground state. The theoretical treatment based on a three-level exciton model reveals the population transfer between the exciton ground and excited states coupled by Coulomb interaction. Our calculations demonstrate that the resulting exciton ground state population can be controlled by varying driving pulse area and detuning which is evidenced by the experimental data. Our results pave the way towards the coherent control of quantum emitters in atomically thin semiconductors, a crucial ingredient for monolayer-based high-performance, on-demand single photon sources.</p>

            <h2>A platform for zero-field isolated skyrmions: 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers on Re(0001)</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moinak Ghosh, Stefan Heinze, Souvik Paul</p>
            <p>Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with atomistic spin simulations, we explore the possibility of realizing zero-field isolated skyrmions in three 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers -- Rh/Co, Pd/Co, and Ru/Co -- grown on the Re(0001) surface. Our investigation employs an extended atomistic spin model, which goes beyond the standard model by including the multi-spin higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) in addition to the Heisenberg pairwise exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). All magnetic interactions of the extended spin model are calculated using DFT. The phase diagram obtained from atomistic spin simulations based on this spin model for Rh/Co and Pd/Co on Re(0001) reveals that isolated skyrmions emerge spontaneously on the ferromagnetic background even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The radius of zero-field isolated skyrmions in Rh/Co/Re(0001) is around 6 nm, whereas the radius of those skyrmions in Pd/Co/Re(0001) is about 12 nm. Transition-state theory calculations show that the skyrmions are protected by substantial energy barriers, approximately 150 meV, which predominantly arise from DMI, with a small contribution from the HOI interactions. The height of the barriers suggests that skyrmions could be observed in low-temperature experiments. Based on this work, we propose 4$d$/Co bilayers on Re(0001) as a new platform to realize nanoscale zero-field isolated skyrmions.</p>

            <p>Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer unique advantages for next-generation batteries, but their rational design is hindered by an unclear structure-property relationship. This study establishes universal design principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B, Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing high-performance amorphous SSEs.</p>

            <p>Nowadays a bit is no longer a mere abstraction but a physical quantity whose manipulation governs both operation of modern technologies and theoretical frontiers of fundamental science. In this work we propose a setup in which the memory time can be utilized to control the generation and storage of binary information. In particular, we consider a nonequilibrium Brownian particle immersed in a viscoelastic environment and dwelling in a spatially periodic potential. We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending on the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be either in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic state in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We analyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of the produced values. Our study provides a blueprint for storing and processing information in a microscopic system using its memory.</p>

            <p>Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</p>

            <h2>Estimating applied potentials in cold atom lattice simulators</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bhavik Kumar, Daniel Malz</p>
            <p>Cold atoms in optical lattices are a versatile and highly controllable platform for quantum simulation, capable of realizing a broad family of Hubbard models, and allowing site-resolved readout via quantum gas microscopes. In principle, arbitrary site-dependent potentials can also be implemented; however, since lattice spacings are typically below the diffraction limit, precisely applying and calibrating these potentials remains challenging. Here, we propose a simple and efficient experimental protocol that can be used to measure any potential with high precision. The key ingredient in our protocol is the ability in some atomic species to turn off interactions using a Feshbach resonance, which makes the evolution easy to compute. Given this, we demonstrate that collecting snapshots from the time evolution of a known, easily prepared initial state is sufficient to accurately estimate the potential. Our protocol is robust to state preparation errors and uncertainty in the hopping rate. This paves the way toward precision quantum simulation with arbitrary potentials.</p>

            <h2>Effectiveness of cardinality-return weighted maximum independent set approach for financial portfolio optimization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keita Takahashi, Tetsuro Abe, Yasuhito Nakamura, Ryo Hidaka, Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka</p>
            <p>The portfolio optimization problem is a critical issue in asset management and has long been studied. Markowitz's mean-variance model has fundamental limitations, such as the assumption of a normal distribution for returns and sensitivity to estimation errors in input parameters. In this research, we propose a novel graph theory-based approach, the cardinality-return weighted maximum independent set (CR-WMIS) model, to overcome these limitations. The CR-WMIS model pursues the optimization of both return and risk characteristics. It integrates the risk diversification effect by selecting the largest number of weakly correlated stocks, a feature of the maximum independent set (MIS) model, with the weighting effect based on expected returns from the weighted maximum independent set (WMIS) model. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through a five-year backtesting simulation (April 2019 - March 2024) using real market data from the S&P 500. For this task, we employed a simulated-bifurcation-based solver for finding high-quality solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. In our evaluation, we conducted a comprehensive risk assessment, which has not been sufficiently explored in previous MIS and WMIS studies. The results demonstrate that the CR-WMIS model exhibits superiority in both return and risk characteristics compared to the conventional MIS and WMIS models, as well as the market index (S&P 500). This study provides a practical portfolio optimization method that overcomes the theoretical limitations of the mean-variance model, contributing to both the advancement of academic theory and the support of practical investment decision-making.</p>

However, applying user-defined electrostatic potentials in DFT is nontrivial and often requires direct modification to the specific DFT code. In this work, we present an implementation for supercell DFT calculations under arbitrary electric fields and discuss the required corrections to the energies and forces. The implementation is realized through the recently released VASP-Python interface, enabling the application of user-defined fields directly within the standard VASP software and providing great flexibility and control. We demonstrate the application of this approach with diverse case studies, including molecular adsorption on electrified surfaces, field ion microscopy, electrochemical solid-water interfaces, and implicit solvent models.</p>

            <p>The strain states of the components of pseudomorphic superlattices can be accurately modeled analytically through the application of linear elasticity. In this particular case of GaN/AlN 'free-standing' superlattices, the predictions derived from elastic modeling have been compared with total energy calculations of several systems made of components with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate that the elastic predictions for the lattice constants of the components align with the values obtained from their total energy counterparts, within the limits of computational errors and uncertainties. Furthermore, a phenomenological analysis of the elastic energy stored in the superlattices facilitates the evaluation of the excess energies associated with the interfaces present in these systems. The results mentioned above are briefly contrasted with findings reported in previous literature.</p>

            <p>Using stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo method and density matrix renormalization group, we study the ground-state phase diagram of $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on 2D square-hexagon-octagon (SHO) lattice. In this model, we consider two kinds of nearest-neighbor interaction (intra-hexagon interaction $J_1$ and inter-hexagon $J_2$) and the selected third nearest-neighbor interaction $J_3$ along $x$ direction. From our calculations, there are five phases in the parameters regime $0<\lambda_1=J_2/J_1<4, 0<\lambda_2=J_3/J_1<4$, including a Néel antiferromagentic phase, a Haldane-like symmetry protected topological phase, a hexagon phase and two dimer phases. In the Haldane-like SPT phase, we characterized its topological nature using the degeneracy of ground-state energy under open boundary condition and the entanglement spectrum. To characterize the phase boundaries, we use spin stiffness and Binder cumulant to do the comprehensive finite-size scalings. From data collapse, the critical behaviors of all the nonmagnetic phases to the antiferromagnetic phase belong to the 3D $O(3)$ Heisenberg universality class. As a theoretical exploration, our work establishes a foundational framework for understanding 2D magnetism on the SHO lattice.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tobias Dannegger, Imre Hagymási, Levente Rózsa, Ulrich Nowak</p>
            <p>Magnetic phase transitions between ordered phases are often understood on the basis of semi-classical spin models. Deviations from the classical description due to the quantum nature of the atomic spins as well as quantum fluctuations are usually treated as negligible if long-range order is preserved, and are rarely quantified for actual materials. Here, we demonstrate that a fully quantum-mechanical framework is required for a quantitatively correct description of the spin-flop transition in the insulating altermagnet hematite between the collinear antiferromagnetic and the weakly ferromagnetic spin-flop phase at low temperature. By applying both exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group theory to the quantum Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we show how a quantum-mechanical treatment of an ab initio parametrized spin model can significantly improve the predicted low-temperature spin-flop field over a classical description when compared to measurements. Our results imply that quantum fluctuations have a measurable influence on selecting the ground state of a system out of competing ordered magnetic phases at low temperature.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fredrik Hasselgren, Max O. Al-Hasso, Amy Searle, Joseph Tindall, Marko von der Leyen</p>
            <p>Spin glass systems as lattices of disordered magnets with random interactions have important implications within the theory of magnetization and applications to a wide-range of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Nevertheless, despite sustained efforts, algorithms that attain both high accuracy and efficiency remain elusive. Due to their topologies being low-$k$-partite such systems are well suited to a probabilistic computing (PC) approach using probabilistic bits (P-bits). Here we present complex spin glass topologies solved on a simulated PC realization of an Ising machine. First, we considered a number of three dimensional Edwards-Anderson cubic spin-glasses randomly generated as well as found in the literature as a benchmark. Second, biclique topologies were identified as a likely candidate for a comparative advantage compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, with a range of sizes simulated. We find that the number of iterations necessary to find solutions of a given quality has constant scaling with system size past a saturation point if one assumes perfect parallelization of the hardware. Therefore a PC architecture can trade the computational depth of other methods for parallelized width by connecting a number of P-bits that scales linearly in system size. This constant scaling is shown to persist across a number of solution qualities, up to a certain limit beyond which resource constraints limited further investigation. The saturation point varies between topologies and qualities and becomes exponentially hard in the limit of finding the ground truth. Furthermore we demonstrate that our PC architecture can solve spin-glass topologies to the same quality as the most advanced quantum annealer in minutes, making modest assumptions about their implementation on hardware.</p>

            <h2>Interrelation between precisions on integrated currents and on recurrence times in Markov jump processes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alberto Garilli, Diego Frezzato</p>
            <p>For Markov jump processes on irreducible networks with finite number of sites, we derive a general and explicit expression of the squared coefficient of variation for the net number of transitions from one site to a connected site in a given time window of observation (i.e., an `integrated current' as dynamical output). Such expression, which in itself is particularly useful for numerical calculations, is then elaborated to obtain the interrelation with the precision on the intrinsic timing of the recurrences of the forward and backward transitions. In biochemical ambits, such as enzyme catalysis and molecular motors, the precision on the timing is quantified by the so-called randomness parameter and the above connection is established in the long time limit of monitoring and for an irreversible site-site transition; the present extension to finite time and reversibility adds a new dimension. Some kinetic and thermodynamic inequalities are also derived.</p>

            <p>Harnessing non-Markovian effects has emerged as a resource for quantum control, where a structured environment can act as a quantum memory. We investigate the quench dynamics from specific initial states to equilibrium steady states in strongly correlated quantum dot systems. The distance between quantum states is quantified using the Bures metric, which endows the space of reduced density matrices with a Riemannian geometric structure. Using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we demonstrate a quantum Mpemba effect arising from non-Markovianity. This effect is characterized by a relaxation slowdown due to information backflow from the bath to the system, which induces a pronounced memory effect. We show that the emergence of the non-Markovian quantum Mpemba effect on the approach to a strongly correlated steady state is determined by the interplay between the initial-state-dependent non-Markovianity and the initial geometric distance between states. Our results underscore the critical role of memory effects in quantum quench dynamics and suggest new pathways for controlling anomalous relaxation in open quantum systems.</p>

            <p>We perform an ab initio computational investigation of the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of one of the best performance half-Heusler (HH) alloys, NbFeSb. We use Boltzmann Transport equation while taking into account the full energy/momentum/band dependence of all relevant electronic scattering rates, i.e. with acoustic phonons, non-polar optical phonons (intra- and inter-valley), polar optical phonons (POP), and ionized impurity scattering (IIS). We use a highly efficient and accurate computational approach, where the scattering rates are derived using only a few ab initio extracted matrix elements, while we account fully for intra-/inter valley/band transitions, screening from both electrons and holes, and bipolar transport effects. Our computed thermoelectric power-factor (PF) values show good agreement with experiments across densities and temperatures, while they indicate the upper limit of PF performance for this material. We show that the polar optical phonon and ionized impurity scattering (importantly including screening), influence significantly the transport properties, whereas the computationally expensive non-polar phonon scattering part (acoustic and non-polar optical) is somewhat weaker, especially for electrons, and at lower to intermediate temperatures. This insight is relevant in the study of half-Heusler and other polar thermoelectric materials in general. Although we use NbFeSb as an example, the method we employ is material agnostic and can be broadly applied efficiently for electronic and thermoelectric materials in general, with more than 10x reduction in computational cost compared to fully ab initio methods, while retaining ab-initio accuracy.</p>

            <p>The study of complex many-body systems through the analysis of the trajectories of dynamically moving and interacting units is a non-trivial task. The workflow for extracting meaningful information from raw trajectory data typically involves several interconnected steps: (i) identifying and tracking objects, and resolving their trajectories (for example, in experimental systems where these are not automatically available as in molecular simulations); (ii) translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle and analyze using suitable descriptors; and (iii) extracting meaningful information from these data. Each of these tasks often requires substantial programming skills, the use of different types of representations or methods, and the development of interfaces between them. Despite the progress made by new tools targeting individual steps, integrating them under a common framework would lower the barrier to use (especially for diverse communities of users), reduce fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in trajectory data analysis. To this end, we introduce dynsight, an open Python platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from simulation or experimentally resolved trajectories. Dynsight simplifies workflows, enhances accessibility, and supports the analysis of time-series and trajectory data to unravel the dynamic complexity of systems across different scales.

The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</p>

            <p>Memristors are emerging as key electronic components that retain resistance states without power. Their non-volatile nature and ability to mimic synaptic behavior make them ideal for next-generation memory technologies and neuromorphic computing systems inspired by the human brain. In this study, we present a novel organic spintronic memristor based on a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Co heterostructure, exhibiting biologically inspired synaptic behavior. Driven by fluorine atom migration within the PVDF layer, the device demonstrates both long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) under controlled electrical polarization. Distinctively, the resistance states can also be modulated by an external magnetic field via the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, introducing a non-electrical means of tuning synaptic plasticity. This magnetic control mechanism enables multi-state modulation without compromising device performance or endurance. Furthermore, convolutional neural network (CNN) simulations incorporating this magnetic tuning capability reveal enhanced pattern recognition accuracy and improved training stability, especially at high learning rates. These findings underscore the potential of organic spintronic memristors as high-performance, low-power neuromorphic elements, particularly suited for applications in flexible and wearable electronics.</p>

            <p>In binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates, massive-vortex dipoles can arise, and undergo scattering processes against obstacles. These show an intriguing dynamics, governed by the strongly nonlinear character of the quantum vortex motion, where we are able to highlight the effects of the boundaries. We first characterize such scattering dynamics via some point-like models, for the cases of an unbounded plane and a confined geometry. Within this framework, we find two fundamental scattering behaviors of a vortex dipole, the "fly-by" and the "go-around" processes. By plotting the deflection angle of the dipole versus the impact parameter we are able to quantify the transition between different scattering behaviors. We then are able to introduce an analytical distinction of the two scenarios, basing on the point-like model for the plane geometry. Furthermore, another interesting result shows the emergence of an on-average massless dynamics whenever the nonlinear interactions with the obstacle become negligible. Alongside, we investigate the quantum dipole scattering via the numerical simulation of two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, describing the quantum mixture at a mean-field level. In this way, we benchmark the point-like model against the mean-field simulations.</p>

Later, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1 chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1 nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover, we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). This work paves the way for the experimental realization of these topological phases, which can be locally probed with scanning tunneling microscopy.</p>

            <h2>Potential-based formalism for electrodynamics of media with weak spatial dispersion</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yury Solyaev</p>
            <p>In this work, we develop a potential-based formalism for Maxwell's equations in isotropic media with weak spatial dispersion within the electric quadrupole-magnetic dipole approximation. We introduce an operator form of the constitutive relations along with a modified Lorenz gauge condition, which enables the derivation of decoupled generalized wave equations for electromagnetic potentials. For time-harmonic processes, we derive the representation of general solution for these equations as a combination of solutions to Helmholtz-type equations, whose parameters are determined by both standard and hyper-susceptibilities of the medium. We show that the proposed approach can be extended to more general constitutive relations and it provides a convenient framework for solving various applied problems. Specifically, using a derived closed-form solution for the problem of plane wave incidence on a planar interface, we demonstrate that a correct definition of the Poynting vector within the multipole theory must incorporate quadrupole effects -- an aspect overlooked in some previous works that has led to inconsistent results. We further establish the necessity of accounting for both propagated and evanescent longitudinal components in reflected and transmitted waves. The presence of these components, which follow directly from the general solution for electromagnetic potentials, is essential for satisfying all classical and additional boundary conditions in media with quadrupolar response (e.g., in metamaterials or quadrupolar liquid mixtures). The complete set of these boundary conditions is derived based on the least action principle, ensuring variational consistency with the field equations and generalizing previously known formulations of multipole theory.</p>

            <h2>High-Efficiency Thermoelectric Transport in Aharonov-Bohm-Casher Rings</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diego García, Sergio Arias, Rosa López</p>
            <p>Quantum heat engines are nanoscale devices that convert heat into work by exploiting quantum effects, such as coherence and interference. Previous studies of these devices did not consider spin-dependent effects, which can influence the thermoelectric performance of the engine. In this work, we study the thermoelectric behavior of a quantum heat engine based on an Aharonov-Bohm ring - a mesoscopic ring where electrons exhibit interference depending on the magnetic flux it encloses - incorporating Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI), which couples the electron's motion and spin. We find that Rashba SOI enhances the figure of merit $ZT$, measure of the engine's conversion efficiency. Our results suggest that controlling spin-dependent interference could lead to improvements in the fabrication of efficient thermoelectric devices.</p>

            <p>The emergence of order in many-body systems and the associated self-similar dynamics governed by dynamical scaling laws is a hallmark of universality far from equilibrium. Measuring and classifying such nontrivial behavior for novel symmetry classes remains challenging. Here, we realize a well-controlled interlayer coupling quench in a tunable bilayer two-dimensional Bose gas, driving the system to an ordered phase. We observe robust self-similar dynamics and a universal critical exponent consistent with diffusion-like coarsening, driven by vortex and antivortex annihilation induced by the interlayer coupling. Our results extend the understanding of universal dynamics in many-body systems and provide a robust foundation for quantitative tests of nonequilibrium effective field theories.</p>

            <h2>Solution to a Quantum Impurity Model for Moiré Systems: Fermi Liquid, Pairing, and Pseudogap</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Jie Wang, Geng-Dong Zhou, Hyunsung Jung, Seongyeon Youn, Seung-Sup B. Lee, Zhi-Da Song</p>
            <p>Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals. This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential, pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$, $J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S>J_D$) or a valley doublet ($J_D>J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when $J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet (local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG calculations.</p>

            <h2>Statistics of correlations in nonlinear recurrent neural networks</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> German Mato, Facundo Rigatuso, Gonzalo Torroba</p>
            <p>The statistics of correlations are central quantities characterizing the collective dynamics of recurrent neural networks. We derive exact expressions for the statistics of correlations of nonlinear recurrent networks in the limit of a large number N of neurons, including systematic 1/N corrections. Our approach uses a path-integral representation of the network's stochastic dynamics, which reduces the description to a few collective variables and enables efficient computation. This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results with excellent agreement.</p>

The theory, experimental concept and implementation are described in detail. The non-zero nuclear electric dipole moment measured with over 1000 hours of data was that of $^{181}$Ta producing a best value $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm0.31_\text{stat})\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}$ and $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm3.18)\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}>0$ at 99.985\%CL. There is an uncertainty on the value of overall multiplicative parameters such as the self-inductance of the superconducting circuit ($\pm4\%$), the mutual inductance between the SQUID pickup coil and the sample wire ($\pm15\%$), and the magnitude of the solenoid current ($\pm5\%$). An upper-limit was estimated for the control element, $^{207}$Pb, $|d_\text{e}^\text{Pb}|\lesssim1.2\cdot10^{-31}e\cdot\text{cm}$ at 95\%CL.</p>

            <h2>Tuning laser-induced optical breakdown and cavitation through the ionic environment in aqueous media</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Junhao Cai, Yuhan Li, Yunqiao Liu, Benlong Wang, Mingbo Li</p>
            <p>Laser-induced cavitation in liquids originates from optical breakdown processes that depend sensitively on both laser-plasma dynamics and the chemical microenvironment of the solvent. Herein, we experimentally decouple the effects of ionic strength and ion specificity on cavitation inception in aqueous electrolytes spanning neutral, acidic, and alkaline regimes. Using focused nanosecond laser pulses, we show that increasing ionic strength universally lowers the cavitation threshold by enhancing charge screening and seed-electron availability. However, under constant ionic strength, strongly asymmetric behavior emerges: acidic (hydrogen chloride, HCl) solutions inhibit cavitation, whereas alkaline (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) solutions enhance it. This asymmetry arises from hydrated-electron kinetics that depends on the ion specificity. In acidic solutions, hydronium ions act as diffusion-limited scavengers of hydrated electrons, quenching their lifetime and inhibiting avalanche ionization. In contrast, hydroxide ions reduce hydronium availability and extend electron survival, promoting more efficient plasma formation. Despite large discrepancies in breakdown thresholds, electrical conductivity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that microscopic electron chemistry, rather than bulk charge transport, governs cavitation onset. These results establish a mechanism connection between electrolyte chemistry and optical breakdown, showing that ion-specific reaction dynamics fundamentally control laser-induced cavitation in aqueous environments.</p>

            <p>In many data analyses, each measurement may come with a simple yes/no correction; for example, belonging to one of two populations or being contaminated or not. Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> He-Ran Wang, Ilya Vilkoviskiy, Dmitry A. Abanin</p>
            <p>The influence matrix (IM) provides a powerful framework for characterizing nonequilibrium quantum many-body dynamics by encoding multitime correlations into tensor-network states. Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.</p>

The evolution of quantum states is evaluated via eigenvalue dynamics of a general Hamiltonian system, perturbed by a parametrically evolving variable $\lambda(t)$ that carries the time-dependence. This is achieved using the Pechukas-Yukawa mapping of the evolution of the energy levels governed by their initial conditions on a generalised Calogero-Sutherland model of a 1D classical gas. As such, quantum systems can be described exactly in their entirety from eigenvalue dynamics. Under this description, we provide an improved understanding of the relationship between nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions and decoherence which has significant impacts to a wide range of applications.</p>

            <p>We experimentally demonstrate unconventional linewidth narrowing and strong exciton-photon coupling in a planar hybrid microcavity (MC) with a low quality factor Q of around 300. As the broad photonic resonance approaches the heavy- and light-hole exciton transitions in GaAs quantum wells, three well-separated exciton-polariton branches emerge, accompanied by a counter-intuitive fourfold narrowing of the total linewidth. This behavior challenges conventional two-oscillator strong-coupling models and is only partially reproduced by transfer-matrix and Green's-function calculations, suggesting the involvement of frequency-dependent self-energies or correlated dissipation. Our findings demonstrate that strong coupling and coherence enhancement can occur even in highly lossy cavities, questioning the conventional requirement for high-Q microcavities and opening new design possibilities for polaritonic and photonic devices.</p>

Recent developments in spatial and temporal beam shaping have demonstrated their potential to revolutionize pulsed laser ablation in liquids by enabling more precise energy deposition and modified nanoparticle production dynamics. This review highlights the critical role of beam shaping, encompassing spatial shaping of the beam to influence laser-material interaction, and temporal modification to optimize pulse duration and energy delivery. The current advancements in beam shaping techniques, their impact on the nanoparticle characteristics, and their broader implications for scaling pulsed laser ablation in liquids to meet industrial demands are highlighted, offering a comprehensive perspective on the future of this dynamic field.</p>

            <p>Simulating real-time quantum dynamics in interacting spin systems is a fundamental challenge, where exact diagonalization suffers from exponential Hilbert-space growth and tensor-network methods face entanglement barriers. In this work, we introduce a scalable Pauli propagation approach that evolves local observables directly in the Heisenberg picture. Theoretically, we derive a priori error bounds governed by the Operator Stabilizer Rényi entropy (OSE) $\mathcal{S}^\alpha(O)$, which explicitly links the truncation accuracy to operator complexity and prescribes a suitable Top-$K$ truncation strategy. For the 1D Heisenberg model with $J_z = 0$, we prove the number of non-zero Pauli coefficients scales quadratically in Trotter steps, establishing the compressibility of Heisenberg-evolved operators. Numerically, we validate the framework on XXZ Heisenberg chain benchmarks, showing high accuracy with small $K$ in free regimes ($J_z = 0$) and competitive performance against tensor-network methods (e.g., TDVP) in interacting cases ($J_z = 0.5$). These results establish an observable-centric simulator whose cost is governed by operator complexity rather than entanglement, offering a practical alternative for studying non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <p>In this work, we investigate the influence of torsion, Aharonov-Bohm flux, and external magnetic fields on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a confined quantum system. The confinement potential is not assumed a priori, but emerges as a radial effective potential, analogous to a quantum dot, geometrically induced by the torsion of the material. Starting from an effective radial equation derived in a nontrivial geometric background, we analytically solve for the energy spectrum and wave functions. These solutions are then employed to evaluate the optical absorption coefficients and refractive index changes, including both linear and third-order nonlinear contributions. The formalism incorporates the electric dipole approximation and accounts for intensity-dependent effects such as saturation and spectral shifts. Our results reveal that torsion and topological parameters significantly modify the optical response, leading to tunable resonances and nontrivial dispersive behavior.

            <p>Quantum tunneling allows electrons to be transferred between two regions separated by an energetically forbidden barrier. Performing a position measurement that finds a particle in the barrier forces the tunneling electrons to transition from having a classically forbidden energy to an energy above the barrier height. We exploit this effect to define quantum tunneling engines that can use the unconditioned detection of virtually occupied states as a resource for power generation and cooling. Leveraging energy exchange with the detector, we show that the device can operate in a hybrid regime, enabling simultaneous cooling and power generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate measurement-assisted autonomous refrigeration and "checkpoint" cooling driven purely by a thermal bias, without the need for an applied potential. We also find a "purification-by-noise" effect when the measurement drives the system into a stationary dark state. These results underscore the intriguing dual role of measurement as a thermodynamic resource and a dark state generator.</p>

            <p>Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations were used to study pool boiling of water films on an ultra-thin planar aluminum substrate as well as the effect of surface wettability. The simulation geometry is a 10 nm-thick water film on an FCC aluminum substrate heated from 300 K to 900 K. The first peak acceleration onset time of the film, as the measure of the nucleation start, has been observed. The average heating rates of the near-wall water were 0.064, 0.048, and 0.035 K/ps for hydrophilic, neutral, and hydrophobic surfaces, respectively. Boiling curves shows that the critical heat flux (CHF) equals 5216, 3979, and 2525 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 466, 502, and 561 K, respectively. The minimum heat flux (MHF, Leidenfrost point) is equal to 2157, 2463, and 2366 MW/m^2 at wall temperatures of 767, 784, and 746 K, respectively. Interfacial HTC remains higher for longer times under the hydrophilic condition, whereas Kapitza resistance is low initially but then increases sharply after transition to film boiling with the highest values for the hydrophobic surface. In general, the results demonstrate that engineering aluminum wettability towards intense hydrophilicity diminishes the explosive boiling point, increases CHF, and enhances nanoscale thermal management performance.</p>

            <p>Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties; and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics, energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation, memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery. Code: this https URL</p>

Expanding this evolution in the Krylov space, we find that the $n$-th Krylov basis corresponds to an $n$-error state generated by the decoherence, providing a natural bridge between error proliferation and complexity growth. Using two dephasing quantum channels as concrete examples, we show that the Krylov complexity remains nonsingular for strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SWSSB) crossovers, while it exhibits a singular area-to-volume-law transition for genuine SWSSB phase transitions, intrinsic to mixed states.</p>

            <p>The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory leads to modified gravity equations that reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view to derive the Hamiltonian associated with this theory. Focusing on isotropic spacetimes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of the GfE theory. We reveal that the FRW metrics are associated with $k$-temperature and $k$-pressure which are related to their local Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated for the case of Friedmann universes that are solutions of the GfE equations of motion in the low energy, small curvature limit. We show that while the total GQRE for unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of Friedmann universes is not decreasing in time.</p>

            <p>Carbon nanotube (CNTs) materials, which exhibit intrinsically high electrical conductivity, are promising candidates for energy-efficient electronic devices. Recently, high-density CNT films have also been successfully employed as switching elements in non-volatile memory cells. However, the mechanism of electrical conduction through such complex systems is still poorly understood. To identify structural parameters that govern the electrical current in CNT films, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct dense mesoscale CNT film models, where we considered CNTs with different chiralities and lengths. The effects of CNT geometrical features on the film morphologies were quantified by devising a set of structural descriptors and analyzing their mutual correlations. The impact of varying the concentration of amorphous carbon (aC) inclusions on the film structure was assessed. Finally, we employed a nodal analysis framework to compute the electrical current across the networks and correlate the charge transport characteristics to the underlying structural descriptors. Transport is found to be enhanced in films that exhibit high curvature and buckling, low bundling, and strong connectivity, with amorphous carbon components playing a nontrivial configuration-dependent role. These findings provide a framework for the rational design of CNT-based memristor architectures and highlight the potential of mesoscale modeling to guide the engineering of advanced nanostructured materials.</p>

We demonstrate both numerically and analytically that even with undirected layers, interlayer directionality alone reproduces superdiffusion and the prime regime. We further reveal a new phenomenon, the directionality-induced jamming, whereby directed interlayer links hinder diffusion, fragmenting the system into dynamically disconnected components and preventing convergence to the steady state of the diffusion process. Via an optimization process, we show that this new regime is attainable in both toy models and real-world topologies. These findings underscore the crucial role of interlayer link directionality in shaping the emergent behavior of multiplex systems, with potential implications for the design and control of such systems.</p>

            <h2>Radiation enhanced diffusion in cartilages as a physical mechanism underlying radiation treatments of osteoarthritis and related disorders</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Diana Shvydka, Victor Karpov</p>
            <p>Degradation of joint cartilages can result in osteoarthritis (OA) affecting about 10\% of the US population and responsible for significant hospitalization costs. While observations show that low dose radiation treatments (LDRT) bring improvements for a majority of OA patients, the underlying mechanism is not sufficiently understood. Here, we show how the radiation enhanced diffusion (RED) can boost the molecular transport in cartilages promoting cartilage self-healing rendering a mechanism for the observed positive LDRT effects on OA. Along with quantitative estimates for RED, we predict a related phenomenon of the electric charge build up that allows LDRT schedules promoting desirable types of molecular transports dominated by either positive or negative molecular species. Our analyses call upon further experimental verifications and clinical trials with curative rather than palliative intent. In addition to OA applications, our developed approaches can be useful for sports medicine dealing with damage or degeneration of the articular cartilages.</p>

            <h2>LLM Meets Diffusion: A Hybrid Framework for Crystal Material Generation</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Subhojyoti Khastagir, Kishalay Das, Pawan Goyal, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Niloy Ganguly</p>
            <p>Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities, effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints.

            <p>Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</p>

We provide an explicit example of a system with quantum group global symmetry which is chaotic. The example is a spin chain with next-to-nearest interaction term. We show the chaotic behavior of the system by studying the Eigenvalue statistics. The spin chain is non-unitary but PT-symmetric and, in addition to chaos, exhibits an interesting transition after which the eigenvalues become complex.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marios-Petros Kitsaras, Johannes Tölle, Pierre-François Loos</p>
            <p>The accurate prediction of ionization potentials (IPs) is central to understanding molecular reactivity, redox behavior, and spectroscopic properties. While vertical IPs can be accessed directly from electronic excitations at fixed nuclear geometries, the computation of adiabatic IPs requires nuclear gradients of the ionized states, posing a major theoretical and computational challenge, especially within correlated frameworks. Among the most promising approaches for IP calculations is the many-body Green's function $GW$ method, which provides a balanced compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is applicable to both finite and extended systems. Recent work has established formal connections between $GW$ and coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory, leading to the first derivation of analytic $GW$ nuclear gradients via a unitary CCD framework. In this work, we present an alternative, fully analytic formulation of $GW$ nuclear gradients based on a modified version of the traditional equation-of-motion CCD formalism, enabling the inclusion of missing correlation effects in the traditional CCD methods.</p>

            <p>We investigate the intermolecular interactions between laser-cooled CaF and Ca, in their ground and excited electronic states, aiming to understand atom-exchange reaction pathways. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods, we compute potential energy surfaces for nine electronic states arising from the lowest three asymptotes of Ca$_2$F trimer, within the rigid rotor approximation applied to CaF. Two-dimensional potential energy surfaces are computed for the ground state and one of the excited states. We use a combination of the coupled cluster method restricted to single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, and the multireference configuration interaction method with single and double excitations. The ground (X)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$ electronic state of the trimer is significantly deep and highly anisotropic. The excited electronic states are also strongly bound. Notably, the potential energy surface of one of the excited states, (2)~$^2\mathrm{A}'$, lies below the ground-state asymptote of the trimer. By analyzing the potential energy surfaces, we discuss atom-exchange reaction pathways involving both the ground-state interaction between CaF and Ca and the excited metastable state of Ca.</p>

            <p>We study the genetic interfaces between two species of an expanding colony that consists of individual microorganisms that reproduce and undergo diffusion, both at the frontier and in the interior. Within the bulk of the colony, the genetic interface is controlled in a simple way via interspecies interactions. However, at the frontier of the colony, the genetic interface width saturates at finite values for long times, both for neutral strains and interspecies interactions such as antagonism. This finite width arises from geometric effects: genetic interfaces drift toward local minima at an undulating colony frontier, where a focusing mechanism induced by curvature impedes diffusive mixing. Numerical simulations support a logarithmic dependence of the genetic interface width on the strength of the number fluctuations.</p>

            <p>Porous microstructures, while central to many functional materials, remain difficult to characterize quantitatively by atom probe tomography (APT). Although several strategies have been proposed over the past decade, most remain constrained by significant practical or technical limitations. Here, we introduce an in situ pore filling approach that integrates seamlessly into conventional specimen preparation workflows. The method employs a vacuum compatible resin that is rapidly cured by the electron beam during standard ion beam based preparation, eliminating the need for additional instrumentation or extensive sample handling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a porous SnSe + MXene electrode, a material system otherwise difficult to analyze via APT characterisation. This method offers a robust, accessible solution for extending APT analysis to porous materials</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubham S. Ganar, Deepak J., Arindam Das</p>
            <p>This study investigates the impact of surface functionalization, oil coating, and oil absorption on droplet impact behavior on textured polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) substrates. The textured surfaces were fabricated with square micro-posts having spacings of 5 and 20 microns. The PDMS samples were functionalized with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) to improve water repellency. Following, the surfaces were either coated with or allowed to absorb two different lubricants, silicone oil (SO-5cSt) and hexadecane. We performed detailed wetting measurements on both untreated and OTS-functionalized substrates. These measurements provided useful insights into how water and lubricants were retained and distributed under static conditions. High-speed imaging was used to capture droplet impact across a range of Weber numbers. On SO-5cSt-absorbed substrates, droplets consistently showed complete rebound at all Weber numbers, regardless of post spacing. This robust rebound was attributed to the oil's ability to fill the gaps between the posts through capillary action, while also forming a stable lubricating layer above the texture. This thin oil film reduced friction between the droplet and the surface, enabling the droplet to retain sufficient energy for complete rebound. In contrast, hexadecane-absorbed substrates displayed different dynamics. At low Weber numbers, only partial rebound was observed, while at intermediate values, droplets rebounded completely. However, droplets no longer rebounded at higher Weber numbers and remained deposited. Repeated droplet impacts further demonstrated that hexadecane-infused surfaces gradually lost oil from the textured gaps, resulting in a decline in rebound performance over time. This effect was not observed with SO-5cSt, underscoring the importance of lubricant affinity and stability.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hong-Da Lyu, Jun-Kun Zhao, Li Li</p>
            <p>Recent developments identify pole-skipping as a `smoking-gun' signature of the hydrodynamic nature of chaos, offering an alternative way to probe quantum chaos in addition to the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). We study the quantum chaos and pole-skipping phenomenon in the strongly coupled charged rotating fluids, holographically dual to rotating black holes with nontrivial gauge field. We find that the near-horizon equation governing energy-density fluctuations differs from the source-less shock wave equation determining the OTOC, which depends on the $U(1)$ gauge choice. This discrepancy is eliminated under an appropriate boundary condition on the $U(1)$ gauge potential at the event horizon, as required by the vanishing of Wilson loop at the Euclidean horizon. We further investigate the dependence of the butterfly velocity on the charge and rotation parameters in a specific black hole configuration--the Cvetič-Lü-Pope solution.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Matthew Kiser, Max McGinley, Daniel Malz</p>
            <p>A limitation of analog quantum simulators based on cold atoms in optical lattices is that readout is typically limited to observables diagonal in the charge basis, i.e., densities and density correlation functions. To overcome this limitation, we propose experiment-friendly schemes to measure charge-off-diagonal correlations (such as currents). Our protocols use non-interacting dynamics for random times followed by standard quantum gas microscope measurements to effectively measure in random bases. The main requirement of our scheme is the ability to turn off interactions, which can be done in many atomic species using Feshbach resonances. Importantly, our scheme requires no local control and otherwise also exhibits modest requirements in terms of total evolution time and number of repetitions. We numerically demonstrate efficient estimation of bilinear correlation functions, requiring less than $4000$ samples to measure local currents to 5% error (system-size independent) and $\sim 10^4$ samples to simultaneously measure all non-local correlations in 70-site systems. Due to its simplicity, our protocol is implementable in existing platforms and thus paves the way to precision measurements beyond particle number measurements.</p>

            <h2>A First Experiment at Interfacing Crystal Plasticity and Continuum Dislocation Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Khaled SharafEldin, Peng Lin, Vignesh Vivekanandan, Gustavo M. Castelluccio, Benjamin Anglin, Anter El-Azab</p>
            <p>A computational approach has been developed for the analysis of the properties of 3D dislocation substructures generated by the vector density continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD), within the framework of crystal plasticity. In the CDD framework, the dislocation density on the individual slip systems is represented by vector fields with a unique dislocation line direction at each point in space. The evolution of these density fields is governed by a set of transport-reaction equations coupled with crystal mechanics. This detailed picture of the dislocation system enables mesoscale plasticity simulations based on dislocation properties at the lattice level. In the current work, a computational approach based on streamline construction is proposed to obtain the statistical properties of the dislocation substructures generated by CDD. Streamlines are obtained by travelling along the tangent of the vector density and velocity fields of the dislocation system, which enables us to construct the dislocation lines and their paths in the deformed crystal in 3D. The streamlines are computed by numerical integration of a set of partial differential equations for the parameterized tangent fields. Here, we use this approach to extract microstructure parameters from the CDD simulations that are relevant to substructure-sensitive crystal plasticity models. These parameters include the mean free path and average mobile dislocation segment length, as well as the dislocation wall volume fraction, together with the corresponding distributions. The results show that, past a short initial rise during monotonic loading, both the mobile dislocation segment length and dislocation mean free path decrease with the applied strain, which is consistent with the models used in the crystal plasticity literature.</p>

            <p>In unconventional high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors, the intricate interplay between the non-ergodic bad metal and the strange metal state has remained enigmatic. Herein, we unravel this mystery using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and the temperature-dependent effective potential method. Our investigation, centered on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ , provides the first simulation report on the $B_{1g}$ phonon anomaly, unveiling thermal decoupling induced by the bond weakening between the Ba atom and CuO$_2$ plane. This decoupling emerges as a pivotal underpinning behind several puzzling phenomena in high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our results indicate that the effective temperature on the BaO plane deviates from that of the CuO$_2$ plane at low temperatures. Furthermore, we delineate the correlation between thermal decoupling and the Planckian dissipation, rigorously and quantitatively revealing a connection between linear-$T$ resistivity, Uemura relation, and superconducting domes, which are known to be the most important unsolved mysteries of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The suppressed isotope effect ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ $\approx$ 0.02) in cuprates is also quantitatively explained from thermal decoupling. Our discoveries offer a revolutionary perspective on high-$T_c$ superconductivity, suggesting the potential for a transformative shift in our comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that the autonomous emergence of low-temperature layers within materials has the potential to revolutionize industrial thermal management challenges.</p>

            <p>Understanding how amorphous solids yield under shear is central to predicting material failure, yet prescribing reliable local yielding criteria remains a fundamental challenge. Here, through a mesoscale analysis of localized yielding, we reveal an intrinsic length scale (\zeta) that governs local failure, and demonstrate that \zeta grows with the age of the system. The age dependence shows up not only in the features of the distribution of local yield stress but also in the pseudogap exponent \theta, which provides a measure of marginal stability of the amorphous solids. These insights are made possible by a new method, termed the soft matrix approach, that allows local regions of an amorphous solid to yield within a minimally constrained, elastically coupled environment. By overcoming key limitations of earlier techniques, our approach provides a robust platform for probing failure mechanisms, particularly in soft disordered materials and paves the way for improved elastoplastic modeling of disordered solids.</p>

            <p>Quantum noise is a fundamental probe of quantum transport phenomena, offering insights into current correlations and wave-particle duality. A particularly intriguing form of such noise, $\Delta_T$ noise, emerges under a finite temperature difference in the absence of charge current at zero voltage bias. In this work, we investigate $\Delta_T$ noise in mesoscopic hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, where the average charge current remains zero at zero bias. Using quantum shot noise measurements, we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise in metal-insulator-superconductor (NIS) junctions is approximately $16$ times greater than in metal-insulator-metal (NIN) counterparts. Our analysis further reveals that $\Delta_T$ noise exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on barrier strength, rising to a peak before declining, while increasing monotonically with the applied temperature bias. These findings underscore the rich interplay between thermal gradients and barrier properties in determining quantum noise characteristics in hybrid mesoscopic systems.</p>

            <p>A robust theory of the mechanism of pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity (i.e. where Cooper pairs have nonzero center of mass momentum) remains elusive. Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</p>

            <p>Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Be2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.</p>

Away from half-filling Landau quasiparticles emerge. Charge dynamics show either high-energy bound states or concentration of spectral weight within the continuum for attractive or repulsive interactions, respectively. These universal features are realized across multiple models and energy scales thus reifying the quasi-Fermi liquid as a unique paradigm for one-dimensional fermions.</p>

            <p>Recent advances in moiré engineering motivate the study of lattice models of strongly-correlated electrons subjected to substantial orbital magnetic flux. We analyze the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette and a density of one electron per site, where a chiral spin liquid phase may exist between weak-coupling integer quantum Hall and strong-coupling 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic phases. We use matrix product state methods and analytical arguments to investigate this model compactified to cylinders of finite circumference. We uncover a glide particle-hole symmetry operation which, we argue, is spontaneously broken at the quantum Hall to spin liquid transition on odd-circumference cylinders. We numerically verify the spontaneous symmetry breaking and further demonstrate that this transition is associated with algebraic long-range correlations of various spin-singlet, charge-neutral operators. For even-circumference cylinders, the transition becomes a crossover associated with a large correlation length that grows substantially with circumference. Our findings suggest that in the two-dimensional limit, the transition to a chiral spin liquid phase is continuous and features critical fluctuations of the current.</p>

            <p>We study the effects of an orbital magnetic field on the Mott metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard-Hofstadter model. We demonstrate that sufficiently large magnetic fields induce a Mott insulator-to-metal phase transition supporting our claim with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) numerical results. For both competing phases (metal and insulator) we observe a magnetic-fieldinduced metallization reflected in an enhancement of kinetic and potential energy. The kinetic energy of the Mott insulator increases due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect experienced by electrons virtually tunneling around an elementary plaquette which is, however, suppressed by strong correlations. The kinetic energy of the metallic phase, on the other hand, is more strongly affected by the magnetic field through a field-driven redistribution of spectral weight due to the formation of magnetic minibands. This leads to an increase of the kinetic energy which tends to stabilize the metallic state. Our theoretical results might be relevant for recent experimental studies on magnetic field driven insulator-to-metal transitions in strongly correlated materials such as VO2, $\lambda$-type organic conductors and moiré multilayers.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising platforms for quantum technologies and optoelectronics, with defects playing a crucial role in their properties. We present a comprehensive density functional theory study of silicon and carbon vacancies in monolayer silicon carbide (1L-SiC), a wide-bandgap 2D semiconductor with potential for room-temperature quantum applications. Using PBE, SCAN, r$^2$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals, we reveal distinct characteristics between Si and C vacancies. Formation energies and charge transition levels show strong functional dependence, with HSE06 consistently predicting higher values and deeper transition levels compared to PBE calculations. Electronic structure analysis demonstrates contrasting behavior: silicon vacancies create highly localized states with strong spin polarization, while carbon vacancies produce more dispersed states with weaker magnetic properties. Vacancy migration studies reveal significantly lower barriers for silicon vacancies compared to carbon vacancies, indicating higher mobility for Si vacancies at moderate temperatures. Optical properties, calculated using PBE-DFPT, show distinct charge-state dependent absorption in the far-infrared region, with positively charged states of both vacancy types demonstrating the strongest response. The complementary characteristics of Si and C vacancies - localized versus dispersed states, different magnetic properties, and distinct optical responses - suggest possibilities for defect engineering in quantum and optoelectronic applications. Our results highlight the critical importance of advanced functionals in accurately describing defect properties and provide a comprehensive framework for understanding vacancy behavior in 2D materials.</p>

            <p>Ab initio techniques have revolutionised the way in which theory can help practitioners to explore critical mechanisms that govern reactions or properties, and to develop new strategies for materials discovery and design. Yet, their application to electrochemical systems is still limited, due to the challenges electronic structure calculations face in achieving a realistic description of electrified solid/liquid interfaces including, e.g., potential and pH control or free energies of barrier configurations. A well-known example of how novel concepts can extend the scope of simulations is the development of thermostats, which introduced temperature control to electronic structure Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The analogous technique for modelling electrochemical systems - potential control, inherent to most electrochemical experiments - is just emerging. In this review, we critically discuss state-of-the-art approaches to describe electrified interfaces between a solid electrode and a liquid electrolyte in realistic environments. By exchanging energy, electronic charge and ions with their environment, electrochemical interfaces are thermodynamically open systems. In addition, large fluctuations of the electrostatic potential and field occur on the time and length scales relevant to chemical reactions. We systematically discuss the key challenges in incorporating these features into realistic ab initio simulations, as well as the available techniques and approaches to overcome them, in order to facilitate the development and use of these novel techniques by the wider community. These methodological developments provide researchers with a new level of realism to explore fundamental electrochemical mechanisms and reactions from first principles.</p>

            <p>We probe the spectrum of elementary excitations in SrIrO$_3$ by using heterostructured [(SrIrO$_3$)$_m$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_l$] samples to approach the bulk limit. Our resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements at the Ir $L_3$-edge reveal a robust low-lying collective magnetic mode with an antiferromagnetic (AF) dispersion similar to the insulators Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, albeit with a large gap and much larger linewidth. At higher energies we find the spin-orbit exciton, also strongly broadened, but with an inverted dispersion and doubled periodicity that are controlled by the charge hopping. These results demonstrate that the AF paramagnon persists, somewhat counterintuitively, far into the metallic regime of the insulator-metal transition driven by the degree of confinement in the heterostructure. We conclude that these two excitations, which are contrasting but coexisting hallmarks of strong AF pseudospin and charge fluctuations in a spin-orbit-coupled Mott-Slater material, are properties intrinsic to the ground state of semimetallic perovskite SrIrO$_3$.</p>

            <h2>Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic signaling gradient</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Muhamet Ibrahimi, Matthias Merkel</p>
            <p>A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.</p>

            <h2>Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristina N. Kondrashova, Konstantin S. Kolegov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya</p>
            <p>The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</p>

            <h2>Laser-driven Ultrafast Dynamics of a Fractional Quantum Hall System</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ammar Kirmani, Benedikt Fauseweh, Jian-Xin Zhu</p>
            <p>Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron systems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground states, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations are dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and use a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation. As opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for interactions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By performing exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show the presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is electromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of \emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the overlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the laser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the chiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field can excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.</p>

            <h2>Electronic structure of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Keyu Zeng, Zhan Wang, Kun Jiang, Ziqiang Wang</p>
            <p>The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Cs, Rb) have become a fascinating materials platform following the discovery of many novel quantum states due to the interplay between electronic correlation, topology, and geometry. Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.</p>

            <h2>Superconductivity and pair density waves from nearest-neighbor interactions in frustrated lattice geometries</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eeli O. Lamponen, Sofia K. Pöntys, Päivi Törmä</p>
            <p>We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.</p>

            <h2>From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring quasiperiodic phases in transverse field Ising chains</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Davood Marripour, Jahanfar Abouie</p>
            <p>Time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent a compelling extension of the concept of time crystals (TCs). While TCs break discrete time-translation symmetry by exhibiting a periodic response at a subharmonic of the driving frequency, TQCs display a more complex temporal order. They respond at multiple incommensurate frequencies, values that are not integer multiples of the fundamental driving frequency, resulting in quasiperiodic dynamics. In this work, we investigate the emergence of a TQC in a disordered quantum Ising chain subjected to a quasiperiodic transverse field. Using exact diagonalization, we find that the transverse magnetization exhibits quasiperiodic oscillations which persist over extended prethermal timescales before eventual decay. This indicates that the TQC exists as a long-lived, prethermal dynamical phase rather than a true equilibrium state. We further assess the robustness of this prethermal TQC against interactions and driving imperfections, confirming its stability under realistic experimental conditions. Finite-size analysis reveals that the prethermal TQC lifetime exhibits minimal dependence on system size. Additionally, we explore the emergence of TQCs in the same chain under symmetric sampling of exchange couplings. Our results demonstrate that the TQC phase is highly sensitive to both the choice of coupling distribution and the values of the driving frequencies. These findings highlight promising experimental prospects for realizing TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, providing valuable insights into their stability, dynamical properties, and potential for exploring novel non-equilibrium quantum phases.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas C. Lang, Andreas M. Läuchli</p>
            <p>We perform large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model at half filling with a single Dirac cone close to the critical point, which separates a Dirac semi-metal from an antiferromagnetically ordered phase where SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss the implementation of a single Dirac cone in the SLAC formulation for eight Dirac components and the influence of dynamically induced long-range super-exchange interactions. The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${\nu = 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${\eta_{\phi}=0.73(1)}$ and ${\eta_{\psi}=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rustem Sharipov, Matija Koterle, Sašo Grozdanov, Tomaž Prosen</p>
            <p>Classical cellular automata represent a class of explicit discrete spacetime lattice models in which complex large-scale phenomena emerge from simple deterministic rules. With the goal to uncover different physically distinct classes of ergodic behavior, we perform a systematic study of three-state cellular automata (with a stable `vacuum' state and `particles' with $\pm$ charges). The classification is aided by the automata's different transformation properties under discrete symmetries: charge conjugation, spatial parity and time reversal. In particular, we propose a simple classification that distinguishes between types and levels of ergodic behavior in such system as quantified by the following observables: the mean return time, the number of conserved quantities, and the scaling of correlation functions. In each of the physically distinct classes, we present examples and discuss some of their phenomenology. This includes chaotic or ergodic dynamics, phase-space fragmentation, Ruelle-Pollicott resonances, existence of quasilocal charges, and anomalous transport with a variety of dynamical exponents.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. Alex Rautu, Alexandra Zidovska, David Saintillan, Michael J. Shelley</p>
            <p>The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.</p>

            <p>High density data storage and spin-logic devices require highly efficient all-electric control of spin moments. So far, charge-to-spin conversion through the spin Hall effect (SHE) highly limits to d-orbital materials associated with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), especially heavy metals. However, d-orbital heavy metals with strong SOC results in a short spin diffusion length, which restricts the spin transport and accumulation in spintronic devices. Therefore, it is urgent to discovery new SHE materials with both large spin Hall conductivity and high spin transport ability beyond d-orbital materials. Here, we experimentally report a large charge to spin conversion in a p-orbital In2Bi alloy, exhibiting the coexistence of a large spin Hall angle and a long spin diffusion length (4 times that of Pt). Our first-principles calculations reveal that small gap openings near the Fermi level lead to large Berry curvature-related spin Hall conductivity. Due to the delocalized nature of p-orbitals of In2Bi, its spin current can overcome the physical barriers between spin Hall angle and spin diffusion length in d-orbital metals, thereby advancing the development of high performance spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</p>

            <h2>Anisotropic Spin Ice on a Breathing Pyrochlore Lattice</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gloria Isbrandt, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap</p>
            <p>Spin ice systems represent a prime example of constrained spin systems and exhibit rich low-energy physics. In this study, we explore how introducing a tunable anisotropic spin coupling to the conventional Ising spin ice Hamiltonian on the breathing pyrochlore lattice affects the ground state properties of the system. Significant changes are observed in the ground state structure, reflected in the spin structure factor and in a reduction of residual entropy at low temperatures. We theoretically uncover a rich phase diagram by varying the anisotropy and demonstrate how this modification reduces the ground state degeneracy across different phases. Numerical simulations reveal that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the system either undergoes a crossover into a constrained spin ice manifold, characterized by an entropy density that drops below the Pauling entropy of conventional spin ice, or a phase transition into a symmetry-broken state, depending on the perturbations. Additionally, we compute the spin structure factors for the anisotropic model and compare these results to analytical predictions from a large-$N$ expansion, finding good agreement. This work develops the understanding of spin ice in anisotropic limits, which may be experimentally realized by strain, providing, among others, key signatures in entropy and specific heat.</p>

We find that it is remarkably similar to the factored vision transformer, which has been employed successfully for several frustrated spin systems, allowing us to relate this architecture to more conventional convolutional networks. Through a series of numerical experiments we design the ConvNext to achieve greatest performance at lowest computational cost, then apply this network to the Shastry-Sutherland and J1-J2 models, obtaining variational energies comparable to the state of the art, providing a blueprint for network design choices of translationally-symmetric architectures to tackle challenging ground-state problems in frustrated magnetism.</p>

            <p>We investigate the long-term relaxation of a distribution of $N$ point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics. To focus on the regime of weak collective amplification, we embed these point vortices within a static background potential and soften their pairwise interaction on small scales. Placing ourselves within the limit of an average axisymmetric distribution, we stress the connections with generic long-range interacting systems, whose relaxation is described within angle-action coordinates. In particular, we emphasise the existence of two regimes of relaxation, depending on whether the system's profile of mean angular velocity (frequency) is a non-monotonic [resp. monotonic] function of radius, which we refer to as profile (1) [resp. profile (2)]. For profile (1), relaxation occurs through two-body non-local resonant couplings, i.e. $1/N$ effects, as described by the inhomogeneous Landau equation. For profile (2), the impossibility of such two-body resonances submits the system to a ``kinetic blocking''. Relaxation is then driven by three-body couplings, i.e. ${1/N^{2}}$ effects, whose associated kinetic equation has only recently been derived. For both regimes, we compare extensively the kinetic predictions with large ensemble of direct $N$-body simulations. In particular, for profile (1), we explore numerically an effect akin to ``resonance broadening'' close to the extremum of the angular velocity profile. Quantitative description of such subtle nonlinear effects will be the topic of future investigations.</p>

            <p>We examine the spectral properties of collective excitations with finite angular momentum $l$ for a system of interacting fermions near a Pomeranchuk quantum critical point, both in the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. Previous studies found that deep in the Fermi liquid regime, the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ behave differently - the latter is suppressed compared to the former because of kinematic constraints on scattering processes. The main focus of our paper is to understand how the spectral functions for even and odd $l$ evolve as the system enters the non-Fermi liquid regime. We obtain the full scaling function for the electron polarization bubble at arbitrary $l$, which interpolates between the Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid regimes. We show that collective excitations for all $l$ remain stable and causal throughout the crossover and right at the quantum critical point.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Janak Tiwari, Tianli Feng</p>
            <p>While phonons and electrons are well-established heat carriers in solids, photons are typically associated only with radiative transfer between surfaces. Yet for over 70 years, theorists have speculated that thermal photons could also conduct heat within dense, opaque materials -- an idea that has remained unproven and unquantified. Here, we resolve this longstanding question by developing a first-principles framework that reveals and quantifies the internal radiative contribution to thermal conductivity in solids. By analyzing 15 crystalline materials, we uncover photon mean free paths (MFPs) ranging from $\sim$100$\mu$m to over 1cm, with some materials exhibiting surprisingly large radiative thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{rad}}$). Contrary to common assumptions, we show that $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ can scale steeply with temperature (from $T^{1}$ to $T^{4}$), even as MFPs decrease (from $T^{-0.3}$ to $T^{-3}$). We also discover a robust link between photon MFP and phonon linewidths, revealing an unexpected interplay between radiative and phononic heat transport. Crucially, we establish a general formalism to calculate $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ across arbitrary sample thicknesses and surface emissivities -- bridging ballistic and diffusive regimes. Our findings overturn long-held assumptions, uncover a missing channel of heat conduction, and provide a powerful new tool for thermal management in extreme environments.</p>

            <p>Previous investigations have revealed that the Weyl superconductor (WeylSC), realized in a superconductor-topological insulator heterostructure, can exhibit the Landau levels (LLs) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the presence of a vortex lattice. Here, we investigate the low-energy quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the mixed state of heterostructure WeylSCs with unconventional pairing. We find that the spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing induces flat Dirac-LLs of Bogoliubov QPs, whereas the excitation spectra for the spin-triplet chiral $p$-wave pairing show noticeable dispersion, except for the chiral symmetry-protected, dispersionless, zeroth Landau level (ZLL). Distinct QP excitations in the vortex lattice of WeylSCs result in different optical responses, which are manifested as characteristic magneto-optical conductivity curves. We also show that, compared to the topologically protected, charge-neutral, localized Majorana zero mode (MZM), the chiral symmetry-protected ZLL is non-charge-neutral and delocalized. Both of these zero modes may be observed in the mixed state of a heterostructure topological superconductor.</p>

Finally, we investigate spin pumping in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, where spin-valley coupling and Berry curvature effects lead to valley-selective spin excitations and a spin-current Hall effect.

            <p>We theoretically investigate current-induced spin polarization in disordered topological insulator thin films with broken inversion symmetry under an applied in-plane electric field. Utilizing the Kubo formalism within the self-consistent Born approximation and incorporating vertex corrections to account for multiple scattering events, we analyze how disorder, chemical potential, the electrostatic potential difference between the top and bottom surfaces, and momentum-dependent hybridization affect the spin susceptibility. Our results reveal that the spin susceptibility exhibits nonzero values within a finite range around a zero gap, and this range broadens as the chemical potential increases. A higher hybridization strength induces asymmetry in the spin response. A stronger potential difference, breaking inversion symmetry, significantly enhances polarization. This enhancement is a trend attributable to band inversion and is further refined by vertex corrections. These findings provide a theoretical framework for tuning spin-charge conversion in topological thin films, with implications for spintronic device applications.</p>

            <p>Quantum coherence and phase transitions are studied in a finite one-dimensional Bose--Hubbard model using exact diagonalization under thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and disorder. The condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence are computed to characterize the Mott insulator--superfluid transition. Although finite-size effects prevent a sharp transition, ground-state properties reveal signatures of quantum criticality. Thermal fluctuations can enhance coherence via tunneling, a Stark potential promotes localization, and disorder suppresses global superfluidity while preserving local coherence. These results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature reshape coherence and offer insights for quantum simulation and strongly correlated phases. For systems up to six sites with unit filling, a spectral analysis is also performed through the metric mean gap ratio (MGR). However, limited statistics due to the small system size and computational constraints prevent a complete characterization of quantum chaos, yielding only approximate signatures.</p>

            <p>We explore first-passage phenomenology for biased active processes with a renewal-type structure, focusing in particular on paradigmatic run-and-tumble models in both discrete and continuous state spaces. In general, we show there is no equality between distributions of conditional first-passage times to symmetric barriers positioned in and against the bias direction. However, we give conditions for such a duality to be restored asymptotically (in the limit of a large barrier distance) and highlight connections to the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation and the method of images. Our general trajectory arguments of first-passage-time distributions for asymmetric run-and-tumble processes to escape from an interval of arbitrary width are supported by exact analytical results, which we derive extending Montroll's defect technique. Furthermore, we quantify the degree of violation of first-passage duality using Kullback-Leibler divergence and signal-to-noise ratios associated with the first-passage times to the two barriers. We reveal an intriguing dependence of such measures of first-passage asymmetry on the underlying often hidden tumbling dynamics which may inspire inference techniques based on first-passage-time statistics in active systems.</p>

            <h2>Phonon dephasing times determined with time-delayed, broadband CARS</h2>

            <p>Coherent Raman scattering techniques as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), offer significant advantages in terms of pixel dwell times and speed as compared to spontaneous Raman scattering for investigations of crystalline materials. However, the spectral information in CARS is often hampered by the presence of a non-resonant contribution to the scattering process that shifts and distorts the Raman peaks. In this work, we apply a method to obtain non-resonant background-free spectra based on time-delayed, broadband CARS (TD-BCARS) using an intra-pulse excitation scheme. In particular, this method can measure the phononic dephasing times across the full phonon spectrum at once. We test the methodology on amorphous SiO2 (glass), which is used to characterize the setup-specific and material-independent response times, and then apply TD-BCARS to the analysis of single crystals of diamond and ferroelectrics of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA). For diamond, we determine a dephasing time of t = 7.81 ps for the single sp3 peak.</p>

            <h2>Thermodynamic Cost of Random-Time Protocols</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Izaak Neri</p>
            <p>Systems that are driven by a randomly timed, external protocol can seemingly violate the second law of thermodynamics. We show that this thermodynamic paradox is resolved if the outcome of the random time is stored in a memory device. Specifically, we show that the average work required to erase the memory is always larger than the average work gained from the protocol. We also discuss concrete setups that measure random times directly without continuous monitoring. Taken together, this paper discusses the relationship between temporal information and thermodynamics. This framework is relevant for external protocols employing random times, such as, stochastic resetting protocols and cyclically driven heat engines that use randomly timed protocols.</p>

            <h2>A common origin of photoplastic and electroplastic effects in ZnS</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexandra Fonseca Montenegro, Sevim Genlik Polat, Md Mohsinur Rahman Adnan, Maryam Ghazisaeidi, Roberto C. Myers</p>
            <p>Dislocation motion--the atomic-scale mechanism of crystal plasticity--governs the strength and ductility of materials. In functional materials, external stimuli beyond mechanical stress can also affect dislocation glide. In the wide band gap semiconductor ZnS, optical illumination suppresses plasticity, whereas electric fields can enhance dislocation motion. Here, we show that the common underlying mechanism for these phenomena is the charged dislocations that respond to the changes in carrier concentration. Our prior theoretical work showed that locally charged dislocations in ZnS trap excess carriers, triggering core reconstructions that modify their mobility, with the positively charged Zn-rich core dislocations showing the most drastic change. Here, we validate this prediction experimentally by showing that either optical excitation or electronic doping selectively inhibits the glide of Zn-rich dislocations in epitaxially grown ZnS. First, imaging individual interface misfit dislocations under different optical excitation conditions shows that Zn-core glide is strongly reduced as optical power is increased, while the S-core dislocations show negligible sensitivity to light, marking the first, single misfit dislocation imaging of the photoplastic effect. Next, we show that a similar behavior is observed with direct electron (n-type) doping of ZnS epitaxial layers grown beyond the critical thickness. As the n-type dopant density is increased, the resulting Zn-core dislocation density is reduced by more than one order of magnitude, while the S-core density remains essentially unchanged, causing a sign reversal of the strain-anisotropy with n-type doping. These results demonstrate a common origin for the opto-electronic sensitivity of dislocations in ZnS and provide a pathway for the engineering of dislocation content in compound semiconductors.</p>

            <h2>Theory of bound magnetic polarons in cubic and uniaxial antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Dawid Bugajewski, Carmine Autieri, Tomasz Dietl</p>
            <p>Motivated by a recent debate about the origin of remanent magnetization and the corresponding anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets and altermagnets, a theory of bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) in anisotropic antiferromagnetic semiconductors is developed. The theory describes quantitatively the experimentally observed magnitude of excess magnetization and its dependence on the magnetic field in cubic antiferromagnetic EuTe. In contrast to the cubic case, our theory predicts the presence of magnetization hysteresis below Néel temperature in antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy. We show, employing material parameters implied by experimental and ab initio results, that the magnitudes of remanent magnetization and the coercive field are in accord with recent experimental observations for altermagnetic hexagonal MnTe. While the altermagnets have an intrinsic contribution to the remanent magnetization and the anomalous Hall effect, our theory explains the origin of an extrinsic contribution. Our findings address, therefore, a question about the relative contribution to the remanent magnetization of bound magnetic polarons and weak ferromagnetism driven by the antisymmetric exchange interaction, the latter weakened by the formation of antiferromagnetic domains. Furthermore, we provide the theory of BMP spontaneous spin splitting, which can be probed optically.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Bulakhov, A. S. Peletminskii</p>
            <p>We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an interacting Bose gas with a condensate within the energy-functional formulation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approach. For a contact interaction, we derive a self-consistent solution to the HFB equations that intrinsically eliminates divergence. This solution characterizes the equilibrium state featuring a condensate of correlated pairs of particles. We analyze the temperature dependence of key thermodynamic quantities such as condensate density, chemical potential, entropy, pressure, specific heat capacity at constant volume, and isothermal compressibility and compare them with predictions from the Popov approximation (PA). We predict that the transition temperature shifts to higher values due interactions, with the HFB approach yielding a larger shift than the PA. Analysis of the compressibility indicates that a pure pair condensate is unstable, and the stable equilibrium corresponds to only a mixture of single-particle and pair condensates.</p>

            <p>Flexoelectricity - polarization induced by strain gradients - offers a route to polar functionality in centrosymmetric dielectrics, where traditional piezoelectric effects are absent. This study investigates the flexoelectric effect in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ (BHO) thin films, a centrosymmetric and paraelectric perovskite. While a large lattice mismatch induces defect-driven relaxation, a coherently grown BHO film undergoes elastic relaxation, forming intrinsic strain gradients exceeding $10^5\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. A 29-fold enhancement in spontaneous polarization is observed at an electric field of $4\ \mathrm{MV\,cm}^{-1}$ for BHO exhibiting a strain gradient compared to relaxed BHO. This enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric coupling, which is isolated from ferroelectric and piezoelectric contributions due to the centrosymmetric nature and the absence of phase transitions in BHO. The findings establish a clear link between engineered strain gradients and enhanced polarizability in oxide thin films, offering a benchmark system for deconvoluting the flexoelectric effect from other polar effects. These results provide a basis for exploiting flexoelectricity in dielectric devices and advance the fundamental understanding of strain-coupled phenomena in functional oxides.</p>

            <p>Stimulated by recent interest in altermagnets, a novel class of antiferromagnets with macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking, we investigate the coexistence of altermagnetism and superconductivity. By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under the uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models to compare the resulting phase diagrams: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. We show that the multisublattice structure is crucial for realizing the phase-modulated superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring this exotic superconductivity without external magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>We introduce a combined density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) framework to compute the capacitance of nanocapacitors and directly extract the dielectric response of a sub-nanometer dielectric under bias. We identify that at the nanoscale conventional capacitance evaluations based on stored charge per unit voltage suffer from an ill-posed partitioning of electrode and dielectric charge. This partitioning directly impacts the geometric definition of capacitance through the capacitor width, which in turn makes the evaluation of dielectric response uncertain. This ambiguous separation further induces spurious interfacial polarizability when analyzed via maximally localized Wannier functions. Focusing on crystalline ice, we develop a robust charge-separation protocol that yields unique capacitance-derived polarizability and dielectric constants, unequivocally demonstrating that confinement neither alters ice's intrinsic electronic response nor its insensitivity to proton order. Our results lay the groundwork for rigorous interpretation of capacitor measurements in low-dimensional dielectric materials.</p>

The DPVM reproduces key features of vortex pair dynamics seen in full simulations, including anisotropic velocities, deformed orbits, and directional motion, offering a minimal and accurate model for dipolar vortex dynamics.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Indrashish Saha, Lori Graham-Brady</p>
            <p>Developing materials with tailored mechanical performance requires iteration over a large number of proposed designs. When considering dynamic fracture, experiments at every iteration are usually infeasible. While high-fidelity, physics-based simulations can potentially reduce experimental efforts, they remain computationally expensive. As a faster alternative, key dynamic properties can be predicted directly from microstructural images using deep-learning surrogate models. In this work, the spallation of ductile polycrystals under plate-impact loading at strain rates of O(10^6 s^-1) is considered. A physics-based numerical model that couples crystal plasticity and a cohesive zone model is used to generate data for the surrogate models. Three architectures - 3D U-Net, 3D Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-3D), and U-FNO were trained on the particle-velocity field data from the numerical model. The generalization of the models was evaluated using microstructures with varying grain sizes and aspect ratios. U-FNO and 3D U-Net performed significantly better than FNO-3D across all datasets. Furthermore, U-FNO and 3D U-Net exhibited comparable accuracy for every metric considered in this study. However, training the U-FNO requires almost twice the computational effort compared to the 3D U-Net, making it a desirable option for a surrogate model.</p>

Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics, nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions. Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations, temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.</p>

            <h2>Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in twisted homobilayer MoTe$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zhao Liu, Bohao Li, Yuhao Shi, Fengcheng Wu</p>
            <p>We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moiré lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moiré lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. We characterize the interaction between two FCI quasiparticles and find a crossover from repulsive to attractive interaction as gate-to-sample distances decreases. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chenxi Bai, Zhaoxin Liang</p>
            <p>Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This progress prompts a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we address this question by demonstrating the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model incorporating next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we uncover that NNN interaction parameters can induce fractional topological phases|even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</p>

            <p>The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) provides nontrivial bounds among physical quantities, as exemplified by the metric-curvature inequality. In this paper, we investigate various bounds for different observables through certain generalizations of the QGT. First, we demonstrate that bounds hold for all linear responses, which are produced by a QGT extended to many-body states, finite temperature, and general parameter space. As an application, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the convexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, we establish a bound between the Drude weight and the orbital magnetization. The equality is exactly satisfied in the Landau level system, and systems with nearly flat bands tend to approach equality as well. We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support that the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system. Moreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order multipole, magnetic quadrupole. Finally, we discuss the analogy between the QGT and the uncertainty principle, emphasizing that the existence of nontrivial bounds necessarily reflects quantum effects.</p>

An almost linear variation of the third-order elastic modulus with temperature is demonstrated, revealing opposite trends for uniaxial loadings along the armchair or the zigzag direction. The detailed dependence of the distributions of bond lengths and bond angles both on strain and temperature is presented for the first time, along with approximate analytical expressions. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</p>

Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters.

            <p>We examine the magnetic and electrical transport properties of the hexagonal EuIn2As2 compound, combining experimental and theoretical results. This compound is predicted to be an axion-insulator from an electronic point of view and an altermagnet while in the collinear magnetic phase. However, experiments indicate that the Fermi level lies within the valence band rather than in the topological gap, potentially leading to the dominance of magnetic properties. Our detailed studies on magnetization and electrical transport support the presence of a broken-helix antiferromagnetic state, which was previously identified by X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Notably, we observed within that state a field-induced metamagnetic transition marked by a large hysteresis in magnetoresistance, which turns into a sharp upturn for the magnetic field tilted by 15 degree from the c-axis of the crystal. Combined with theoretical calculations, it is explained that the application of a magnetic field changes the low-resistivity antiferromagnetic domain walls to the high-resistivity domain walls due to the reduction in the Fermi surface sheets interaction area in the domain walls, originating from p-orbitals of As. EuIn2As2, therefore, presents a new case study that broadens the understanding of complex magnetic structures and their influence on electrical transport.</p>

To address this, we develop an ensemble-based regression model trained on DFT data and employ local environment descriptors to map the local ($\sim 2$\,nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich magnetic moiré textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic environments and are beyond analytical description.</p>

            <p>CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC) due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face inherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient current density and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily constrained by their dependence on direct and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating ferroelectric switching, direct, Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device structure, the simulated TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high current density and a remarkable on-off current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Bauch, F. Lombardi, G. Seibold</p>
            <p>Enhancing superconductivity through material design is a central goal in quantum materials research. Moire engineering, where twisting stacked layers creates long-wavelength modulations and flat bands, has shown how electronic correlations can be amplified and eventually used to raise the superconducting critical temperature Tc. Yet this approach is largely confined to van der Waals materials and offers limited tunability. Here we explore a moire-inspired alternative: imposing artificial superpotentials on otherwise homogeneous systems to engineer flat electronic minibands. Whether such superlattice potentials can truly enhance superconductivity and sustain a finite superfluid stiffness remains, however, an open question. Our calculations show that a periodic superpotential imposed to a 2D system can indeed enhance superconductivity by reconstructing the electronic bands and creating regions of large density of states, leading to a substantial increase of Tc. In contrast to conventional flat band systems, where the superfluid stiffness arises solely from quantum geometry through the quantum metric, a modulated system inherits kinetic energy from the filled minibands below the Fermi level. This inherited component coexists with a positive quantum geometric contribution, yielding a finite and robust stiffness even when the upper band becomes nearly flat. The resulting superconducting state remains coherent and resilient against weak to moderate disorder. Our findings demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a tunable route to enhance superconductivity beyond twist based moire systems, unifying flat band amplification of pairing with preserved phase stiffness. They further highlight the central role of quantum geometry in shaping collective electronic phenomena and point to superlattice design as a promising platform for next-generation superconductors.</p>

            <p>We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n > 1$, a particle starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution $P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n > 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders -- to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x, n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.</p>

            <h2>Dual Cross-Linked Hydrogels: Linear Rheology and Fractional Calculus Modeling</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Agniva Dutta, Valeriy V. Ginzburg, Gleb Vasilyev, Eyal Zussman</p>
            <p>Hydrogels are increasingly recognized as a versatile platform for applications spanning from tissue engineering to soft robotics or flexible electronics. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing and tailoring their mechanical performance to meet application-specific demands. However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models.</p>

            <h2>Physically Interpretable Descriptors Drive the Materials Design of Metal Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seong-Hoon Jang, Di Zhang, Hung Ba Tran, Xue Jia, Kiyoe Konno, Ryuhei Sato, Shin-ichi Orimo, Hao Li</p>
            <p>Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.</p>

            <h2>Interaction-driven quantum criticality in two-dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals with time-reversal symmetry breaking</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yi-Kun Fang, Jing Wang</p>
            <p>We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagomé semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale, signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagomé QBCP and related materials.</p>

            <p>We present a differentiation framework for plane-wave density-functional theory (DFT) that combines the strengths of forward-mode algorithmic differentiation (AD) and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). In the resulting AD-DFPT framework derivatives of any DFT output quantity with respect to any input parameter (e.g. geometry, density functional or pseudopotential) can be computed accurately without deriving gradient expressions by hand. We implement AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> A. L. Chernyshev</p>
            <p>We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.</p>

            <p>Understanding the electronic structure of actinide materials is crucial for both fundamental research and nuclear applications. The partially filled 5f shells exhibit complex behavior due to strong correlations and ligand hybridization, requiring advanced spectroscopic techniques. Here, we report on the development and application of high-resolution valence-band resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (VB-RIXS) experiments at the uranium M$_{4,5}$ edges (3551 and 3725\,eV). We present data of UO$_2$, a well-established model actinide compound. VB-RIXS is particularly well suited for probing the 5f-shell electronic structure, as it probes, in contrast to core-to-core RIXS, excitations without leaving a high-energy core hole in the final state. In VB-RIXS, we achieve energy resolutions of 50\,meV (M$_5$) and 90\,meV (M$_4$), enabling the resolution of multiplet excitations and crystal-field effects, as well as charge-transfer and fluorescence-like features with unprecedented clarity. As such, high resolution VB-RIXS offers direct insights into both low-energy, near ground-state properties and high-energy hybridization and covalency effects. Our results demonstrate the power of VB-RIXS as a versatile and powerful tool for probing the strongly correlated electronic structure of actinide materials, providing essential input for quantitative modeling and the validation of theoretical concepts.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Md Shakhawath Hossain, Dylan G. Stone, G. Landry, Xiaoxue Xu, Carlo Bradac, Toan Trong Tran</p>
            <p>Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.</p>

            <p>Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as a new approach in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where strong-coupled magnon-photon modes can be achieved using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilization of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its experimental feasibility and wide generality as manifested in hematite.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tyafur Rahman Pathan, Daryoosh Vashaee</p>
            <p>The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.</p>

The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium, resulting in a ferroelectric rectification of the driving signal.</p>

            <h2>Multiscale Modeling of Abnormal Grain Growth: Role of Solute Segregation and Grain Boundary Character</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Albert Linda, Rajdip Mukherjee, Somnath Bhowmick</p>
            <p>Abnormal grain growth (AGG) influences the properties of polycrystalline materials; however, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of solute segregation at the grain boundary (GB), are difficult to quantify precisely. This study demonstrates a multiscale framework that integrates atomic-scale segregation energetics (using density functional theory) with mesoscale grain growth dynamics (using phase-field model) to investigate AGG, using $\alpha$-Fe as an example system. Multisite segregation energies are calculated for symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ axis for nine different solutes (Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Ti, W, and V), encompassing three different types of coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries: $\sum 3 (11\bar{2})$, $\sum 9 (\bar{2}21)$, and $\sum 3 (\bar{1}11)$. The model takes into account the effect of solute drag on GB mobility, estimated using a bulk solute concentration of 0.1 at\%. The results demonstrate that AGG originates due to GB anisotropy, the extent of which largely depends on the type of solute atom present. Such a complex dependence necessitates using a multiscale model to understand AGG comprehensively. In general, low-energy $\Sigma 3$ boundaries are found to have higher mobility and show preferential growth for most of the solutes, other than Co. The study reveals how the distribution of GB types significantly influences AGG. When 10-30\% of the GBs are high-mobility type, crown-like morphologies are observed, leading to AGG. These findings underscore the critical role of GB chemistry and crystallography in governing AGG, and the model can be generalized to provide a predictive framework for controlling grain growth through strategic solute design in advanced alloys.</p>

In this work, we investigate phase transitions among various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model.

Along each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.</p>

            <p>We present a minimal model for autonomous robotic swarms in one- and higher-dimensional spaces, where identical, field-driven agents interact pairwise to self-organize spacing and independently follow local gradients sensed through quantized digital sensors. We show that the collective response of a multi-agent train amplifies sensitivity to weak gradients beyond what is achievable by a single agent. We discover a fractional transport phenomenon in which, under a uniform gradient, collective motion freezes abruptly whenever the ratio of intra-agent sensor separation to inter-agent spacing satisfies a number-theoretic commensurability condition. This commensurability locking persists even as the number of agents tends to infinity. We find that this condition is exactly solvable on the rationals -- a dense subset of real numbers -- providing analytic, testable predictions for when transport stalls. Our findings establish a surprising bridge between number theory and emergent transport in swarm robotics, informing design principles with implications for collective migration, analog computation, and even the exploration of number-theoretic structure via physical experimentation.</p>

Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free, parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.</p>

            <p>We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional higher-wave-symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$ symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.</p>

By specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the space domain.</p>

            <p>The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.</p>

            <h2>Koopman Mode Decomposition of Thermodynamic Dissipation in Nonlinear Langevin Dynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Daiki Sekizawa, Sosuke Ito, Masafumi Oizumi</p>
            <p>Nonlinear oscillations are commonly observed in complex systems far from equilibrium, such as living organisms. These oscillations are essential for sustaining vital processes, like neuronal firing, circadian rhythms, and heartbeats. In such systems, thermodynamic dissipation is necessary to maintain oscillations against noise. However, due to their nonlinear dynamics, it has been challenging to determine how the characteristics of oscillations, such as frequency, amplitude, and coherent patterns across elements, influence dissipation. To resolve this issue, we employ Koopman mode decomposition, which recasts nonlinear dynamics as a linear evolution in a function space. This linearization allows the dynamics to be decomposed into temporal oscillatory modes coherent across elements, with the Koopman eigenvalues determining their frequencies. Using this method, we decompose thermodynamic dissipation caused by nonconservative forces into contributions from oscillatory modes in overdamped nonlinear Langevin dynamics. We show that the dissipation from each mode is proportional to its frequency squared and its intensity, providing an interpretable, mode-by-mode picture. In the noisy FitzHugh--Nagumo model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in quantifying the impact of oscillatory modes on dissipation during nonlinear phenomena like stochastic resonance and bifurcation. For instance, our analysis of stochastic resonance reveals that the greatest dissipation at the optimal noise intensity is supported by a broad spectrum of frequencies, whereas at non-optimal noise levels, dissipation is dominated by specific frequency modes. Our work offers a general approach to connecting oscillations to dissipation in noisy environments and improves our understanding of diverse oscillation phenomena from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective.</p>

            <p>It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</p>

            <p>The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPTs before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries can be obtained from invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible \textit{$G$-ality defects}. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using the SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification was previously determined by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N < 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> David G. Clark, Owen Marschall, Alexander van Meegen, Ashok Litwin-Kumar</p>
            <p>Studies of the dynamics of nonlinear recurrent neural networks often assume independent and identically distributed couplings, but large-scale connectomics data indicate that biological neural circuits exhibit markedly different connectivity properties. These include rapidly decaying singular-value spectra and structured singular-vector overlaps. Here, we develop a theory to analyze how these forms of structure shape high-dimensional collective activity in nonlinear recurrent neural networks. We first introduce the random-mode model, a random-matrix ensemble related to the singular-value decomposition that enables control over the spectrum and right-left mode overlaps. Then, using a novel path-integral calculation, we derive analytical expressions that reveal how connectivity structure affects features of collective dynamics: the dimension of activity, which quantifies the number of high-variance collective-activity fluctuations, and the temporal correlations that characterize the timescales of these fluctuations. We show that connectivity structure can be invisible in single-neuron activities while dramatically shaping collective activity. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear, high-dimensional nature of these networks, the dimension of activity depends on just two connectivity parameters -- the variance of the couplings and the effective rank of the coupling matrix, which quantifies the number of dominant rank-one connectivity components. We contrast the effects of single-neuron heterogeneity and low dimensional connectivity, making predictions about how z-scoring data affects the dimension of activity. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of structured overlaps between left and right modes in the Drosophila connectome, incorporate them into the theory, and show how they further shape collective dynamics.</p>

            <h2>Statistical mechanical mapping and maximum-likelihood thresholds for the surface code under generic single-qubit coherent errors</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>The surface code, one of the leading candidates for quantum error correction, is known to protect encoded quantum information against stochastic, i.e., incoherent errors. The protection against coherent errors, such as from unwanted gate rotations, is however understood only for special cases, such as rotations about the $X$ or $Z$ axes. Here we consider generic single-qubit coherent errors in the surface code, i.e., rotations by angle $\alpha$ about an axis that can be chosen arbitrarily. We develop a statistical mechanical mapping for such errors and perform entanglement analysis in transfer matrix space to numerically establish the existence of an error-correcting phase, which we chart in a subspace of rotation axes to estimate the corresponding maximum-likelihood thresholds $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$. The classical statistical mechanics model we derive is a random-bond Ising model with complex couplings and four-spin interactions (i.e., a complex-coupled Ashkin-Teller model). The error correcting phase, $\alpha<\alpha_\mathrm{th}$, where the logical error rate decreases exponentially with code distance, is shown to correspond in transfer matrix space to a gapped one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian exhibiting spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Our numerical results rest on two key ingredients: (i) we show that the state evolution under the transfer matrix -- a non-unitary (1+1)-dimensional quantum circuit -- can be efficiently numerically simulated using matrix product states. Based on this approach, (ii) we also develop an algorithm to (approximately) sample syndromes based on their Born probability. The $\alpha_\mathrm{th}$ values we find show that the maximum likelihood thresholds for coherent errors are larger than those for the corresponding incoherent errors (from the Pauli twirl), and significantly exceed the values found using minimum weight perfect matching.</p>

            <h2>Universal framework for anisotropic particles with resonance laws and splitting</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Asaf Farhi, Haim Suchowski</p>
            <p>Nanophotonics enables unprecedented control over light-matter interactions, yet conventional isotropic materials limit the spectral range and richness of mode responses in subwavelength structures. Anisotropic subwavelength particles -- ubiquitous in natural and engineered systems -- offer new degrees of freedom that couple geometry and material properties, unlocking previously inaccessible spectral regions. Here, we establish a universal quasistatic framework describing the eigenmodes and resonance conditions of uniaxial and biaxial nanoparticles. Closed-form solutions reveal axial-permittivity sum rules and a fundamental material-anisotropy-induced symmetry breaking, manifesting as resonance splitting and novel radiation patterns. Generalizing the theory to ellipsoids provides geometric tunability of the multispectral response, while analytic predictions of quality factors elucidate how anisotropy governs mode localization and energy loss. Full-wave simulations of h-BN and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ nanoparticles confirm the theory and highlight its predictive power. This framework unifies the understanding of anisotropic nanostructures across optics, thermal transport, and magnetism, opening pathways to a new generation of photonic devices with tunable multispectral response and controlled emission patterns, including directional detectors and spectrally selective mid infrared sensors.</p>

            <p>Efficient audio feature extraction is critical for low-latency, resource-constrained speech recognition. Conventional preprocessing techniques, such as Mel Spectrogram, Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP), and Learnable Spectrogram, achieve high classification accuracy but require large feature sets and significant computation. The low-latency and power efficiency benefits of neuromorphic computing offer a strong potential for audio classification. Here, we introduce memristive nanowire networks as a neuromorphic hardware preprocessing layer for spoken-digit classification, a capability not previously demonstrated. Nanowire networks extract compact, informative features directly from raw audio, achieving a favorable trade-off between accuracy, dimensionality reduction from the original audio size (data compression) , and training time efficiency. Compared with state-of-the-art software techniques, nanowire features reach 98.95% accuracy with 66 times data compression (XGBoost) and 97.9% accuracy with 255 times compression (Random Forest) in sub-second training latency. Across multiple classifiers nanowire features consistently achieve more than 90% accuracy with more than 62.5 times compression, outperforming features extracted by conventional state-of-the-art techniques such as MFCC in efficiency without loss of performance. Moreover, nanowire features achieve 96.5% accuracy classifying multispeaker audios, outperforming all state-of-the-art feature accuracies while achieving the highest data compression and lowest training time. Nanowire network preprocessing also enhances linear separability of audio data, improving simple classifier performance and generalizing across speakers. These results demonstrate that memristive nanowire networks provide a novel, low-latency, and data-efficient feature extraction approach, enabling high-performance neuromorphic audio classification.</p>

            <h2>No Free Lunch From Random Feature Ensembles: Scaling Laws and Near-Optimality Conditions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin S. Ruben, William L. Tong, Hamza Tahir Chaudhry, Cengiz Pehlevan</p>
            <p>Given a fixed budget for total model size, one must choose between training a single large model or combining the predictions of multiple smaller models. We investigate this trade-off for ensembles of random-feature ridge regression models in both the overparameterized and underparameterized regimes. Using deterministic equivalent risk estimates, we prove that when a fixed number of parameters is distributed among $K$ independently trained models, the ridge-optimized test risk increases with $K$. Consequently, a single large model achieves optimal performance. We then ask when ensembles can achieve \textit{near}-optimal performance. In the overparameterized regime, we show that, to leading order, the test error depends on ensemble size and model size only through the total feature count, so that overparameterized ensembles consistently achieve near-optimal performance. To understand underparameterized ensembles, we derive scaling laws for the test risk as a function of total parameter count when the ensemble size and parameters per ensemble member are jointly scaled according to a ``growth exponent'' $\ell$. While the optimal error scaling is always achieved by increasing model size with a fixed ensemble size, our analysis identifies conditions on the kernel and task eigenstructure under which near-optimal scaling laws can be obtained by joint scaling of ensemble size and model size.</p>

            <p>Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial implementations are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley-splitting minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. A multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Using simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities in these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on such encouraging results, we propose a modular qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between different plaquettes.</p>

            <p>We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for Lévy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</p>

            <h2>E2Former: An Efficient and Equivariant Transformer with Linear-Scaling Tensor Products</h2>

            <p>Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have demonstrated significant success in modeling microscale systems, including those in chemistry, biology and materials science. However, EGNNs face substantial computational challenges due to the high cost of constructing edge features via spherical tensor products, making them impractical for large-scale systems. To address this limitation, we introduce E2Former, an equivariant and efficient transformer architecture that incorporates the Wigner $6j$ convolution (Wigner $6j$ Conv). By shifting the computational burden from edges to nodes, the Wigner $6j$ Conv reduces the complexity from $O(|\mathcal{E}|)$ to $ O(| \mathcal{V}|)$ while preserving both the model's expressive power and rotational equivariance. We show that this approach achieves a 7x-30x speedup compared to conventional $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ convolutions. Furthermore, our empirical results demonstrate that the derived E2Former mitigates the computational challenges of existing approaches without compromising the ability to capture detailed geometric information. This development could suggest a promising direction for scalable and efficient molecular modeling.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gengyue Dong, Simão João, Hanwen Jin, Johannes Lischner</p>
            <p>Hot electrons and holes generated from the decay of localized surface plasmons (LSPs) in aluminum nanostructures have significant potential for applications in photocatalysis, photodetection and other optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a theoretical study of hot-carrier generation in aluminum nanospheres using a recently developed modelling approach that combines a solution of the macroscopic Maxwell equation with large-scale atomistic tight-binding simulations. Different from standard plasmonic metals, such as gold or silver, we find that the energetic distribution of hot electrons and holes in aluminium nanoparticles is almost constant for all allowed energies. Only at relatively high photon energies, a reduction of the generation rate of highly energetic holes and electrons close to the Fermi level is observed which is attributed to band structure effects suppressing interband decay channels. We also investigate the dependence of hot-carrier properties on the nanoparticle diameter and the environment dielectric constant. The insights from our study can inform experimental efforts towards highly efficient aluminum-based hot-carrier devices.</p>

            <h2>Phase transitions in the inner crust of neutron stars within the superfluid band theory: Competition between $^1\text{S}_0$ pairing and spin polarization under finite temperature and magnetic field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kenta Yoshimura, Kazuyuki Sekizawa</p>
            <p>Phase transitions of matter under changes of external environment such as temperature and magnetic field have attracted great interests to various quantum many-body systems. Several phase transitions must have occurred in neutron stars as well such as transitions from normal to superfluid/superconducting phases and crust formation. In this work, we extend the superfluid band theory, which has been formulated in our previous work [K. Yoshimura and K. Sekizawa, Phys. Rev. C 109, 065804 (2024)] based on the Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) for superfluid systems, into the finite temperature and finite magnetic field systems. As a result of the finite temperature calculations, we find that the superfluidity of neutrons dissapears at around $k_\text{B}T=0.6$--$0.9\,$ MeV, and ``melting'' of nuclear slabs, that is, a structural change into the uniform matter, takes place at around $k_\text{B}T=2.5$--$4.5\,$ MeV. We also reveal that these transition temperatures exhibit a systematical dependence on the baryon densities. By turning on the magnetic field, we find that protons' spin gets polarized at around $B=10^{16}\,$G, whereas neutrons' spin is kept unpolarized on average up to around $B=10^{17}\,$G. Intriguingly, our microscopic calculations reveal that neutrons' spin is actually polarized locally inside and outside of the slab already at $B\sim10^{16}\,$G, while keeping the system unpolarized in total. As a conclusion, we have demonstrated validity and usefulness of the fully self-consistent superfluid nuclear band theory for describing neutron star matter under arbitrary temperature and magnetic field. Critical temperatures and magnetic fields have been predicted for 1) superfluid to normal transition, 2) crust formation, and 3) spin polarization, under conditions relevant to realistic neutron star environments.</p>

The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared, going substantially beyond the previously discovered spectral equivalence. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this enhanced infrared equivalence.</p>

            <p>A novel approach is proposed to characterize the dynamics of perturbed many-body integrable systems. Focusing on the paradigmatic case of the Toda chain under non-integrable Hamiltonian perturbations, this study introduces a method based the time evolution of the Lax eigenvalues $\lambda_\alpha$ as a proxy of the quasi-particles velocities and of the perturbed Toda actions. A set of exact equations of motion for the $\lambda_\alpha$ is derived that closely resemble those for eigenenergies of a quantum problem (also known as the Pechukas-Yukawa gas). Numerical simulations suggest that the invariant measure of such dynamics is basically the thermal density of states of the Toda lattice, regardless of the form of the perturbation.</p>

            <p>This paper constitutes a step in the direction of developing integer lattice gas methods as an attractive alternative to lattice Boltzmann methods. Here we show that to Boltzmann limit the one dimensional Blommel integer lattice gas is very close to entropic lattice Boltzmann. More interestingly the integer lattice gas retains additional correlations that prevent the existence of a well defined Boltzmann limit. In the analysis of the decaying sine wave we will see that in some situations the bulk viscosity can crucially depend on such correlations beyond the Boltzmann limit. A sampling collision operator, introduced here, can speed up the execution time to make the algorithm obtain comparable computational efficiency to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods.</p>

            <p>Schrödinger cat states play an important role for applications in continuous variable quantum information technologies. As macroscopic superpositions they are inherently protected against certain types of noise making cat qubits a promising candidate for quantum computing. It has been shown recently that cat states occur naturally in driven Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) as degenerate ground states with even and odd parity that are adiabatically connected to the respective lowest two Fock states by switching off the drive. To perform operations with several cat qubits one crucial task is to create entanglement between them. Here, we demonstrate efficient transformations of multi-mode cat states through adiabatic and diabatic switching between Kerr-type Hamiltonians with degenerate ground state manifolds. These transformations can be used to directly initialize the cats as entangled Bell states in contrast to initializing them from entangled Fock states.</p>

            <p>In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )> \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L < \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</p>

            <p>Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak couplings to fermions and Chern-Simons couplings to gauge fields. We propose a novel detection mechanism based on symmetry-breaking magnetoelectric materials with a linear axionic coupling between magnetization and ferroelectric polarization. The focus is on a strain gradient Sr2IrO4 film, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and an out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables a direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field, which amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism is expected to enhance the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lucas Sá, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting ``gamma-matrix'' spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. However, we identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.</p>

            <p>Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are essential for the numerical study of large-scale quantum many-body systems, yet their utility has been significantly hampered by the difficulty in computing key quantities such as off-diagonal operators and entanglement. This work introduces Bell-QMC, a novel QMC framework leveraging Bell sampling, a two-copy measurement protocol in the transversal Bell basis. We demonstrate that Bell-QMC enables an efficient and unbiased estimation of both challenging classes of observables, offering a significant advantage over previous QMC approaches. Notably, the entanglement across all system partitions can be computed in a single Bell-QMC simulation. We implement this method within the stochastic series expansion (SSE), where we design an efficient update scheme for sampling the configurations in the Bell basis. We demonstrate our algorithm in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, extracting universal quantum features using only simple diagonal measurements. This work establishes Bell-QMC as a powerful framework that significantly expands the accessible quantum properties in QMC simulations, providing a substantial advantage over conventional QMC.</p>

Notably, the total energy transmission, which quantifies the energy flux from one CFT through the junction, is bounded above by the effective central charge associated with both the CFTs and the junction. Results for energy transport in conformal interfaces are recovered in a special limit. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to junctions connecting $N$ 2D CFTs.</p>

            <p>The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We highlight the relevance of local quantum effects by a comparison with the classical analogue system.</p>

We show that tilt correction and summation of the symmetric and antisymmetric scattering components within the bright-field disk -- corresponding to tilt-corrected bright field (tcBF) and tilt-corrected differential phase contrast (tcDPC) respectively -- enables aberration-corrected, bright-field phase contrast imaging (acBF) that makes maximal use of the 4D-STEM information under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA). Beyond the WPOA, we identify the contrast transfer from the interference between inelastic/plural scattering electrons, which show up as quadratic terms, and show that under overfocus conditions, contrast can be further enhanced at selected frequencies, similar to phase-contrast TEM imaging. There is also usable information encoded in the dark field region which we demonstrate by constructing a tilt-corrected dark-field image (tcDF) that sums up the incoherent scattering components and holds promise for depth sectioning of strong scatterers. This framework generalizes phase contrast theory in conventional/scanning transmission electron microscopy to 4D-STEM and provides analytical models and insights into full-field iterative ptychography, which blindly exploits all above contrast mechanisms.</p>

            <h2>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alesanmi Richmond Rerelope Odufisan</p>
            <p>We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Seiberg, Shu-Heng Shao, Wucheng Zhang</p>
            <p>We study a number of 1+1d lattice models with anti-unitary symmetries that simultaneously reflect space and reverse time. Some of these symmetries are anomalous, leading to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraints, thus excluding a trivially gapped phase. Examples include a mod 8 anomaly in the Majorana chain and various mod 2 anomalies in the spin chain. In some cases, there is an exact, non-anomalous lattice symmetry that flows in the continuum to CPT. In some other cases, the CPT symmetry of the continuum theory is emergent or absent. Depending on the model, the anomaly of the lattice model is matched in the continuum in different ways. In particular, it can be mapped to an emergent anomaly of an emanant symmetry.</p>

            <h2>Exact Solution for Two $δ$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $δ$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maxim Olshanii, Mathias Albert, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Patrizia Vignolo, Steven G. Jackson</p>
            <p>In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jorge-Humberto Urrea-Quintero, David Anton, Laura De Lorenzis, Henning Wessels</p>
            <p>The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression (LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost. While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the $\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for $\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform consistently well in discovering isotropic and anisotropic materials, yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.</p>

            <p>We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</p>

            <h2>Beyond Belief Propagation: Cluster-Corrected Tensor Network Contraction with Exponential Convergence</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Siddhant Midha, Yifan F. Zhang</p>
            <p>Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.</p>

            <p>Since Landau's theory, polarons have been understood as quasiparticles in which charges are dressed by the lattice field, yet decades of transport and spectroscopic studies have yielded only static indirect renormalizations. Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time, revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.</p>

The resulting correlated insulators are metastable, with lifetimes exceeding microseconds.

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials have become a rich playground for the exploration of correlated quantum phases, and recent studies have begun to probe their non-equilibrium dynamics under femtosecond laser excitation. In a time-resolved experiment, optical excitation of the multilayer structure can lead not only to rich dynamic responses from the target layers, such as moiré interfaces, but also to additional device functionality from the layer degree of freedom. Here, we investigate optical excitation in a prototypical moiré device of dual-gated twisted WSe2 bilayers, with few-layer graphite gates and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spacers. We establish an ultrafast photodoping mechanism in the moiré bilayer from photo-thermionic emission of the graphite gates. Using transient reflectance experiments, we reveal photo-induced hole injection evidenced by: (i) a shift of gate voltages at which optical signatures of correlated insulators are observed, (ii) a persistent optical signature indicative of charge diffusion at microsecond timescales and local charge buildup from pulse-to-pulse accumulation, and (iii) photoinduced absorption due likely to transient formation of correlated insulators. We further demonstrate that the injected holes can be selectively controlled by tuning the excitation energy, fluence, and gate bias.</p>

            <p>Precise probe and control of various quantum degrees of freedom in novel quantum matter are central to understanding fundamental quantum physics and hold promise for innovative routes to encode and process information. Chirality is one such degree of freedom that has recently attracted intense research interest, especially for Weyl fermions in topological Weyl semimetals. The coupling of chiral degrees of freedom through light-matter interactions and the versatile control of these couplings through external fields can lead to precise quantum control of Weyl fermions. In this work, we demonstrate the observation of light chirality-dependent photocurrent in the mid-infrared regime. Excitation wavelength-dependent measurements reveal that the photocurrent originates from the injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions by chiral polarized mid-infrared photons. The optical process that generates unbalanced chiral polarized Weyl fermions is determined to be a third-order nonlinear photocurrent process. Compared with nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals, such coupling is versatilely tunable in magnetic Weyl semimetals with the magnetization direction and external electric field in addition to the chirality of light. Our results are not only directly applicable to tunable circular-polarization-sensitive photodetection in the mid-infrared regime, but also pave the way toward functional quantum devices that utilize the chiral quantum degrees of freedom of Weyl fermions.</p>

            <p>Light scattering plays an essential role in uncovering the properties of quantum states through light-matter interactions. Here, we explore the transition from Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to droplets in a dipolar $^{166}$Er gas by employing superradiant light scattering as both a probing and controlling tool. We observe that the efficiency of superradiant scattering exhibits a non-monotonic behavior akin to the rate of sample expansion during the transition, signaling its sensitivity to the initial quantum state, and in turn, revealing the BEC-droplet transition. Through controlled atom depletion via superradiance, we analyze the sample's expansion dynamics and aspect ratio to identify the BEC-droplet phases distinctly, supported by Gaussian variational ansatz calculations. Finally, using these two approaches, we track how the BEC-droplet transition points shift under varying magnetic field orientations. Our work opens new avenues for studying quantum states through superradiance, advancing our understanding of both the BEC-droplet crossover and its coherence properties.</p>

            <h2>Optimal spin-charge interconversion in graphene through spin-pseudospin entanglement control</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joaquín Medina Dueñas, Santiago Giménez de Castro, Jose H. Garcia, Stephan Roche</p>
            <p>The electrical generation of spin signals is of central interest for spintronics, where graphene stands as a relevant platform as its spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is tuned by proximity effects. Here, we propose an enhancement of spin-charge interconversion in graphene by controlling the intraparticle entanglement between the spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that, although the spin alone is not conserved in Rashba-Dirac systems, a combined spin-pseudospin operator is conserved. This conserved quantity represents the interconversion between pure spin and pseudospin textures to a spin-pseudospin entangled structure, where Kane-Mele SOC tunes this balance. By these means, we achieve spin-charge interconversion of 100\% efficiency via the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Quantum transport simulations in disordered micron-size systems demonstrate the robustness of this effect, and also reveal a disorder resilient spin Hall effect generated by the interplay between Rashba and Kane-Mele SOC. Our findings propose a platform for maximally efficient spin-charge interconversion, and establish spin-pseudospin correlations as a mechanism to tailor spintronic devices.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Michał Zegrodnik, Waseem Akbar, Andrzej Biborski, Louk Rademaker</p>
            <p>The recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity has pointed to twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer as a versatile platform for studying the correlated and topological phases of matter. Here we analyze the effect of the displacement field and electron interactions on the formation of a topological paired state in twisted WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on the effective single band $t$-$J$-$U$ model supplemented with intersite Coulomb interaction term and treated within the Gutzwiller approximation. We show that the superconducting phase is stabilized in a small range of displacement fields where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling, which is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental data. According to our analysis, such a circumstance comes as a result of a subtle interplay between the large density of states of the Van Hove singularity, in combination with the renormalization effects that appear in the weak-to-moderate correlations regime. The two factors create favorable conditions for the SC pairing only in a small area of the phase diagram.</p>

            <h2>Spin filtering on demand via localized states in an atomic-scale resonant tunneling magnetic tunnel junction</h2>

            <p>Spin filtering and its back-action spin transfer torque (STT) are key ingredients of latest spintronic devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Resonant tunneling (RT), implemented by design or occurring as parasitic effects, is known to crucially affect macroscopic device performance, but direct experimental access to its individual microscopic processes has remained difficult. Here we apply the RT scheme from MTJs to spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) for ultimate miniaturization obtained by addressing distinct sites on individual nanomagnets. Combined with energy selectivity, our experimental model set-up enables to study the spin filtering capabilities of RT through an individual spin-split vacuum resonance state and of the corresponding STT exerted on the nanomagnet. We find, that the sign and magnitude of the STT follow the effective spin-polarization of the resonance state, which, as we show, can by tailored on demand either by adjusting the applied bias or the current injection point on the nanostructure. We anticipate, that our atomic-scale RT-MTJ approach and the discovery of a versatile tunable spin-filter at smallest scale will prove invaluable for studying and designing next generation MTJs potentially based on recently discovered 2D van-der-Waals magnets or altermagnets.</p>

            <p>Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$, exhibit unique optical and electronic properties. Vertical stacking of layers of one or more TMDs, to create heterostructures, has expanded the fields of moiré physics and twistronics. Bottom-up fabrication techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, have advanced the creation of heterostructures beyond what was possible with mechanical exfoliation and stacking. These techniques now enable the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, where two or more monolayers are covalently bonded in the plane of their atoms. At their atomically sharp interfaces, lateral heterostructures exhibit additional phenomena, such as the formation of charge-transfer excitons, in which the electron and hole reside on opposite sides of the interface. Due to the energy landscape created by differences in the band structures of the constituent materials, unique effects such as unidirectional exciton transport and excitonic lensing can be observed in lateral heterostructures. This review outlines recent progress in exciton dynamics and spectroscopy of TMD-based lateral heterostructures and offers an outlook on future developments in excitonics in this promising system.</p>

            <p>Coherent control of quantum emitters is essential for scalable quantum photonic technologies. The recently proposed swing-up of quantum emitter (SUPER) scheme enables the coherent preparation of excitons via off-resonant, red-detuned laser pulses, offering highly efficient single-photon generation. We present a systematic study of SUPER excitation applied to a single GaAs quantum dot in a low-Q micropillar cavity. After identifying optimal excitation conditions, we benchmark the SUPER scheme against above-band, p-shell, and two-photon biexciton excitation (TPE). Despite requiring higher excitation powers, SUPER achieves near-unity population inversion ($\sim$95 %) and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}=0.03$), comparable to TPE, while also yielding a shortened exciton decay time ($\sim$200 ps), indicative of direct, efficient exciton preparation. A polarization-resolved analysis reveals that, when both excitation and collection are aligned with the exciton dipole, SUPER results in a highly polarized single-photon emission exceeding resonant TPE saturation by a factor of 1.45. Under optimal excitation conditions, we also observe biexciton preparation via a distinct SUPER resonance, confirmed by unpolarized exciton emission, extended lifetime due to the biexciton-exciton cascade, and biexciton emission, constituting the first experimental demonstrations of biexciton preparation under SUPER. These findings are in good agreement with a proposed four-level theoretical model including the biexciton. We also report that, strikingly, a slight misalignment of laser polarization induces an additional SUPER resonance that selectively populates the orthogonal exciton state without altering the nominal excitation polarization. These findings establish the SUPER scheme as a versatile tool for state-selective exciton and biexciton control, with strong potential for quantum photonic applications.</p>

The recent development of phononic circuits has increased the demand for a fast imaging method based on principles of coherent detection. However, it becomes complicated to perform measurements on a large surface area. Here, we present a frequency-detuned collimated-beam interferometry measurement scheme with in-plane spatial resolution of about 6 um, which can provide information about the phase dynamics of the entire mechanical oscillation cycle on a time scale of a few seconds. We employ a stroboscopic pulse probing method to resolve high-frequency vibrational motion with a standard CMOS camera. We use this setup to image megahertz frequency resonant mode profiles present in a Valley-Hall topological triangular cavity, over an area of more than 20 mm2. We relate the obtained data to numerical simulations of the topological edge modes to reveal the relation between backscattering and the mode profile distribution.

            <p>In this work, we present a theory to address conflicting experimental claims regarding the charge density wave (CDW) state in TiSe$_2$, including whether there is a single or multiple CDW transitions and whether threefold rotation symmetry ($C_3$) is broken. Using a continuum $\boldsymbol{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$ model coupled to the CDW order parameter, we show how commonplace conduction band doping induces a nematic transition from a $C_3$-symmetric $3Q$ CDW to a $C_3$-breaking $3Q$ CDW, which is favored by the large ellipticity of the conduction bands of TiSe$_2$. We also find that a $1Q$ stripe CDW is generically stabilized for sufficiently high electron doping. We then show how both stripe and nematic CDW states emerge self-consistently from a minimal interacting tight-binding model, for both positive and negative initial gaps. Our theory provides a new scenario in which, as temperature is lowered, a second $C_3$-breaking transition may occur or not depending on the doping level, potentially explaining the experimental variability. These predictions can be further verified with a variety of probes including transport, photoemission and tunneling.</p>

            <p>Trigonal-PtBi2 has recently garnered significant interest as it exhibits unique superconducting topological surface states due to electron pairing on Fermi arcs connecting bulk Weyl nodes. Furthermore, topological nodal lines have been predicted in trigonal-PtBi2, and their signature was measured in magnetotransport as a dissipationless, i.e. odd under a magnetic field reversal, anomalous planar Hall effect. Understanding the topological superconducting surface state in trigonal-PtBi2 requires unravelling the intrinsic geometric properties of the normal state electronic wavefunctions and further studies of their hallmarks in charge transport characteristics are needed. In this work, we reveal the presence of a strong dissipative, i.e. even under a magnetic field reversal, planar Hall effect in PtBi2 at low magnetic fields and up to room temperature. This robust response can be attributed to the presence of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi energy. While this effect generally follows the theoretical prediction for a planar Hall effect in a Weyl semimetal, we show that it deviates from theoretical expectations at both low fields and high temperatures. We also discuss the origin of the PHE in our material, and the contributions of both the topological features in PtBi2 and its possible trivial origin. Our results strengthen the topological nature of PtBi2 and the strong influence of quantum geometric effects on the electronic transport properties of the low energy normal state.</p>

            <p>We study the Ising model under a time-varying, but spatially homogeneous, Gaussian random magnetic field. In the Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond the standard analysis of the order parameter by measuring the magnetization probability distribution as a function of temperature and field strength, and by computing the time required for the system to escape from a completely ordered state of the magnetization. We identify three distinct phases: a soft-paramagnetic phase, a soft-ferromagnetic phase and a bona-fide ferromagnetic phase. These soft phases display broad magnetization distributions that tend to limiting forms that remain finite in both height and width in the thermodynamic limit. The transition between the soft-paramagnetic and soft-ferromagnetic phases is a noise-induced transition and, for small field amplitudes, occurs at the critical temperature of the field-free Ising model. The transition from the soft-ferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase occurs at lower temperatures and is discontinuous, yet it does not fall into the conventional first-order class. Instead, it is characterized by a diverging escape time from an ordered magnetization state.</p>

            <h2>Quantum stochastic resonance in a single-photon emitter</h2>

            <p>Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which fluctuations enhance an otherwise weak signal. It has been found in many different systems in paleoclimatology, biology, medicine, and physics. The classical stochastic resonance due to thermal noise has recently been experimentally extended to the quantum regime, where the fundamental randomness of individual quantum events provides the noise source. Here, we demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance in the single-electron tunneling dynamics of a periodically driven single-photon emitter, consisting of a self-assembled quantum dot that is tunnel-coupled to an electron reservoir. Such highly-controllable quantum emitters are promising candidates for future applications in quantum information technologies. We monitor the charge dynamics by resonant optical excitation and identify quantum stochastic resonance with the help of full counting statistics of tunneling events in terms of the Fano factor and extend the statistical evaluation to factorial cumulants to gain a deeper understanding of this far-reaching phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Nonlinear Transport Signatures of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in a Weyl Altermagnet</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yufei Zhao, Zhiqiang Mao, Binghai Yan</p>
            <p>Phase transitions in solids are often accompanied by structural changes, but subtle lattice distortions can remain hidden from conventional crystallographic probes, hindering the identification of the correct order parameters. A case in point is Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a correlated polar ruthenate with well-characterized phase transitions, whose ground state structure has recently become a subject of debate. This uncertainty stems from extremely small atomic displacements ($\sim$0.001 Å) between competing phases, beyond the resolution of X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, or optical second-harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a method to detect hidden symmetry breaking by leveraging nonlinear transport induced by quantum geometry. We show that Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a Weyl chain semimetal in both phases. The low-symmetry phase, classified as an altermagnet by symmetry, features distorted topological surface states that are asymmetric along the polar ($b$) axis. However, the nonrelativistic spin splitting is too weak ($\sim$0.1 meV) to be resolved directly, regarding the altermagnetism. In contrast, Weyl chains generate a large quantum metric at the Fermi surface, leading to nonlinear conductivities that are orders of magnitude stronger in the low-symmetry phase. A longitudinal nonlinear conductivity along the polar axis emerges exclusively in this phase, providing a sensitive probe to qualitatively distinguish it from the high-symmetry structure and demonstrate the emergence of altermangetism, which is confirmed by a recent experiment. Our work establishes a route for identifying hidden symmetry breaking in complex quantum materials through the interplay of crystal symmetry, topology and nonlinear quantum transport.</p>

            <p>We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70°, stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.</p>

            <h2>High-Efficiency Nonrelativistic Charge-Spin Conversion in X-Type Antiferromagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jiabin Wang, Wancheng Zhang, Yong Liu, Rui Xiong, Zhenhua Zhang, Zhihong Lu</p>
            <p>Altermagnets have attracted considerable interest due to the symmetry-induced anisotropic spin splitting while preserving zero net magnetization, which enables efficient generation of spin currents. This work proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents than common altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is controlled by the Néel vector orientation. As a prototype conducting X-type antiferromagnet, the Fermi surface of $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$ exhibits a distinct $d$-wave altermagnetic characteristic, which compresses into a nearly X-shaped configuration. This results in highly efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents, achieving a charge-spin conversion efficiency of up to 90%. Moreover, when the Néel vector tilts to the out-of-plane direction, an in-plane injected charge current can generate a special spin current component with both spin polarization and propagation along the out-of-plane direction, whose charge-spin conversion efficiency substantially exceeds that of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>We study the effects of the electron-electron interactions on the excitonic properties and charge-density modulations in the AB stacked double-layer (DL) graphene, placed in the external gate-potential $V$. The coexistence of the canted antiferromagnetic order and excitonic pairing gap has been studied with the help of the generalized Hubbard model. We calculate the chemical potential $\mu$, the average charge density difference between the layers $\delta{\bar{n}}$, the antiferromagnetic gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and the excitonic order parameters $\Delta_{\sigma}$ in the zero temperature limit. We found that the excitonic pairing order parameter has a larger energy scale than the canted antiferromagnetic gap-function. The charge neutrality, in the DL graphene system, occurs only in the absence of the external gate-potential $V$. Moreover, we have shown that the values of the antiferromagnetic gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and excitonic order parameter $\Delta_{\sigma}$ are always increasing at the large values of inter-layer Coulomb interaction, while they are decreasing for large values of the applied gate-potential $V$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cesar A. Gallegos, Rafael M. Magaldi, Andrew Millis, Steven R. White</p>
            <p>We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.</p>

            <h2>Quantum geometry and impurity sensitivity of superconductors without time-reversal symmetry: application to rhombohedral graphene and altermagnets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Denis Sedov, Mathias S. Scheurer</p>
            <p>Analyzing the consequences of the quantum geometry induced by the momentum dependence of Bloch states has emerged as a very rich and active field in condensed matter physics. For instance, for the superfluid stiffness or the pairing mechanism, these geometric aspects can play an important role. We here demonstrate that quantum geometry can also be essential for the disorder sensitivity of a superconductor, in particular when time-reversal symmetry is broken in the normal-state Bloch Hamiltonian. We derive a general expression for the behavior of the critical temperature $T_c$ involving weighted (anti-)commutators of the superconducting order parameter and impurity matrix elements, which includes both wave-function effects and kinetic pair breaking due to broken time-reversal symmetry in the dispersion. We analyze how the former effects lead to "quantum geometric pair breaking", where any superconductor becomes susceptible to microscopically non-magnetic impurities, and formally relate it to the maximum possible localization of two-particle Wannier states. Further, in the presence of kinetic pair breaking, impurities can also enhance pairing, leading to an overall more complex, non-monotonic behavior of $T_c$ with impurity concentration. We also analyze the fate of finite-momentum pairing. Our results are directly relevant to rhombohedral graphene, twisted MoTe$_2$, and superconducting altermagnets.</p>

            <p>The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Takahiro Chiba, Ryunosuke Suzuki, Takashi Otaki, Hiroaki Matsueda</p>
            <p>We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model. We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy, providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.</p>

            <p>Magnetic topology and its associated emergent phenomena are central to realizing intriguing quantum states and spintronics functionalities. Designing spin textures to achieve strong and distinct electrical responses remains a significant challenge. Layered transition metal dichalcogenides offer a versatile platform for tailoring structural and magnetic properties, enabling access to a wide spectrum of topological magnetic states. Here, we report a domain-wall-driven, large, and tunable topological Hall effect (THE) in a non-centrosymmetric intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides series Fe$_x$TaS$_2$. By systematically varying the Fe intercalation level, we exert precise control over the magnetic ground states, allowing manipulation of the topological Hall effect. Real-space magnetic force microscopy (MFM) provides direct evidence of periodic magnetic stripe domain formation, confirming the microscopic origin of the observed topological transport phenomena. Our findings establish a promising way for tuning the topology of domains to generate substantial electromagnetic responses in layered magnetic materials.</p>

            <h2>Kondo breakdown induced by the non-Hermitian complex hybridization</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kazuki Yamamoto, Masaya Nakagawa, Norio Kawakami</p>
            <p>Recently, a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss has been studied in [Phys. Rev. B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated that the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations counterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body dissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is also known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo breakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson impurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model that provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo breakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact Bethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson mean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for the non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic continuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the analyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\omega$ plane no longer holds.</p>

            <p>A field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) state is an extraordinary phenomenon, hitherto unobserved in metallic frustrated compounds. Recent bulk measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states, potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\mu$SR) technique, applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\mu$SR data indicate that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$ exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B>$B_{c2}$ they yield contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate ($\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3 T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state in a metallic frustrated system.</p>

            <p>A range of of unusual emergent behaviors have been reported in the charge-density wave (CDW) state of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=~$K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals, including a CDW formation process without soft phonons, which points to an unconventional CDW mechanism. Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at $L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening. Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.</p>

            <p>We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional higher-wave-symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$ symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.</p>

In this review, we provide a concise overview of non-relativistic spin splitting in compensated antiferromagnets with various spin configurations, including collinear, coplanar, and non-coplanar spin arrangements. We summarize practical identification guidelines, highlight characteristic features in electronic band structures, and discuss the emerging functionalities, with an emphasis on promising directions for future exploration.</p>

            <p>The origin of the strange metallic behavior observed in a wide range of quantum materials is an open challenge to condensed matter physics. Historically, strange metals were uniquely associated with antiferromagnetic quantum critical points (QCPs), but a new generation of materials reveals their association with uniform order parameters, such as ferromagnetism, valley or nematic order, suggesting a deeper common denominator. At a QCP, order parameter fluctuations are characterized by the dynamical critical exponent $z$, which quantifies the space-time scaling asymmetry. Here, we report the observation of a divergence in the Grüneisen ratio at the QCP of the strange-metal ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ with a dynamical critical exponent $z=3$, signaling that the underlying quantum singularity involves a conserved degree of freedom. Yet the magnetization of this easy-plane ferromagnet is not conserved. We argue that the $z=3$ strange criticality requires a description beyond the Landau paradigm, proposing a link with the gauge modes of the small-to-large Fermi surface transition and the associated gauge charge of the delocalizing heavy electrons.</p>

            <h2>Predictive Indicator of Critical Point in Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Magnetic Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tianyi Zhang, Caihua Wan, Xiufeng Han</p>
            <p>Determining critical points of phase transitions from partial data is essential to avoid abrupt system collapses and reducing experimental or computational costs. However, the complex physical systems and phase transition phenomena have long hindered the development of unified approaches applicable to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions. In this work, we propose predictive indicators to determine critical points in equilibrium and nonequilibrium magnetic systems based on frequency-dependent response function. For equilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching under magnetic field, the static magnetization response function to a perturbing magnetic field diverges at the critical field, serving as a noise-resilient predictive indicator that also reflects the transition order and critical exponents. In contrast, for nonequilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching driven by spin-transfer torque, static response fails to signal criticality. Instead, the dynamic response at ferromagnetic resonance frequency diverges at the critical point, which is also robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate that these static and dynamic indicators can be unified in the frame of first-order linear differential systems, offering a generalizable strategy for predicting criticality in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium transitions.</p>

Here we report a new type of self-poisoning found in poly(lactic acid) (PLA), where a less stable crystal form (alpha') disturbs growth of the stable form (alpha). While alpha requires strict up-down order of the polar chains, alpha' does not, hence is kinetically favoured. Unexpectedly, below the temperature of the growth rate minimum the lamellar thickness increases rather than drops, as in all other reported cases of polymer crystallization with decreasing temperature. A growth rate equation model is developed, giving good match with experiments, but revealing an unexpectedly low fold surface free energy of alpha' form. Due to SP of alpha, most practical fast-cooling processing gives the low-modulus alpha'-form grown close to Tg, explaining generally poor mechanical properties of the bio-friendly PLA.</p>

            <h2>Metallic island array as synthetic quantum matter: fractionalized entropy and thermal transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nitay Hurvitz, Gleb Finkelstein, Eran Sela</p>
            <p>The surprisingly rich physics of a single Coulomb-blockaded metallic island, when coupled to quantum Hall edge channels, is now well established -- giving rise to charge fractionalization and multi-channel quantum impurity behavior. Here, we show that qualitatively new physics emerges in arrays of such elements. We consider a 1D chain of $N$ metallic islands, focusing on thermodynamic signatures such as quantized entropy and anomalous thermal conductance. Universal and robust behavior emerges for energy scales smaller than the charging energy of the islands. In particular, we demonstrate that for the bulk filling factor of $\nu=1$, the islands could support a finite heat flow without temperature difference between them. Upon pinching the array with a quantum point contact, we predict an entropy change that scales with the number of islands as $\Delta S = \frac{1}{2}k_B \log (N+1)$, which can be measured using charge detection. This fractional entropy suggests the emergence of a novel type of excitations in the array.</p>

            <h2>Sub-10 nm Quantification of Spin and Orbital Magnetic Moment Across the Metamagnetic Phase Transition in FeRh Using EMCD</h2>

            <p>Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables element-specific measurement of spin and orbital magnetic moments, analogous to X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). While the EMCD technique offers unmatched spatial resolution, its quantitative accuracy remains under scrutiny, particularly in beam-splitter geometries with convergent probes. Here, we systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative EMCD analysis using the first-order magnetostructural transition in the functional phase-change material FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference. Unlike previous EMCD studies primarily focused on elemental ferromagnets such as Fe, we demonstrate its applicability to a correlated material exhibiting coupled structural and magnetic order. We demonstrate that the extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remains consistent with XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, we observe an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$, which we attribute to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity within the probed volume. Our results confirm that EMCD provides quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments in functional magnetic materials, and allowing the study of interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible to photon-based methods.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vera Mikheeva, Daniele Guerci, Daniel Kaplan, Elio J. König</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent experiments on rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene and the observation of the anomalous Hall effect in a spontaneous spin-valley polarized quarter metal state, we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity for this system in the presence of two types of impurities: weak and dense as well as sparse and strong. Our calculation of $\sigma_{xy}$ is based on the Kubo-Streda diagrammatic approach. In a model with Gaussian disorder applicable to weak dense impurities, this involves all non-crossing diagrams (intrinsic, side-jump and Gaussian skew-scattering contributions) and additionally diagrams with two intersecting impurities, X and $\Psi$, representing diffractive skew-scattering processes. A "Mercedes star" diagram (non-Gaussian skew scattering) is furthermore included to treat in the case of strong, sparse impurities. We supplement our asymptotically exact analytical solutions for an isotropic model without warping effects by semi-numerical calculations accounting perturbatively for warping, which plays a crucial role in the low-energy band structure.</p>

            <h2>Charge-density waves and stripes in quarter metals of graphene heterostructures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sk Asrap Murshed, Bitan Roy</p>
            <p>Motivated by recent experiments, here we identify valley-coherent charge-density wave (VC-CDW) order in the non-degenerate quarter-metal for the entire family of chirally-stacked $n$ layer graphene, encompassing rhombohedral multi-layer, Bernal bilayer, and monolayer cousins. Besides the hallmark broken translational symmetry, yielding a modulated charge-density over an enlarged unit-cell with a characteristic $2{\bf K}$ periodicity, where $\pm {\bf K}$ are the valley momenta, this phase lacks the three-fold ($C_3$) rotational symmetry but only for even integer $n$. The VC-CDW then represents a stripe order, as observed in hexalayer graphene [arXiv:2504.05129], but preserves the $C_3$ symmetry for odd $n$ as observed in trilayer graphene [Nat. Phys. 20, 1413 (2024) and arXiv: 2411.11163]. From a universal Clifford algebraic argument, we establish that the VC-CDW and an anomalous Hall order can lift the residual valley degeneracy of an antiferromagnetically ordered spin-polarized half-metal, when these systems are subject to perpendicular displacement fields, with only the latter one displaying a hysteresis in off-diagonal resistivity, as observed in all the systems with $2 \leq n \leq 6$. We showcase a confluence of VC-CDW and anomalous Hall orders within the quarter-metal, generically displaying a regime of coexistence, separating the pure phases.</p>

            <p>We present a depletion imaging technique to map out the spatial and temporal dependency of the density distribution of an ultracold gas of Rydberg atoms. Locally resolved absorption depletion, observed through differential ground state absorption imaging of a $^{87}\text{Rb}$ cloud in presence and absence of pre-excited Rydberg atoms, reveals their projected two-dimensional distribution. By employing a closed two-level optical transition uncoupled from the Rydberg state, the highly excited atoms are preserved during imaging. We measure the excitation dynamics of the $\vert48S\rangle$ state of $^{87}\text{Rb}$, observing a saturation of the two-dimensional Rydberg density. Such outcome can be explained by the Rydberg blockade effect which prevents resonant excitation of close-by Rydberg atoms due to strong dipolar interactions. By combining the superatom description, where atoms within a blockade radius are represented as collective excitations, with a Monte Carlo sampling, we can quantitatively model the observed excitation dynamics and infer the full three-dimensional distribution of Rydberg atoms, that can serve as a starting point for quantum simulation of many-body dynamics involving Rydberg spin systems.</p>

            <p>We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 uK and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(1)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ uK for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.</p>

            <h2>Modelling multiscale architecture of biofilm extracellular matrix and its role in oxygen transport</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Raghu K. Moorthy, Eoin Casey</p>
            <p>The extracellular matrix of biofilms presents a dense and intricate architecture. Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant 'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations during early stage biofilm development.</p>

            <p>Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computers. One requirement to create a quantum processor is nonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by sandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a Josephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that hinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum necessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead to dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for high-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations using a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator transition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit its thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link employing only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our weak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured anharmonicity of $\alpha/2\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is $\kappa/2\pi = 15 \mathrm{\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium nitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and the fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material interfaces and capacitances. The investigation of small patches of material near the SIT can shed new light on the nature of the transition, including the role of dissipation and finite-size effects.</p>

            <p>Real-valued band structures are foundational to analyzing periodic systems within the Hermitian description and have been experimentally well-established over recent decades. In contrast, non-Hermitian systems exhibit complex band structures where both energy and momentum have imaginary parts, underpinning phenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence that defy conventional Bloch theory. Experimentally mapping these complex bands-relating complex momentum to complex energy-and identifying their associated eigenstates is crucial for understanding these systems but remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a non-Bloch supercell framework designed to overcome this challenge by decoupling Bloch phase control from the imaginary part of momentum. Our method combines an exponent-flattening protocol with twisted boundary conditions, enabling system-size-independent control of imaginary momentum while preserving high-resolution Bloch phase sampling. Implemented in programmable one- and two-dimensional acoustic crystals, our approach acquires momentum-resolved complex energy surfaces and biorthogonal eigenmodes by Green's function this http URL obtained using this framework accurately predict open-boundary spectra and eigenstates, findings we verify through separate open-geometry experiments. Our work provides a broadly applicable experimental toolkit for exploring non-Hermitian band geometry and topology in diverse engineered classical and quantum platforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Renaud A. L. Vallée, Rénal Backov</p>
            <p>We derive an end-to-end framework connecting steady-state photon transport in highly scattering porous slabs to surface-bound photocatalytic rates. Starting from the diffusion approximation (DA) with extrapolated (partial-current) boundary conditions, we solve the finite-slab Green's function with an isotropic internal plane source that rigorously maps external illumination to internal fluence. Using photon units for the fluence rate, Phi(z,lambda) [photons m-2 s-1], the local absorption is qa = mu_a * Phi and the primary carrier/radical generation is G = phi_int * qa. Site-limited and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics are driven by G and closed via an accessible surface per macroscopic volume, S_accessible, yielding intrinsic volumetric (per-volume) and areal (per-area) rate constants. We then specialize to air-core/silica-shell monoliths whose shells host anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs): shell refractive indices are calculated by Maxwell-Garnett/Bruggeman mixing; scattering is obtained from Mie theory (PyMieScatt); absorption follows mu_a = n_NP * sigma_abs with n_NP set by NP packing fraction in the shell. The exact slab solution reduces to a compact, design-useful predictor - our Eq. (14) - in a controlled asymptotic that clarifies when the rate scales as l*l/L (strongly diffusive, l << L) versus proportional to l (optically thin, l >> L). We detail measurement and validation protocols (diffuse R/T inversion of mu_s' and mu_a on the same slab, boundary extrapolation accuracy, lateral-loss control) drawing on prior art, and provide a turnkey recipe to compute rates for NP packing-fraction series. The result is a reproducible workflow that preserves design simplicity while resting on a rigorous finite-slab solution.</p>

            <p>Underground storage of hydrogen and ammonia in geological formations is essential for renewable energy integration, but salt precipitation during gas injection may threaten storage performance. While extensively studied for CO2 systems, precipitation mechanisms in hydrogen-brine and ammonia-brine systems remain poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive microfluidic investigation of salt crystallization during hydrogen injection into saline and ammonia-containing brines using high-pressure microfluidics. We conducted 81 high-pressure experiments systematically varying brine composition (1-5 mol/kg NaCl), chemical additives (surfactants, alcohols, ammonia), and hydrogen flow rates (200-1300 mL/min). Quantitative image analysis reveals that hydrogen-induced precipitation differs fundamentally from CO2 systems. Hydrogen drives physical precipitation via evaporation and capillary trapping, producing discrete, localized deposits. In contrast, CO2-ammonia systems generate extensive reactive precipitation of ammonium bicarbonate with interconnected crystal networks. Interfacial tension (IFT) controls both residual brine distribution and final crystal coverage: high-IFT fluids form large, interconnected brine pools promoting extensive crystallization, while low-IFT fluids create isolated pools reducing crystal coverage by 50\%. Alcohol and surfactant additives suppress precipitation by enhancing brine mobility, whereas ammonia paradoxically increases crystal fractions despite lower IFT. Higher flow rates accelerate crystallization across all compositions, enabling operational mitigation strategies. and demonstrate that gas-specific, rather than CO2-analog, risk assessments are essential for underground hydrogen storage design. The effectiveness of chemical additives offers promising pathways for near-wellbore protection in underground hydrogen storage operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yoonhak Nam, Kazuyuki Sekizawa</p>
            <p>This work aims to elucidate whether the PBF process alone (i.e., without invoking other processes like direct Urca) can explain the observed rapid cooling of Cas~A NS, by incorporating the significant uncertainties in both $q$ and the $^{3}\text{P}_{2}$ pairing gap function into an optimization of cooling models against the Cas~A NS data. To this end, we introduce a novel parametrization of the pairing gap, in which each parameter has a direct physical meaning, and perform systematic parameter-space exploration with the BSk24 equation of state (EoS). Using a newly-developed Fortran-based cooling code coupled to Optuna's TPE algorithm, we conduct both single-objective ($\chi^2$ only) and multi-objective ($\chi^2$ + slope difference) optimizations under identical conditions. By optimizing the neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap parameters to best reproduce the Cas~A NS observational data during repeated neutron-star cooling simulations, we obtain reasonably-behaving neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap functions with maximum values of $\Delta_\text{max}\approx$\,0.5--0.6\,MeV. Fixing $M=1.4\,M_\odot$, increasing $q$ progressively drives the optimized gap and the critical temperature $T_\text{c}$ profiles toward smoother, more traditional shapes and improves agreement with the observational data; the PBF efficiency factor of $q\gtrsim0.4$ reproduces the Cas~A NS slope well, whereas $q\simeq0.19$ remains insufficient. Our results support previous indications that enhanced PBF efficiency or additional rapid-cooling channels may be required to fully explain the Cas~A NS observational data. The new parametrization not only improves interpretability but also provides a framework for future Bayesian inference and machine-learning applications. Extensions of this work will further advance the systematic study of dense-matter physics with neutron-star cooling. (Shortened due to the arXiv words limit.)</p>

            <p>Black holes exist all over our Universe, possessing a very wide range of masses. At the moment, they serve as a probe to test general relativity at astrophysical scales, but in the future they may also give us information about gravity at the microscale. Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties, such as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering black holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in statistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system, several questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be explained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these questions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored at the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this connection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved spacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged self-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of state which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes and self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase transitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the formalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes. Namely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black holes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius. We construct ensembles of a self-gravitating matter thin shell, both in anti-de Sitter and in asymptotically flat spaces, in order to understand the thermodynamic features of the shell and the possible phase transitions to black hole configurations.</p>

            <p>Kinetically constrained models (KCMs) are interacting particle systems introduced in the '80s by physicists to have accessible stochastic models with glassy-type dynamics. The key mechanism behind the complex evolution of these otherwise simple models is the so-called dynamical facilitation, a feature embedded into the models via appropriate kinetic constraints. KCMs are reversible with respect to a Bernoulli product measure, and the analysis of their stationary evolution has witnessed significant progress in the last decade. Unfortunately, in the interesting regime when the equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices is small, many fundamental questions concerning the non-stationary evolution of even the simplest models remain unsolved. In this paper, we discuss some of these questions, along with partial new results and conjectures, for the one facilitated model and its variants, as well as for the biased annihilating branching process.</p>

            <p>Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \approx 11\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \approx 2\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlos Escudero, Helder Rojas</p>
            <p>Diffusion theory establishes a fundamental connection between stochastic differential equations and partial differential equations. The solution of a partial differential equation known as the Fokker-Planck equation describes the probability density of the stochastic process that solves a corresponding stochastic differential equation. The kinetic interpretation of noise refers to a prospective notion of stochastic integration that would connect a stochastic differential equation with a Fokker-Planck equation consistent with the Fick law of diffusion, without introducing correction terms in the drift. This work is devoted to identifying the precise conditions under which such a correspondence can occur. One of these conditions is a structural constraint on the diffusion tensor, which severely restricts its possible form and thereby renders the kinetic interpretation of noise a non-generic situation. This point is illustrated through a series of examples. Furthermore, the analysis raises additional questions, including the possibility of defining a stochastic integral inspired by numerical algorithms, the behavior of stochastic transport equations in heterogeneous media, and the development of alternative models for anomalous diffusion. All these topics are addressed using stochastic analytical tools similar to those employed to study the main problem: the existence of the kinetic interpretation of noise.</p>

            <p>Living systems must maintain robust biochemical function despite fluctuations that span a wide range of timescales. Biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been shown to buffer concentration fluctuations, but the principles governing their dynamic regulation remain unclear. We address this by probing the response of LLPS to oscillatory perturbations that mimic fluctuations across different timescales, establishing the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of concentration buffering by condensates. We find that condensates act as frequency-selective filters: the perturbed dilute phase behaves as a high-pass filter, while the dense phase attenuates both low- and high-frequency perturbations. We establish quantitative links between LLPS parameters including interaction strength, droplet size, and molecular diffusivity, and the timescale range over which condensates effectively buffer concentration fluctuations.

            <p>We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for constructing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. Assuming reflection positivity, we prove the equivalence between the non-degeneracy of the ground state on the sphere and the local-indistinguishability of local ground states of a frustration-free Hamiltonian. We apply the Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) reconstruction to construct the local symmetric operator algebras, which characterize the emergent categorical symmetry in the ground states.</p>

            <p>Voltage control of magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) induced by charge accumulation is typically considered as an ultrafast process, enabling energy-efficient and high-speed magnetization switching in spintronic devices. In this work, we investigate the real-time dynamics of VCMA-assisted switching of magnetic tunnel junctions via relaxation in a magnetic field. We show that device-dependent charging effects and magnetic granularity in the free layer limit the switching speed at applied voltages close to the critical switching threshold. Increasing the voltage or the applied magnetic field reduces the incubation delay and total switching time to below a few ns. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating the finite charging times of the tunnel junction and the granularity of the magnetic film reproduce the experimental results, providing critical insights into optimizing VCMA-driven magnetization control for memory and logic applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Troy Criss, Ahmed Sidi El Valli, Naomi Li, Andrew Haas, Andrew D. Kent</p>
            <p>We demonstrate a method to generate application-ready truly random bits from a magnetic tunnel junction driven by a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We implement a real-time feedback loop that stabilizes the switching probability near 50\% and apply an XOR operation, both on the FPGA, to suppress short-term correlations, together mitigating long-term drift and bias in the bitstream. This combined approach enables NIST-compliant random bit generation at 5~Mb/s without post-processing, providing a practical hardware solution for fast and reliable true random number generation. Beyond cryptographic applications, these capabilities open opportunities for stochastic hardware accelerators, probabilistic computing, and large-scale modeling where real-time access to unbiased randomness is essential.</p>

            <h2>Theta-term in Russian Doll Model: phase structure, quantum metric and BPS multifractality</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alexander Gorsky, Ilya Lyubimov</p>
            <p>We investigate the phase structure of the deterministic and disordered versions of the Russian Doll Model (RDM), which is a generalization of Richardson model of superconductivity in a finite system with time-reversal symmetry breaking parameter $\theta$. It is one of the simplest examples of the cyclic RG where $\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model is integrable and shares the same Bethe Ansatz (BA) equations with the inhomogeneous twisted XXX spin chain. We analyze the quantum metric, the Berry curvature, and the fractal dimension in the sector with a single Cooper pair. A rich phase structure in the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane is found, where $\gamma \log N$ quantifies the hopping term. For the deterministic RDM we clearly identify the extended domain of non-ergodic multifractal phase on the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane supporting the reentrance transitions between the localized, ergodic, and multifractal phases. We find the pattern of phase transitions in the global charge $Q(\theta,\gamma)$, which arises from the BA equation. In particular, in the multifractal phase in the deterministic model $Q(\gamma)$ exhibits the analogue of "charge concentration" and fortuity phenomena discussed in the context of black hole microstates at finite $N$. The BA equations in RDM exactly coincide with the equations defining the ground states in the theory on the worldvolume of the vortex strings in $N_F=2N_C$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD at a strong coupling point $\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2}=0$ with identification $\theta_{RDM}= \theta_{4D}-\pi$. We conjecture that the Hamiltonian of the RDM model describes the mixing in particular 2d-4d BPS sector of the Hilbert space. Our findings provide an example of the BPS multifractality regime for the probe operator in the sector of Hilbert space, and we comment on the possible application to dense QCD with $\theta$ term.</p>

            <p>We propose a laboratory-scale experiment to locally measure the general relativistic frame-dragging effect on Earth using the macroscopic quantum properties of a novel superfluid $^4$He single Josephson junction gyrometer. We derive the frame-dragging and related geodetic and Thomas effects in the superfluid gyrometer and present a procedure for their experimental measurement. We compute the expected thermal noise floor and find that very high sensitivity can be expected at millikelvin temperatures, where near-future Josephson junctions using nanoporous 2D materials are expected to operate. Assuming utilization of the lowest mechanical loss materials, we find a noise spectral density of $5\times 10^{-17}$ rads/s/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 mK, which is sufficient to resolve the frame-dragging rate to 0.2% within one second of measurement, giving a rotational sensitivity of 1 revolution in 4 Byrs. This extreme sensitivity to rotation corresponds to a measurement of proper time differences as small as $10^{-35}$ s.</p>

            <h2>Field theory for optimal signal propagation in ResNets</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kirsten Fischer, David Dahmen, Moritz Helias</p>
            <p>Residual networks have significantly better trainability and thus performance than feed-forward networks at large depth. Introducing skip connections facilitates signal propagation to deeper layers. In addition, previous works found that adding a scaling parameter for the residual branch further improves generalization performance. While they empirically identified a particularly beneficial range of values for this scaling parameter, the associated performance improvement and its universality across network hyperparameters yet need to be understood. For feed-forward networks, finite-size theories have led to important insights with regard to signal propagation and hyperparameter tuning. We here derive a systematic finite-size field theory for residual networks to study signal propagation and its dependence on the scaling for the residual branch. We derive analytical expressions for the response function, a measure for the network's sensitivity to inputs, and show that for deep networks the empirically found values for the scaling parameter lie within the range of maximal sensitivity. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the optimal scaling parameter that depends only weakly on other network hyperparameters, such as the weight variance, thereby explaining its universality across hyperparameters. Overall, this work provides a theoretical framework to study ResNets at finite size.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pritam Bhattacharyya, Abdul Basit, Thorben Petersen, Stephan Rachel, Satoshi Nishimoto, Liviu Hozoi</p>
            <p>The detection of considerable spin frustration in honeycomb cobalt oxide compounds indicates the presence of sizable Kitaev interactions in these systems, enlarging the pool of Kitaev spin liquid candidates. Several key questions remain to be answered, such as the magnitude of Kitaev couplings in cobaltates and how to engineer those, by either chemical or physical means. Analyzing the quantum chemistry of interacting magnetic moments in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a representative $LS$-coupled $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$ Co$^{2+}$ oxide, we find that the Kitaev and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interactions are substantial and antiferromagnetic but somewhat weaker than the Heisenberg contribution. Except $\Gamma'$, all nearest-neighbor couplings are mainly determined by Coulomb exchange, different from current representations of anisotropic interaction terms. This highlights the limits of existing anisotropic models and the need for systematic wave-function quantum chemical studies to clarify exchange mechanisms in Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets and the way of tuning intersite couplings towards the Kitaev spin liquid ground state.</p>

            <h2>Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tan Van Vu, Keiji Saito</p>
            <p>Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In the context of cooling, the unattainability principle of the third law of thermodynamics asserts that infinite "resources" are needed to reach absolute zero. However, the precise identification of relevant resources and how they jointly constrain achievable error remains unclear within the frameworks of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics. In this work, we introduce the concept of separated states, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states, and formulate the corresponding thermokinetic cost and error, thereby establishing a unifying framework for a broad class of thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between time, cost, and error for thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau\mathcal{C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yasamin Mardani, Rodrigo A. Pimenta, Jesko Sirker</p>
            <p>It is well-known that the standard bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold for non-Hermitian systems in which also new phenomena such as exceptional points do occur. Here we study, mostly by analytical means, a paradigmatic one-dimensional non-Hermitian model with dimerization, asymmetric hopping, and imaginary staggered potentials. We present analytical solutions for the singular-value and the eigensystem of this model with both open and closed boundary conditions. We explicitly demonstrate that the proper bulk-boundary correspondence is between topological winding numbers in the periodic case and singular values, {\it not eigenvalues}, in the open case. These protected singular values are connected to hidden edge modes which only become exact zero-energy eigenmodes in the semi-infinite chain limit. We also show that a non-trivial topology leads to protected eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we find that the model has a so far overlooked phase where exceptional points become dense in the thermodynamic limit. This phase shows unusual hyper-ballistic transport properties with a dynamical critical exponent $z=1/2$.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lorenzo Monacelli, Antonio Siciliano, Nicola Marzari</p>
            <p>The numerical solution of the many-body problem of interacting electrons and ions is a key challenge in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science. Traditional methods to solve the multi-component quantum Hamiltonian are usually specialized for one kind of particles -- electrons or ions -- and can suffer from a methodological gap when applied to the other ones. This work extends the self-consistent harmonic approximation, a proven successful technique for simulating quantum ions at finite temperatures in anharmonic crystals, to electrons. The approach minimizes the total free energy by optimizing an ansatz density matrix, solving a fermionic self-consistent harmonic Hamiltonian on a curved manifold parametrized through a neural network. This approach preserves an analytical expression for entropy, enabling the direct computation of free energies and phase diagrams of materials. By benchmarking this technique across several prototypical cases -- a double-well potential, the hydrogen atom, and the H$_2$ dissociation -- we demonstrate it can address both the ground- and excited-state properties of electronic systems, capture quantum tunneling and static electronic correlations, thereby providing a unified quantum framework of electrons and atomic nuclei.</p>

            <p>Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</p>

            <p>Frustration of long-range order via lattice geometries serves to amplify fluctuations of the order parameter and generate unconventional ground states that are highly sensitive to perturbations. Traditionally, this concept of geometric frustration is used to engineer unconventional magnetic states in a variety of materials; however, the charge degree of freedom and bond order can be similarly frustrated. Finding materials that host both frustrated magnetic and bond networks holds promise for engineering structural and magnetic states with the potential of coupling to one another via either the magnetic sector (via magnetic field) or via the lattice sector (via strain). In this paper, we identify an unusual instance of this coexistence in the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic compounds $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ ($Ln$ = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd). These compounds feature two-dimensional planes of unique trigonal-planar CdP$_3$ units that manifest an underlying bond instability with its long-range ordering frustrated via emergent kagome ice bond correlations. Our results establish $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ as a rare class of materials where frustrated magnetism across a tunable rare-earth triangular network is embedded within a dopable semiconductor with a frustrated bond order instability.</p>

            <p>Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency {\xi}JDL of Si largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overturns the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies.</p>

            <p>There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.</p>

            <p>Two-dimensional moiré materials are formed by artificially stacking atomically thin monolayers. A wealth of correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered via precise choice of stacking geometry. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry. An important open question is how atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moiré geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist-untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in $2^\circ$ and $57^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. Upon above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of $0.6^\circ$, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moiré phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moiré periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moiré potential that shapes excitons, polarons, and correlation-driven behaviors</p>

            <p>Driven systems offer the potential to realize a wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena that are inaccessible in static systems, such as the discrete time crystals. Time rondeau crystals with a partial temporal order have been proposed as a distinctive prethermal phase of matter in systems driven by structured random protocols. Yet, heating is inevitable in closed systems and time rondeau crystals eventually melt. We introduce dissipation to counteract heating and demonstrate stable time rondeau crystals, which persist indefinitely, in a many-body interacting system. A key ingredient is synchronization in the non-interacting limit, which allows for stable time rondeau order without generating excessive heating. The presence of many-body interaction competes with synchronization and a de-synchronization phase transition occurs at a finite interaction strength. This transition is well captured via a linear stability analysis of the underlying stochastic processes.</p>

Existing strategies present significant challenges, among which the use of multiple subunit types or the precise control of their shape and mechanics. Here we introduce an alternative approach based on identical subunits whose interactions promote crystals, but also favor crystalline defects. We theoretically show that topological restrictions on the scope of these defects in large assemblies imply that the assembly size is controlled by the magnitude of the defect-inducing interaction. Using DNA origami, we experimentally demonstrate both size and shape control in two-dimensional disk- and fiber-like assemblies. Our basic concept of defect engineering could be generalized well beyond these simple examples, and thus provide a broadly applicable scheme to control self-assembly.</p>

            <p>The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</p>

            <p>High 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices is a critical parameter to keep under control in the design of complex circuits for low temperatures applications. Current models predict the 1/f noise to scale linearly with temperature, and gate oxide defects are expected to freeze out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly observed that 1/f noise deviates from the predicted behaviour and that gate oxide defects are still active around 4.2 K, producing random telegraph noise. In this paper, we probe single gate oxide defects in 2500 nMOS devices down to 5 K in order to investigate the origin of 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices. From our results, it is clear that the number of defects active at cryogenic temperatures resulting in random telegraph noise is larger than at 300 K. Threshold voltage shifts due to charged defects are shown to be exponentially distributed, with different modalities across temperatures and biases: from monomodal at 300 K to trimodal below 100 K. The third mode is interpreted in the framework of percolation theory. By fitting these distributions, it is shown that more than 80% of the detected defects belongs to the oxide bulk. Afterwards, starting from the raw data in time domain, we reconstruct the low frequency noise spectra, highlighting the contributions of defects belonging to different branches and, therefore, to different oxide layers. This analysis shows that, although interface traps and large defects associated with the third mode are the main sources of 1/f noise at 5 K, bulk oxide defects still contribute significantly to low-frequency noise at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that defect time constants and step heights are uncorrelated, proving that elastic tunnelling model for charge trapping is not accurate.</p>

            <h2>Tracking shear mode dynamics across the glass transition in a 2D colloidal system</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jimin Bai, Peter Keim, Matteo Baggioli</p>
            <p>Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. Moreover, this phenomenon has been never tested across a continuous glass transition between a liquid phase and a glassy state with large but finite viscosity. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap opens continuously at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. By extracting the instantaneous shear velocity from the experimental data, we uncover a shear relaxation time exhibiting a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence characteristic of glass-forming materials, accurately described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation. Our results confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework and highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.</p>

            <p>Lanthanides are nowadays extensively used to investigate the properties of strongly correlated matter. Nevertheless, exploiting the Zeeman manifold of a lanthanide atom ground state is challenging due to the unavoidable presence of depolarization collisions. Here we demonstrate that in the case of the thulium atom, it is possible to suppress this depolarization by a factor of 1000 with a carefully tuned magnetic field thus opening the way for the efficient use of the Zeeman manifold in quantum simulations.</p>

            <h2>Compressed self-avoiding walks in two and three dimensions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> C J Bradly, N R Beaton, A L Owczarek</p>
            <p>We consider the phase transition induced by compressing a self-avoiding walk in a slab where the walk is attached to both walls of the slab in two and three dimensions, and the resulting phase once the polymer is compressed. The process of moving between a stretched situation where the walls pull apart to a compressed scenario is a phase transition with some similarities to that induced by pulling and pushing the end of the polymer. However, there are key differences in that the compressed state is expected to behave like a lower dimensional system, which is not the case when the force pushes only on the endpoint of the polymer. We use scaling arguments to predict the exponents both of those associated with the phase transition and those in the compressed state and find good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</p>

            <h2>Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Christian F. Schmidt, Simon Brunner, Stefan Floerchinger</p>
            <p>We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Simone Marcorini, Rocco Pomodoro, Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi</p>
            <p>Phase change materials are exploited in non-volatile electronic memories and photonic devices that rely on a fast and reversible transformation between the amorphous and crystalline phase upon heating. The recrystallization of the amorphous phase at the operation conditions of the memories occurs in the supercooled liquid phase above the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The dynamics of the supercooled liquid is thus of great relevance for the operation of the devices and, close to $T_g$, also for the structural relaxations of the glass that affect the performances of the memories. Information on the atomic dynamics is provided by the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and by the viscosity ($\eta$) which are, however, both difficult to be measured experimentally at the operation conditions of the devices due to the fast crystallization. In this work, we leverage a machine learning interatomic potential for the flagship phase change compound compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ to compute $\eta$, $D$ and the $\alpha$-relaxation time in a wide temperature range from 1200 K to about 100 K above $T_g$. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations allowed quantifying the fragility of the liquid and the occurrence of a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation between $\eta$ and $D$ in the supercooled phase. Isoconfigurational analysis provided a visualization of the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities responsible for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. The analysis revealed that the regions of most mobile atoms are related to the presence of Ge atoms with particular local environments.</p>

            <h2>Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Domantas Burba, Gediminas Juzeliūnas</p>
            <p>We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</p>

            <p>The delafossite-like compound NaYbO$_2$ hosts a triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments and is a promising candidate for the realization of a quantum spin liquid ground state -- an exotic, quantum-disordered magnetic phase featuring long-range entanglement of spins. Tuning this system away from this quantum-disordered regime toward classical order or spin freezing is a powerful approach to shed light on the nature of the parent ground state. Here we leverage the substitution of nonmagnetic Lu$^{3+}$ onto the Yb$^{3+}$ sites to study the effects of magnetic disorder in NaYbO$_2$ using low-temperature ac susceptibility, heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our $\mu$SR measurements reveal resilient, correlated magnetic fluctuations that persist to at least 15\% dilution, precluding conventional spin freezing and magnetic inhomogeneity. Heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility resolve a rapid suppression of the field-induced ``up-up-down'' magnetic order upon dilution and a crossover in the power-law behavior of the low-temperature magnetic excitations associated with the zero-field quantum disordered ground state. Taken together, these results support the notion of a robust network of entangled moments in NaYbO$_2$, and provides experimental validation of several models of a Heisenberg triangular lattice antiferromagnet in the presence of disorder.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hidetoshi Nishimori, Masayuki Ohzeki, Manaka Okuyama</p>
            <p>Temperature chaos is a striking phenomenon in spin glasses, where even slight changes in temperature lead to a complete reconfiguration of the spin state. Another intriguing effect is the reentrant transition, in which lowering the temperature drives the system from a ferromagnetic phase into a less ordered spin-glass or paramagnetic phase. In the present paper, we reveal an unexpected connection between these seemingly unrelated phenomena in the finite-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses by introducing a generalized formulation that incorporates correlations among disorder variables. Assuming the existence of a spin glass phase at finite temperature, we establish that temperature chaos arises as a logical consequence of reentrance in the Edwards-Anderson model. Our findings uncover a previously hidden mathematical structure relating reentrance and temperature chaos, offering a new perspective on the physics of spin glasses beyond the mean-field theory.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> R. Moola, A. Mckenna, M. Hilke</p>
            <p>Topological invariants, such as the winding number, the Chern number, and the Zak phase, characterize the topological phases of bulk materials. Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however, in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants, such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments, we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding topological properties in one-dimensional systems.</p>

            <p>We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Byjesh N. Radhakrishnan, Francesco Serafin, Thomas L. Schmidt, Étienne Fodor</p>
            <p>In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.</p>

            <h2>Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Olai B. Mykland, Zhao Zhang</p>
            <p>Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they represent exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state (PEPS), emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents of a $q$-deformation phase transition.</p>

            <p>Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</p>

            <h2>Quantifying when hyperuniformity of a many-particle system leads to uniformity across length scales</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Carlo Vanoni, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato</p>
            <p>Hyperuniform systems are distinguished by an unusually strong suppression of large-scale density fluctuations and, consequently, display a high degree of uniformity at the largest length scales. In some cases, however, enhanced uniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small length scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems, where class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively. We utilize the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window of radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic large-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We find, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals, disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a faster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by corrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the highest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class II systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by logarithmic $1/\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local uniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an asymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\alpha}$, $0 < \alpha < 1$, implying, curiously, an intermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides insight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative of large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of hyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local uniformity.</p>

However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered termination with a varying density of surface tin vacancies. This work establishes heuristics for identifying variable surface disorder using photoemission, an important prerequisite to experimentally establishing the behavior of momentum-space topological surface features subject to variable surface disorder on a single cleave.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas M. Michelitsch, Alejandro P. Riascos</p>
            <p>We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.</p>

This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</p>

            <p>Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is the most commonly used method in electrochemistry to characterize electrochemical reactions, usually involving macroscopic electrodes. Here we demonstrate a novel optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection (TIR) illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer (PNP-BV) model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring, and potentially single-molecule electrochemistry.</p>

In this work, we highlight advances in modeling local disorder using polymorphous and anharmonic frameworks, showing how these methods explain experimental observations and predict new trends. We emphasize the role of disorder in the breakdown of the phonon quasiparticle picture and in modulating electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions, particularly in soft, anharmonic phases of matter, with significant effects on electrical and thermal transport.

            <p>We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order.

            <p>We present an exact solution for the real-time dynamics following a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state in an integrable system. Although equilibration is expected in this setting because the TPQ state already encodes the thermal expectation values of all conserved quantities, the approach to equilibrium shows highly nontrivial coherent dynamics. In the spin-1/2 XX chain, local observables become stationary at their thermal values after dephasing, while the entanglement entropy exhibits a characteristic double-plateau structure. We obtain this behavior exactly using three complementary approaches: two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory (CFT) on the Klein bottle, an exact numerical evolution based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonic entanglement evolution is a macroscopic manifestation of the coherent dephasing of anomalous pairing correlations in the initial TPQ state.</p>

When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.</p>

            <p>We investigate the critical properties of kinetic continuous opinion dynamics using deep learning techniques. The system consists of $N$ continuous spin variables in the interval $[-1,1]$. Dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, accurately identifying the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and allows estimation of critical exponents. Additionally, variational autoencoders are implemented to study the phase transition through the loss function, which behaves as an order parameter. A correlation function between real and reconstructed data is defined and found to be universal at the critical point.</p>

            <h2>Raman Digital Twin of Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johnathan Kowalski, Liangbo Liang</p>
            <p>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation.</p>

            <p>High-performance, low-power transistors are core components of advanced integrated circuits, and the ultimate limitation of Moore's law has made the search for new alternative pathways an urgent priority. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become the most promising exploration target due to their exceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve the required on-state current of 900 {\mu}A/{\mu}m under low operating voltages of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the channel length is 7 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope of 2D high-performance transistors.</p>

            <p>Electronic devices are engineered at increasingly smaller length scales; new metrologies to understand nanoscale thermodynamics are needed. Temperature and pressure are fundamental thermodynamic quantities whose nanoscale measurement is challenging as physical contact inevitably perturbs the system. Here we demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures. KDTh detects local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline samples by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). We map lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe across the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature sensitivity is 2.2 K/$\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission electron microscopy. KDTh can operate in both transmission (transmission Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD) modes.</p>

            <h2>Self-Organization and Cyclic Positioning of Active Condensates</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hossein Vahid, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma</p>
            <p>Active transport of biomolecular condensates and cell migration in collectives are fundamental to development, homeostasis, and processes such as cancer progression, wound healing, and infection response. Yet how these assemblies are positioned, regulated, and driven through cycles of dissolution and reassembly is not fully understood. We address this using a model of attractive active Brownian particles (ABPs). Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that these particles undergo liquid-gas phase separation, and spatially varying activity fields induce striking emergent dynamics. Droplets migrate up activity gradients, and above a critical activity, they fragment into a gas phase. The gas then migrates down the gradient, and droplets reassemble, yielding robust positioning cycles. This emergent condensate cycle arises without biochemical feedback loops and relies only on the interplay of attractions, motility, and gradients. In binary mixtures of active-passive particles, differential cohesion leads to self-sorting of particles, where strongly-cohesive ABPs compact into dense cores surrounded by peripheries enriched with weakly-cohesive passive particles. The passive particles stabilize the dynamic clusters of ABPs, and they migrate toward high-activity regions. Our findings suggest a generic mechanism for spatial control and turnover of condensates in biology.</p>

            <p>Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a >10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessia Valzelli, Francesco Mattiotti, Jianshu Cao, G. Luca Celardo</p>
            <p>Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB) containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes, and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to 80%. We also considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices.</p>

            <h2>Energy-based opinion on the correlation between stress drop and rupture speed</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shiqing Xu</p>
            <p>Stress drop $\Delta\tau$ and rupture speed $V_r$ are two important earthquake source parameters that control the characteristics of rupture process and the associated ground motion. However, how the two parameters correlate with one another is not fully clear and sometimes can be controversial. Here I propose using the energy balance relation derived from fracture mechanics to understand the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. The central idea is to explore the balance between fracture energy $G_c$ and dynamic energy release rate $G_d$ (which itself is a function of $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$) under various conditions of $G_c$. Using averaged values of $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$ for comparison, it is shown that near constant $G_c$ can yield a positive correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$, whereas variable $G_c$ dependent on space, time or other factors may cause a negative correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. These results suggest a need to examine the condition of other factors (such as $G_c$) when evaluating the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. Extra issues can complicate the evaluation of the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$ when rupture process is inferred from far-field observations, accompanied by strong spatiotemporal variation, or followed by additional phases, which should be investigated by future studies.</p>

            <h2>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tomotaka Kuwahara</p>
            <p>Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley--Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay with respect to distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with respect to the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been believed to hold for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement can exist due to the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the entanglement Hamiltonian or Hamiltonian of mean force. As an outcome of our analyses, we improve the prior clustering theorem for bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</p>

            <h2>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haifeng Tang, Shreya Vardhan, Jinzhao Wang</p>
            <p>We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times. Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri</p>
            <p>We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and developing a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; for this they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.</p>

            <p>We investigate transformer-based language models, including RoBERTa, T5, Llama-3, and MatSciBERT, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual descriptions. The inputs encode key material features, such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, and other structural and electronic properties. Unlike shallow machine learning models, which require extensive feature engineering, or Graph Neural Networks, which rely on graph representations derived from atomic coordinates, pretrained language models can process textual inputs directly, eliminating the need for manual feature preprocessing or structure-based encoding. Material descriptions were constructed in two formats: structured strings with a consistent template and natural language narratives generated via the ChatGPT API. Each model was augmented with a custom regression head and finetuned for band gap prediction task. Language models of different architectures and parameter sizes were all able to predict band gaps from human-readable text with strong accuracy, achieving MAEs in the range of 0.25-0.33 eV, highlighting the success of this approach for scientific regression tasks. Finetuned Llama-3, with 1.2 billion parameters, achieved the highest accuracy (MAE 0.248 eV, R2 0.891). MatSciBERT, pretrained on materials science literature, reached comparable performance (MAE 0.288 eV, R2 0.871) with significantly fewer parameters (110 million), emphasizing the importance of domain-specific pretraining. Attention analysis shows that both models selectively focus on compositional and spin-related features while de-emphasizing geometric features, reflecting the difficulty of capturing spatial information from text. These results establish that pretrained language models can effectively extract complex feature-property relationships from textual material descriptions.</p>

Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</p>

            <p>Deep generative models have become ubiquitous due to their ability to learn and sample from complex distributions. Despite the proliferation of various frameworks, the relationships among these models remain largely unexplored, a gap that hinders the development of a unified theory of AI learning. We address two central challenges: clarifying the connections between different deep generative models and deepening our understanding of their learning mechanisms. We focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), known for their universal approximation capabilities for discrete distributions. By introducing a reciprocal space formulation, we reveal a connection between RBMs, diffusion processes, and coupled Bosons. We show that at initialization, the RBM operates at a saddle point, where the local curvature is determined by the singular values, whose distribution follows the Marcenko-Pastur law and exhibits rotational symmetry. During training, this rotational symmetry is broken due to hierarchical learning, where different degrees of freedom progressively capture features at multiple levels of abstraction. This leads to a symmetry breaking in the energy landscape, reminiscent of Landau theory. This symmetry breaking in the energy landscape is characterized by the singular values and the weight matrix eigenvector matrix. We derive the corresponding free energy in a mean-field approximation. We show that in the limit of infinite size RBM, the reciprocal variables are Gaussian distributed. Our findings indicate that in this regime, there will be some modes for which the diffusion process will not converge to the Boltzmann distribution. To illustrate our results, we trained replicas of RBMs with different hidden layer sizes using the MNIST dataset. Our findings bridge the gap between disparate generative frameworks and also shed light on the processes underpinning learning in generative models.</p>

            <p>We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</p>

            <p>The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a Chern-Simons topological term. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the radiative corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the theory is unitary at the tree level.</p>

            <p>Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Holger Grosshans, Gizem Ozler, Simon Jantač</p>
            <p>Triboelectric charging of insulating particles through contact is critical in diverse physical and engineering processes, from dust storms and volcanic eruptions to industrial powder handling. However, many experiments over the years have consistently revealed counterintuitive charging patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a stochastic scaling model (SSM) for particle charging that unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single theoretical framework. The model grounds in a physics-based stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge measured in a highly-controlled reference experiment. To test the SSM, we implemented it in an open-source Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver. When simulating 300 000 insulating particles transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows, the SSM takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SSM offers a physically grounded route to large-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> P. George Christopher, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay)</p>
            <p>No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</p>

            <h2>Self-Enhancing Halite Growth Creates Secondary Porous Networks During CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mohammad Nooraiepour, Mohammad Masoudi, Hannelore Derluyn, Pascale Senechal, Peter Moonen, Helge Hellevang</p>
            <p>Salt precipitation during CO2 injection into saline aquifers obstructs flow-controlling pore throats and reduces permeability, yet reactive transport models assume salt forms dispersed, non-porous crystals with minimal flow impact. We demonstrate that halite instead creates three-dimensional porous networks with 40% internal porosity through self-enhancing growth mechanisms absent from current models. Time-lapse X-ray micro-computed tomography and spectral imaging reveal preferential nucleation at gas-liquid interfaces, where porous hydrophilic aggregates generate capillary suction that draws brine films toward precipitation sites, accelerating growth and expanding reactive surface area in a positive feedback loop. Spectral tomography shows systematic density gradients reflecting two-stage precipitation: dense macrocrystalline cores formed under moderate supersaturation and evaporation, surrounded by microcrystalline overgrowths from rapid late-stage dynamics. These overgrowths create umbrella-like crusts that encapsulate residual brine beneath surface layers. This porous architecture explains why modest porosity reduction causes severe permeability decline, as aggregates preferentially obstruct flow percolation pathways rather than uniformly cementing grains or filling pore space. Five interconnected mechanisms drive self-enhancing growth across nano- to centimeter scales: interface nucleation, secondary porous structure formation, steep concentration gradients, hydrophilic substrate film maintenance, and capillary-driven solute delivery. Our quantitative characterization of internal salt architecture, reactive surface areas, and pore connectivity provides essential parameters for improving predictive models of evaporation-precipitation dynamics in carbon storage, soil salinization, and cultural heritage preservation.</p>

            <h2>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Madhumita Rano, Henrik R. Larsson</p>
            <p>To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</p>

            <h2>Criticality in 1-dimensional field theories with mesoscopic, infinite range interactions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kurt Langfeld, Amanda Turner</p>
            <p>The study of critical phenomena in one-dimensional field theories with long-range interactions has garnered significant attention following the implications of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, which precludes phase transitions in most low-dimensional theories with local interactions. This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a meso- scopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and a model with continuous O(3) symmetry, and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, spontaneous symmetry breaking and previously unidentified universality classes is evident.</p>

            <h2>Spectral Small-Incremental-Entangling: Breaking Quasi-Polynomial Complexity Barriers in Long-Range Interacting Systems</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Donghoon Kim, Yusuke Kimura, Hugo Mackay, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Hideaki Nishikawa, Carla Rubiliani, Cheng Shang, Ayumi Ukai, Tomotaka Kuwahara</p>
            <p>How the detailed structure of quantum complexity emerges from quantum dynamics remains a fundamental challenge highlighted by advances in quantum simulators and information processing. The celebrated Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem provides a universal constraint on the rate of entanglement generation, yet it leaves open the problem of fully characterizing fine entanglement structures. Here we introduce the concept of Spectral-Entangling strength, which captures the structural entangling power of an operator, and establish a spectral SIE theorem: a universal speed limit for R'enyi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ decay threshold in the entanglement spectrum. Remarkably, our bound at $\alpha=1/2$ is both qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, defining the universal threshold beyond which entanglement growth becomes unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients and enables rigorous truncation-based error control, linking entanglement structure to computational complexity. Building on this, we derive a generalized entanglement area law under an adiabatic-path condition, extending a central principle of quantum many-body physics to general interactions. As a concrete application, we show that one-dimensional long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states, thereby closing the long-standing quasi-polynomial gap and demonstrating that such systems can be simulated efficiently with tensor-network methods. By explicitly controlling R'enyi entanglement, we obtain a rigorous, a priori error guarantee for the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend the SIE theorem to the spectral domain and establish a unified framework that unveils the detailed and universal structure underlying quantum complexity.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cameron Hahn, Nishan Ranabhat, Fabio Anza</p>
            <p>Quantum coherence, is an exquisitely quantum phenomenon that depends on both probability amplitudes and relative phases. Standard coherence measures quantify superposition within density matrices but cannot distinguish ensembles that produce the same mixed state through different distributions of pure states. Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\Phi)$. We show that it characterizes quantum coherence at the ensemble level and that ensemble coherence systematically exceeds density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying the structure lost when averaging over pure states. Eventually, its relevance for quantum thermodynamics and deep thermalization in condensed matter physics is highlighted by explicit examples: canonical ensembles reveal temperature-dependent probability-phase correlations absent from thermal density matrices, while a non-vanishing $I(P;\Phi)$ signals the breakdown of deep thermalization.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> George Mihailescu, Uesli Alushi, Roberto Di Candia, Simone Felicetti, Karol Gietka</p>
            <p>Quantum phenomena offer the possibility of measuring physical quantities with precision beyond classical limits. However, current progress is constrained by scalability, environmental noise, and challenges in practical integration. This highlights the necessity for novel approaches. An emerging paradigm in this direction is critical quantum metrology -- which harnesses the enhanced susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic open-system, dissipative regimes, and strongly correlated fermionic systems, outlining both the challenges and opportunities for future quantum technologies.</p>

            <h2>Adversarial Thermodynamics</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maite Arcos, Philippe Faist, Takahiro Sagawa, Jonathan Oppenheim</p>
            <p>In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty, particularly an agent's tolerance for risk, determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for nonequilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modeled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we consider a Szilard-type engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi divergences in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a Renyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Masahiro Negishi, Hyunsoo Park, Kinga O. Mastej, Aron Walsh</p>
            <p>To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change, increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.</p>

            <p>The electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene induces a robust and reversible conductor-insulator transition, of strong interest in logic-and-memory applications. However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control these materials' electronic properties.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Zekun Zhuang, Daniel Shaffer, Jaglul Hasan, Alex Levchenko</p>
            <p>Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and in-plane magnetic fields have emerged as natural platforms for realizing both the bulk superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) - phenomena characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions due to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Using the quasiclassical Eilenberger formalism, we systematically investigate both the bulk SDE and the JDE in a clean NCS with Rashba SOC and in-plane magnetic fields. For the bulk system, we find that the diode efficiency can nominally approach its maximal value at the critical endpoint of the first-order Lifshitz transition between weak and strong helical phases featuring finite-momentum Cooper pairs, the latter marked by the emergence of Bogolyubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs). In a Josephson junction, we show that finite-momentum pairing in the superconducting leads is the dominant mechanism behind the JDE in short junctions, whereas in long junctions it is primarily governed by the Zeeman field in the normal region. In the long-junction regime, the diode efficiency additionally oscillates between positive and negative values as a function of magnetic field at low fields, providing a route toward a highly tunable Josephson diode. At higher fields, the onset of BFSs in the strong helical phase leads to a sharp suppression of both the JDE and the Josephson current when the current direction is aligned with momenta along the BFS, resulting in strong anisotropy. We propose that this anisotropy in the Josephson current offers an alternative method for detecting BFSs, applicable to systems with or without a JDE.</p>

            <p>Antiperovskite derivatives have emerged as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. However, due to the significant computational cost, their excitonic and polaronic properties remain underexplored despite being critical for optoelectronic performance. Here, we present the structural, electronic, optical, excitonic, and polaronic properties of a series of antiperovskite derivatives with the chemical formula X$_{3}$BI$_{3}$ (X = Ca, Sr; B = P, As, Sb, Bi) using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations. All the compounds exhibit direct bandgaps with G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE bandgap ranging from 2.42 to 3.02 eV, optimal for efficient light absorption with minimal energy loss. Exciton binding energies (0.258-0.318 eV) indicate moderate Coulomb attraction, favoring exciton dissociation. Employing the Feynman polaron model, we established the polaronic properties, where weak to intermediate carrier-phonon coupling was observed, with polaron mobilities reaching values up to 37.19 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. These properties establish X$_{3}$BI$_{3}$ materials as viable candidates for next-generation optoelectronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity from altermagnetic fluctuations</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chen Lu, Chuang Li, Chao Cao, Huiqiu Yuan, Fu-Chun Zhang, Lun-Hui Hu</p>
            <p>Altermagnetic (AM) fluctuations are a new class of collinear spin fluctuations whose role in mediating superconductivity faces a fundamental tension: their $\Gamma$-point peak favors intra-orbital spin-triplet pairing, while their spin compensation favors inter-orbital singlets. Here, we demonstrate that inversion-symmetry-broken AM fluctuations generically resolve this competition in favor of spin-triplet pairing. As a proof of concept, we study a minimal two-orbital model with two van Hove singularities. The broken inversion symmetry induces momentum-orbital locking: the same orbital dominates at opposite momenta, enhancing the triplet channel. Crucially, a subdominant fluctuation channel arising from inter-van-Hove nesting provides an internal Josephson coupling that locks the phase difference between triplet pairs on different orbitals. We find this coupling changes sign ($+$ to $-$) upon a crossover from AM-dominant to ferromagnetic-dominant fluctuations. The resulting $\pi$-phase difference manifests as a $\tau_z$-type order parameter, $c_{k,1\uparrow}c_{-k,1\uparrow} - c_{k,2\uparrow}c_{-k,2\uparrow}$. Although intra-orbital in the original basis, its orbital-nontrivial character, as manifested by its equivalence to inter-orbital pairing under rotation, defines a general \textit{inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity}. This state is distinct from the $\tau_0$-triplet pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, as evidenced by the canceled intra-orbital supercurrent in a Josephson junction between them.</p>

            <p>NbOI$_2$ has recently emerged as a new van der Waals material combining semiconducting behavior with intrinsic in plane ferroelectricity and pronounced transport and optical anisotropy. However, its photocarrier dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here we report transient absorption spectroscopy of NbOI$_2$ using femtosecond pump probe reflectance measurements. A pronounced transient absorption feature is observed near the 2.34 eV excitonic resonance, arising from photocarrier induced excitonic energy shifts and saturation. The decay dynamics reveal an exciton lifetime of several tens of picoseconds and show density-dependent behavior consistent with exciton exciton annihilation, yielding an annihilation coefficient of 0.09 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to that in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Polarization resolved measurements further reveal a pronounced in-plane anisotropy in the transient response that follows the linear absorption anisotropy. These findings provide fundamental insight into photocarrier dynamics in NbOI$_2$ and establish key parameters for understanding and exploiting its optoelectronic behavior.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets have attracted considerable interest for their capacity to generate spin splitting while preserving zero net magnetization. This work proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents than altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is controlled by the Néel vector orientation. In the (110)-oriented $\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$, the Fermi surface exhibits a $d$-wave altermagnetic-like characteristic and becomes compressed into an approximately X-shaped $d$-wave configuration, yielding highly efficient $\cal T$-odd spin currents with a charge-to-spin conversion efficiency reaching 90%. Moreover, when the Néel vector is tilted via unit cell selection or external means, the system generates out-of-plane spin-polarized currents with efficiencies substantially exceeding those of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.</p>

            <p>Loop currents, as an orbital magnetism, have been proposed as a possible fluctuation mechanism for superconducting pairing, which always remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.</p>

            <p>The initialization and control of a long-lived spin population in lead halide perovskites are prerequisites for their use in spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate circular polarization of the interlayer exciton emission in a (BA)2PbI4/WSe2 monolayer heterostructure. The helicity of this emission is controlled by tuning the energy of the excitation laser through the manifold of exciton resonances of the WSe2 monolayer, together with an emerging interlayer absorption feature of the heterostructure. Theoretical calculations show that this resonance arises from hybridized (BA)2PbI4/WSe2 states in the valence band. This hybrid character enables its observation in both linear absorption and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopies, and plays a key role in controlling the sign of the helicity of the interlayer exciton emission. The tunable spin polarization demonstrated here, with the WSe2 monolayer effectively acting as a tunable spin filter, represents an important step toward the use of 2D perovskites in opto-spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB) containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes, and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to $\sim 80\%$. We also considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices.</p>

            <p>The anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical Kerr effect have traditionally been associated with ferromagnets, but recent studies reveal their presence in noncollinear antiferromagnets due to nonzero Berry curvature despite negligible net magnetization. However, Hall measurements often show strong temperature dependence caused by extrinsic scattering, complicating quantitative analysis, and temperature invariance of the Kerr effect remains unconfirmed. Here we employ epitaxial, stoichiometric Mn3NiN single crystal films and perform polar Kerr measurements at an infrared 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength, demonstrating a spontaneous Kerr signal that remains stable within a few percent across a 200 Kelvin range below the Néel temperature. This temperature-invariant Kerr effect contrasts with the strongly temperature-dependent Hall effect and confirms the intrinsic nature of Berry curvature in these materials. Our findings establish infrared Kerr effect as a reliable, local probe of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets, facilitating quantitative characterization and advancing antiferromagnetic spintronic applications.</p>

Here we combine high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis, we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition, our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals.</p>

It exhibits high mechanical compliance, with a Young's modulus approximately 13 times lower and a Poisson's ratio nearly 4 times higher than those of graphene. The optical response is marked by strong ultraviolet absorption, high infrared reflectivity, and pronounced transparency in the visible-light range. Raman and infrared spectra exhibit sharp and well-separated peaks, providing a clear signature of acetylenic linkage stretching vibrations.

            <p>Accurate prediction of atomistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties from molecular structures underpins materials innovation. Existing computational and experimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate chemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled datasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse application domains. Here we develop MIST, a family of molecular foundation models with up to an order of magnitude more parameters and data than prior works. Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse range of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400 structure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and quantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve real-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte solvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction, stereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and multi-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using mechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends not explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn generalizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized Bayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of model development by an order of magnitude. The methods and findings presented here represent a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery, design, and optimization using foundation models and provide valuable guidance for training compute-optimal scientific foundation models.</p>

            <h2>Ab Initio Free Energy Surfaces for Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ethan Abraham, Martin Z. Bazant, Troy Van Voorhis</p>
            <p>The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially anisotropic environments, such as electrochemical interfaces or biomolecular structures, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate, we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Eigensolver with Real-Space Sampling and Symmetric Subspace Measurements</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Lei Xu, Ling Wang</p>
            <p>We propose a hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver to address the computational challenges of simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, where the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement render classical methods intractable. Our approach combines real-space sampling of tensor-network-bridged quantum circuits with symmetric subspace measurements, effectively constraining the wavefunction within a substaintially reduced Hilbert space for efficient and scalable simulations of versatile target states. The system is partitioned into equal-sized subsystems, where quantum circuits capture local entanglement and tensor networks reconnect them to recover global correlations, thereby overcoming partition-induced limitations. Symmetric subspace measurements exploit point-group symmetries through a many-to-one mapping that aggregates equivalent real-space configurations into a single symmetric state, effectively enhancing real-space bipartition entanglement while elimilating redundant degrees of freedom. The tensor network further extends this connectivity across circuits, restoring global entanglement and correlation, while simultaneously enabling generative sampling for efficient optimization. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to the periodic $J_1\!-\!J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, incorporating translation, reflection, and inversion symmetries. With a small matrix product state bond dimension of up to 6, the method achieves an absolute energy error of $10^{-5}$ for a 64-site periodic chain and a $6\times6$ torus after bond-dimension extrapolation. These results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid eigensolver and demonstrate its strong potential for scalable quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems.</p>

            <p>The electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene induces a robust and reversible conductor-insulator transition, of strong interest in logic-and-memory applications. However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control these materials' electronic properties.</p>

            <h2>Twisted superconducting quantum diodes: Towards anharmonicity and high fidelity</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Han Zhong, Denis Kochan, Igor Zutic, Yingying Wu</p>
            <p>As quantum technologies advance, a fundamental challenge is mitigating noise and backscattering in superconducting circuits to achieve scalable, high-fidelity operations. Conventional superconducting components lack directionality, causing energy loss and decoherence. Superconducting diodes, that allow dissipationless current in one direction and resistive flow in the other, offer a potential remedy, yet their efficiency and quantum integration remain limited. Here, we realize a quantum diode in twisted NbSe2 bilayers under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A mere 1 degree twist yields an efficiency enhancement over pristine devices, reaching 27.6 percent. Quantum simulations reveal that this intermediate efficiency, well below 100 percent ideal, is both experimentally practical and optimal for preserving qubit anharmonicity and stabilizing two-level systems. These findings show that maximal rectification is not always beneficial for quantum information, establishing a new principle for designing the fundamental properties of twisted superconductors towards low-power, high-fidelity quantum circuits.</p>

            <p>Topological defects, such as vortices and skyrmions in magnetic and dipolar systems, can give rise to properties that are not observed in typical magnets and dielectrics. Here, we report the discovery of long-range ordered periodic dipole arrays of atomic-scale vortices and antivortices in the unconventional charge-density-wave (CDW) phase of BaTiS3, a quasi-1D chalcogenide. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals the presence of a multi-q ordering in BaTiS3 that confines vortex-vortex-antivortex polarisation triplets to the a-b plane with alternating handedness along the c-axis. The multi-q displacive distortions are characterised by three distinctive off-centre TiS6 configurations, whose ratios are independently confirmed by 47/49Ti solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR). Using first-principles calculations and phenomenological modelling, we show that the dipolar vortex unit cell in BaTiS3 arises from the coupling between multiple lattice instabilities arising from flat, soft phonon bands. This mechanism contrasts with classical dipolar textures in ferroelectric heterostructures that emerge from the competition between electrostatic and strain energies. The observation of dipolar vortices in BaTiS3 brings the ultimate scaling limit for real-space dipolar topological structures down to about a nanometre and unveils the intimate connection between crystal symmetry and real-space topology. Our work sets up zero-filling semiconducting materials with competing structural instabilities as a playground for realising and understanding quantum polarisation topologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shuo Liu, Hao-Kai Zhang, Shuai Yin, Shi-Xin Zhang, Hong Yao</p>
            <p>Non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems has attracted increasing attention owing to a variety of intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. A prominent example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where subsystem symmetry is restored more rapidly under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. In this work, we investigate symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems for a range of initial states. We show that symmetry can still be restored in the many-body localization regime without approaching thermal equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quantum Mpemba effect emerges universally for any tilted product state, in contrast to chaotic systems where its occurrence depends sensitively on the choice of the initial state. We further provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect using an effective model for many-body localization. Overall, this paper fills an important gap in establishing a unified understanding of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in generic many-body systems, and it advances our understanding of many-body localization.</p>

            <p>The discovery of the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in noncollinear antiferromagnets where transverse Hall voltage emerges without magnetic field, has opened a plethora of promising opportunities in antiferromagnetic devices. The key challenges limiting their full potential are (1) high-quality epitaxial thin-film growth and (2) the understanding of Berry curvature domain physics. Here, we focus on a noncollinear antiperovskite antiferromagnet Mn3NiN as a model system, successfully grown as a single-crystal epitaxial thin film. Combining multiple experiments supported by theoretical calculations, we probe the Berry curvature associated with antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4g domains in Mn3NiN and its strong connection to an AHE. We directly image the intrinsic Berry curvature with high-resolution Sagnac microscopy, controlling spatial distribution and dynamics by varying temperature and applied magnetic fields. We discover that the {\Gamma}4g domains are switchable near the Néel transition, but become frozen and unresponsive to external stimuli at low temperature. This behavior enables the tuning of Berry-curvature driven AHE and magneto-optic Kerr effect responses through controlled experimental conditions. Our findings provide critical advancement of the fundamental understanding and wide tunability of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets important for realization in potential spintronic applications.</p>

            <p>Single-crystalline diamond (SCD) films possess exceptional thermal, chemical, and optical properties, making them ideal for advanced applications. However, achieving uniform film quality via microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) remains challenging due to spatial variations in plasma characteristics. This study systematically examines the influence of microwave power and chamber pressure on the growth of SCD films using CH4/H2 gas mixtures. Under optimized conditions (3,900 W, 120 Torr), the films exhibit low surface roughness (~2.0 nm), a sharp sp3 Raman peak at 1,332.2 cm-1, and no detectable C-H related features, indicating high crystalline purity. Cross-sectional TEM analysis confirms a uniform (100)-oriented single-crystal structure across the entire sample. These findings advance the understanding of the interplay between deposition parameters and film quality, and establish a more robust foundation for optimizing MPCVD processes in large-area, high-purity diamond fabrication.</p>

The self-consistent calculation on the three-leg Kadanoff-Baym contour is fully self-contained, employing only QTT-compressed functions and input functions which are either generated directly in QTT form or obtained via quantics tensor cross interpolation.</p>

            <p>Rashba spin-orbit interactions generated by time-dependent electric fields acting on weak links (that couple together non-magnetic macroscopic leads) can magnetize the junction. The Rashba spin-orbit interaction that affects the spins of electrons tunneling through the weak links changes their momentum concomitantly. We establish the connection between the magnetization flux induced by processes that conserve the momentum and the magnetization created by tunneling events that do not. Control of the induced magnetization can be achieved by tuning the polarization of the AC electric field responsible for the spin-orbit Rashba interaction (e.g., from being circular to linear), by changing the applied bias voltage, and by varying the degree of a gate voltage-induced asymmetry of the device.</p>

            <p>We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.</p>

By mapping the spatial distribution of CDW superlattice intensities at nanometer-scale resolution and analyzing their autocorrelations, we extract the temperature-dependent correlation length associated with the local amplitude of the CDW order parameter, independent of global phase coherence. Our results reveal that a finite local CDW amplitude is already established well above the transition temperature. When the system is cooled below the transition temperature down to 20 K, the correlation length extends to nearly 110 nm, and the local CDW amplitude is found to strongly anticorrelate with the local strain field.</p>

            <p>A new type of magnet called $p$-wave unconventional magnet is proposed, stimulated by the discovery of altermagnet. We study the tunneling conductance of $p$-wave unconventional magnet/superconductor junctions by adopting the effective Hamiltonian of $p$-wave unconventional magnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking, suggested in Ref [arXiv: 2309.01607 (2024)]. The tunneling conductance shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to bias voltage in the helical $p$-wave superconductor junctions. It is caused by the missing of helical edge states contributing to the charge conductance owing to the momentum-dependent spin-split feature of the Fermi surface in $p$-wave unconventional magnets. In chiral $d$ and $p$-wave superconductor junctions, the resulting spin-resolved tunneling conductance takes a different value for spin sectors due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. Our results qualitatively reproduce the results based on the simplified Hamiltonian in Ref [J.\ Phys.\ Soc.\ Jpn.\ \textbf{93}, 114703 (2024)], where only the odd function of the exchange coupling of $p$-wave unconventional magnets is taken into account, which gives the shift of the Fermi surface and preserves the time-reversal symmetry similar to the spin-orbit coupling.</p>

The model is parameterized using tight-binding calculations. We compute the interband absorption spectrum, showing a linear-in-frequency dependence at low energies and a resonant feature near the spin-orbit splitting energy. Furthermore, we calculate the circular photogalvanic effect. In agreement with previous works the current generation rate at low frequencies exhibits a quantized low-frequency response, governed by the universal value $|\mathcal{C}| = 4$ for the effective topological charge.

            <p>Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This progress prompts a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we address this question by demonstrating the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model incorporating next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we uncover that NNN interaction parameters can induce fractional topological phases|even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</p>

            <p>Effective interactions between charged particles dispersed in an electrolyte are most commonly modeled using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential, where the ions in the suspension are coarse-grained out at mean-field level. However, several experiments point to shortcomings of this theory, as the distribution of ions surrounding colloids is governed by nontrivial correlations in regimes of strong Coulomb coupling (e.g. low temperature, low dielectric constant, high ion valency, high surface charge). Insight can be gained by explicitly including the ions in simulations of these colloidal suspensions, even though direct simulations of dispersions of highly charged spheres are computationally demanding. To circumvent slow equilibration, we employ a machine-learning (ML) framework to generate density-dependent ML potentials that accurately describe the effective colloid interactions at given system parameters. These ML potentials enable fast simulations and make large-scale simulations of charged colloids in suspension possible, opening the possibility for a systematic study of their phase behaviour, in particular gas-liquid and fluid-solid coexistence.</p>

            <p>Domain walls in ferrimagnets and antiferromagnets behave as relativistic sine-Gordon solitons with the spin-wave group velocity setting the ultimate velocity of domain walls and speed of magnetic devices. While this relativistic regime has been achieved in crystalline ferrimagnets, they cannot be routinely integrated in devices. To enable technological breakthroughs, relativistic dynamics must be demonstrated in easy-to-integrate ferrimagnets such as rare-earth -- transition-metal alloys. However, this scenario remains elusive due to the inherent magnetic disorder of these materials, complex spin-wave spectra, and challenges in modeling their ultrafast dynamics. Here, we demonstrate relativistic domain wall motion in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdFeCo devices operated in the proximity of the angular momentum compensation point. The current-induced domain wall velocity saturates within 10% of the spin-wave speed of 2 km/s, a behavior consistent with relativistic model of domain wall motion.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rong Cheng, Tao Li</p>
            <p>The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice(PAFH) is arguably the most well known strongly frustrated quantum magnet in three spatial dimension. However, due to the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three dimensional system, the nature of its ground state in the thermodynamic limit remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH from the resonating valence bond(RVB) theory perspective. We find a candidate ground state of the system that features a maximally resonating valence bond crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\vec{a}_{1}\times2\vec{a}_{2}\times2\vec{a}_{3}$ periodicity. There are at least four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the translational symmetry. Intriguingly, we find that within the RVB framework such a maximally resonating VBC state is almost degenerate with a recently proposed VBC state that is obtained from dressing hard hexagon covering of the pyrochlore lattice, although they have very different structures. We also find that further symmetry breaking will occur in the dressed hard hexagon VBC state under unrestricted optimization, which results in strong disparity in $\langle \hat{\mathbf{S}}^{2}_{u} \rangle$ for up and down tetrahedrons as we observe in the maximally resonating VBC state. We show that the maximally resonating VBC state found here will be favored by a tiny next-neighboring exchange coupling.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Boltzmann Generators for equilibrium sampling of large-scale materials</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maximilian Schebek, Frank Noé, Jutta Rogal</p>
            <p>The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</p>

            <p>Silicon carbide (SiC) polymorphs are widely employed as nuclear materials, mechanical components, and wide-bandgap semiconductors. The rapid advancement of SiC-based applications has been complemented by computational modeling studies, including both ab initio and classical atomistic approaches. In this work, we develop a computationally efficient and general-purpose machine-learned interatomic potential (ML-IAP) capable of multimillion-atom molecular dynamics simulations over microsecond timescales. Using the ML-IAP, we systematically map the comprehensive pressure-temperature phase diagram and the threshold displacement energy distributions for the 2H and 3C polymorphs. Furthermore, collision cascade simulations provide in-depth insights into polymorph-dependent primary radiation damage clustering, a phenomenon that conventional empirical potentials fail to accurately capture.</p>

            <h2>The Wishart--Rosenzweig--Porter random matrix ensemble</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victor Delapalme, Leticia F. Cugliandolo, Grégory Schehr, Marco Tarzia, Davide Venturelli</p>
            <p>In recent years the Rosenzweig--Porter (RP) ensemble, obtained by adding a diagonal matrix with independent and identically distributed elements to a Gaussian random matrix, has been widely used as a minimal model for the emergence of fractal eigenstates in complex many-body systems. A key open question concerns the robustness of its phase diagram when the assumption of independent and uncorrelated entries is relaxed -- an assumption that simplifies its analysis, but is generally violated in realistic quantum systems. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by considering a deformed Wishart (rather than Gaussian) random matrix, which we dub the ``Wishart--RP'' ensemble. Using perturbation theory, as well as the cavity and replica methods and the Dyson Brownian motion approach, we characterize its phase diagram and localization properties. Remarkably, we show that the level compressibility, which quantifies spectral correlations in the fractal phase, coincides with that of the Gaussian RP model, thereby extending the universality conjectured in [SciPost Phys. 14, 110 (2023)] beyond the fully uncorrelated setting. We confirm our results with numerical tests.</p>

The NEP achieves DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of scenarios commonly encountered in studies of $\alpha$-Fe- and $\alpha$-Fe--C under hydrogen environments. The NEP enables large-scale atomistic simulations with DFT-level accuracy at the cost of empirical potentials, offering a practical tool to study hydrogen embrittlement in steel.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Satoru Hayami, Rikuto Oiwa, Akane Inda</p>
            <p>In condensed matter physics, a broad spectrum of physical characteristics, such as chirality, axiality, and polarity, arises as a direct consequence of the underlying symmetry of the system. We here theoretically investigate the effective coupling between chirality and axiality at their domain boundaries, mediated by polarity. Based on symmetry considerations and model analyses, we propose the concept of chirality-induced axiality via surface polarization, which refers to a phenomenon where the handedness of chirality selects an axial moment with a particular orientation by lowering its energy at the surface. We further establish the inverse process, termed axiality-induced chirality via surface polarization, whereby axiality in turn dictates the preferred chirality. These reciprocal couplings open a new pathway for stabilizing single-domain states of chirality and axiality. They further imply interfacial functionalities, including the selective adsorption of chiral and axial molecules.</p>

            <p>We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. Whereas the usual approach starts from infinite temperature and evolves the state in imaginary time (toward lower temperature), our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be found with a standard tensor network approach. Motivated by properties of the ground state for conformal field theories, our ansatz is especially well suited near criticality. Moreover, it allows an efficient computation of thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate the performance of our approach with a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in one- and two-dimensional scenarios. In particular, in the critical one-dimensional case we show how the ansatz reproduces the finite temperature scaling of entanglement in a conformal field theory.</p>

            <h2>Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Brij Mohan, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla, Manabendra Nath Bera</p>
            <p>Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Additionally, our autonomous refrigerators with negative temperature baths significantly outperform previously studied autonomous and non-autonomous refrigerators in terms of cooling ability without requiring any additional energy resources, as they cool the cold bath to much lower temperature, which is forbidden for others refrigerators. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</p>

            <p>Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) -- which include skeletal stem cells -- are a promising tool in regenerative medicine. However, their heterogeneous and unpredictable in vivo behaviour remains a critical barrier preventing the development of standardized therapeutic approaches for skeletal tissue regeneration. Several studies have attempted to identify in vitro features that could correlate with the in vivo differentiation properties, yet the mechanisms ruling BMSC heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we lineage-trace 32 single-cell-derived BMSC colonies through seven generations. We observe significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneity in lineage topology (determined by the number of senescent or apoptotic cells) and in replicative kinetics (measured from proliferating cells only). Interestingly, topology and kinetics result strongly correlated, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors linking the non-dividing/apoptotic subpopulations with proliferating cells. Furthermore, BMSCs display highly synchronized cell cycles during early generations, indicating stage-specific regulatory mechanisms through which cells influence each other. By employing a non-interacting population growth model, we demonstrate that the observed synchronisation cannot be explained by an uncorrelated branching process; instead, cell-to-cell correlation of division times must exist. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms governing BMSC heterogeneity and growth dynamics that may inform strategies to control their regenerative potential.</p>

            <p>High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.</p>

            <p>The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.</p>

            <p>The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.</p>

            <h2>The Meissner effect in superconductors: emergence versus reductionism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. E. Hirsch</p>
            <p>The Meissner effect, the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of a metal entering the superconducting state, is arguably the most fundamental property of superconductors, discovered in 1933. The conventional theory of superconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the Meissner effect. We will review the arguments that support this consensus, rooted in the concept of emergence. However, recent work has shown that there are questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field expulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory. Within a reductionist approach, it has been proposed that those questions can only be resolved by introducing physics that is not part of the conventional theory, namely that there is radial motion of electric charge in the transition process. This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where motion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We review how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer between electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge motion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications regarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to search for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures. Therefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important.</p>

            <p>Persistent current is a hallmark of quantum phase coherence. We study the fate of the persistent current in a non-equilibrium setting, where a tight-binding ring is subjected to stochastic disorder as well as a fermionic reservoir attached to each site. We evaluate the current using Keldysh technique and find that it exhibits non-monotonic behavior, suggesting two distinct mechanisms of decoherence. While coupling to the reservoirs introduces a coherence length scale given by the inverse of the coupling strength, the other mechanism is more subtle and driven by the ratio of noise strength to reservoir coupling. The interplay of noise and reservoir constitutes a purely non-equilibrium steady state with a flatter distribution function that we effectively describe using classical rate equations. We discuss possibilities of realizing our findings in ultracold-atom experiments.</p>

We find a clear distinction between the two $d$-wave symmetries: $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order produces spin splitting, whereas $d_{xy}$ order preserves spin degeneracy and exhibits splitting of the ABS spectrum induced by intermode hybridization. Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free, parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.</p>

            <p>We investigate the coupling of a multi-mode metal-insulator-metal cavity to a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a quantum well in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The TM cavity mode is strongly hybridized with an intersubband transition of the 2DEG, forming a polaritonic mode in the ultrastrong coupling regime, while the TE mode remains an almost purely cavity mode. The magnetoplasmon excitation emerging from the presence of the magnetic field couples with both TM and TE modes, exhibiting different coupling strengths and levels of spatial field inhomogeneity. While the strong homogeneity of the bare TE mode gives rise to the standard anticrossing of strong coupling, the inhomogeneous polaritonic TM mode is shown to activate an observable Coulombic effect in the spectral response, often referred to as non-locality. This experiment demonstrates a cavity-induced modification of the 2DEG response and offers a new route to probing the effect of Coulomb interactions in ultrastrongly coupled systems via reshaping of their cavity mode profiles.</p>

            <p>We investigate the superconducting (SC) properties of experimentally realised $\gamma$-BiPd by solving the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations in conjunction with {\it ab initio} relativistic calculations of the electron and phonon band structures as well as electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix elements. Our study reveals that $\gamma$-BiPd possesses a complex Fermi surface (FS), consisting of two electron pockets and one hole pocket, each characterised by distinct atomic orbitals. Our key finding is that the superconductivity in $\gamma$-BiPd is primarily orbital-selective, arising from Bi $p$-orbitals, and distributed anisotropically on the FS, although contribution from Pd $d$-orbitals, particularly on the hole pocket, is also discernable. While our results show an anisotropic nature of the {\bf k}-dependent SC gap $\Delta_{\bf k}$ and EPC strength $\lambda_{\bf k}$ across the FS, calculated superconducting quasiparticle density of states $N_S$ spectra exhibit a U-shaped gap and $\Delta_{\bf k}$ distribution forms a single peak, being consistent with the spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity observed in this material. The calculated $T_c$ is $\sim$2.0 K, agreeing in order of magnitude with the experimental value of 3.3 K in $\gamma$-BiPd thin films. The predicted EPC-enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma_n$ of $0.141$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$ is similar to the experimental $\gamma_n$ value ($0.119$ mJ/K$^2$cm$^3$) of the isoelectronic and isostructural Bi(Pd$_{0.5}$Pt$_{0.5}$) alloy.</p>

Both antiparallel domains, an intrinsic outcome of epitaxy on high-symmetry substrates, and associated structural defects have long evaded optical detection. Here, we show that interferometric second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging provides a powerful, nondestructive probe of lattice orientation and structural integrity in chemical vapor deposition-grown hBN. This approach reveals the ubiquitous formation of antiparallel domains and quantifies their impact on crystalline order. SHG intensity also emerges as a direct optical metric of domain disorder, spanning three orders of magnitude across films produced by ten different growth routes. Correlation with Raman spectroscopy establishes a unified framework for evaluating crystalline quality. Beyond hBN, this method offers a high-throughput route to wide-area structural imaging in various non-centrosymmetric materials, advancing their deployment in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies.</p>

            <p>The Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) is a simple yet rich model of strongly interacting electrons with complex dynamics and a variety of emerging quantum phases. These properties make it a compelling target for digital quantum simulation. Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but implementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error mitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping of the FHM to a Z2 LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a subspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection error mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design strategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of NISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In particular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient descent (IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate count of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of simulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on conserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques. Our work demonstrates the value of algorithm-hardware co-design to operate digital quantum simulators at the threshold of maximum circuit depths allowed by current hardware, and is broadly generalizable to strongly correlated systems in quantum chemistry and materials science.</p>

            <p>The controlled integration of quantum dots (QDs) as single-photon emitters into quantum light sources is essential for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. In this study, we employ the deterministic in-situ electron-beam lithography (iEBL) nanotechnology platform to integrate individual QDs with high accuracy and process yield into circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators. Notably, CBG devices comprising just 3 to 4 rings exhibit photon extraction efficiencies comparable to those of structures with more rings. This facilitates faster fabrication, reduces the device footprint, and enables compatibility with electrical contacting. To demonstrate the scalability of this process, we present results of 95 optically active QD-CBG devices fabricated across two lithography sessions. These devices exhibit bright, narrow-linewidth single-photon emission with excellent optical quality. To evaluate QD placement accuracy, we apply a powerful characterization technique that combines cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis of these devices reveals that our iEBL approach enables high alignment accuracy and a process yield of over >90% across various CBG geometries. Our findings highlight a reliable route toward the scalable fabrication of high-performance QD-based single-photon sources for use in photonic quantum technology applications.</p>

Coherent photon driving couples selectively to electronic sublattices, and the resulting altermagnets' symmetry-broken spin texture yields a pronounced steady-state spin imbalance -- coherent magnetization -- absent in conventional antiferromagnets for the same lattice configuration. A mean-field Lindblad analysis reveals the dominance of quadratic over linear couplings. In the strong-coupling regime, distinct polariton signatures emerge in the steady state of induced magnetization.

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Adel Ali, Alexey Belyanin</p>
            <p>We study fermionic and bosonic systems coupled to a real or synthetic static gauge field that is quantized, so the field itself is a quantum degree of freedom and can exist in coherent superposition. A natural example is electrons on a quantum ring encircling a quantized magnetic flux (QMF) generated by a superconducting current. We show that coupling to a common QMF gives rise to an emergent interaction between particles with no classical analog, as it is topological and nonlocal (independent of interparticle distance). Moreover, the interaction persists even when the particles lie in a nominally field-free region, with the vector potential mediating the interaction. We analyze several one- and two-dimensional model systems, encompassing both real and synthetic gauge fields. These systems exhibit unusual behavior, including strong nonlinearities, non-integer Chern numbers, and quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, synthetic gauge fields offer high tunability and can reach field strengths that are difficult to realize with real magnetic fields, enabling engineered nonlinearities and interaction profiles.</p>

            <h2>High harmonic generation light source with polarization selectivity and sub-100-$μ$m beam size for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Haoyuan Zhong, Xuanxi Cai, Changhua Bao, Fei Wang, Tianyun Lin, Yudong Chen, Sainan Peng, Lin Tang, Chen Gu, Zhensheng Tao, Hongyun Zhang, Shuyun Zhou</p>
            <p>High-quality ultrafast light sources are critical for developing advanced time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES). While the application of high harmonic generation (HHG) light sources in TrARPES has increased significantly over the past decade, the optimization of the HHG probe beam size and selective control of the light polarization, which are important for TrARPES measurements, have been rarely explored. In this work, we report the implementation of high-quality HHG probe source with an optimum beam size down to 57 $\mu$m $\times$ 90 $\mu$m and selective light polarization control, together with mid-infrared (MIR) pumping source for TrARPES measurements using a 10 kHz amplifier laser. The selective polarization control of the HHG probe source allows to enhance bands with different orbital contributions or symmetries, as demonstrated by experimental data measured on a few representative transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDCs) as well as topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Furthermore, by combining the HHG probe source with MIR pumping at 2 $\mu$m wavelength, TrARPES on a bilayer graphene shows a time resolution of 140 fs, allowing to distinguish two different relaxation processes in graphene. Such high-quality HHG probe source together with the MIR pumping expands the capability of TrARPES in revealing the ultrafast dynamics and light-induced emerging phenomena in quantum materials.</p>

            <h2>Fractional Quantum Multiferroics from Coupling of Fractional Quantum Ferroelectricity and Altermagnetism</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Q. Dong, B. Liu, Z. H. Dai, Zhi-Xin Guo, Hongjun Xiang, Xin-Gao Gong</p>
            <p>Multiferroics, which combine ferroelectric and magnetic order, offer a transformative platform for next-generation electronic devices. However, the intrinsic competition between the mechanisms driving ferroelectricity and magnetism in single-phase materials severely limits their performance, typically resulting in weak magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature. Here, we propose a solution to this long-standing challenge through the novel concept of fractional quantum multiferroics (FQMF), where strong magnetoelectric coupling is naturally realized by coupling fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE) with altermagnetism (AM). Symmetry analysis shows that reversing the FQFE polarization necessarily inverts the AM spin splitting under parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) or time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}\tau$) operations. A minimal tight-binding model reproduces this effect, demonstrating electrically driven spin control without rotating the Néel vector. First-principles calculations further identify a broad family of candidate materials in two and three dimensions including bulk MnTe, Cr$_2$S$_3$, Mn$_4$Bi$_3$NO$_{15}$ and two-dimensional AB$_2$ bilayers such as MnX$_2$ (X=Cl, Br, I), CoCl$_2$, CoBr$_2$, and FeI$_2$. Notably, MnTe exhibits a high Néel temperature ($\sim$300 K) and a large electrically switchable spin splitting ($\sim$0.8 eV), demonstrating room-temperature magnetoelectric performance that surpasses that of conventional multiferroics. To further showcase the technological potential, we propose an electric-field-controlled FQMF tunnel junction based on MnTe that achieves tunneling magnetoresistance exceeding 300\%. This work establishes FQMF as a distinct and promising route to achieving room-temperature strong magnetoelectric coupling, opening a new avenue for voltage-controlled spintronics.</p>

            <h2>Automatic Refinement of Force Fields Based on Phase Diagrams</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bin Jin, Bin Han, Wei Feng, Kuang Yu, Shenzhen Xu</p>
            <p>Exact characterization of phase transitions requires sufficient configurational sampling, necessitating efficient and accurate potential energy surfaces. Molecular force fields with computational efficiency and physical interpretability are desirable but challenging to refine for complex interactions. To address this, we propose a force field refinement strategy with phase diagrams as top-down optimization targets based on automatic differentiation. Using gas-liquid co-existence as a paradigm, we employ an enhanced sampling technique and design a differentiable loss function to evaluate force fields' depiction of phase diagrams. The refined force fields produce gas-liquid phase diagrams matching well with targets for two modeling systems, which confirms our approach as an effective automated force field development framework for phase transition studies.</p>

            <p>We propose the realization of a spin-2 Floquet spinor Bose-Einstein condensate via Floquet engineering of the quadratic Zeeman energy. In the Floquet system, the coupling strengths of all angular-momentum-conserving spin-flip processes are renormalized by driving-parameter-dependent Bessel functions. Such Floquet-engineered interactions significantly enriches possible ground states in homogeneous gases. The resulting phase diagrams, which map the distributions of these possible ground states, are presented in the space of the driving parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shah Hussain, Sikander Azam, Umme Habiba, Qaiser Rafiq, Amin Ur Rahman, Hamada H. Amer, Yasir Saeed</p>
            <p>Rare earth doping is an effective way to convert chemically stable oxides into multifunctional materials with coupled electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. We present first principles calculations of pristine and Tm3+ doped Ca2SnO4 to understand how localized 4f states change the structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical behavior of the host. Pristine Ca2SnO4 is a mechanically stable, wide band gap insulator with mostly ionic covalent bonding and diamagnetic character. Replacing Ca2+ with Tm3+ introduces several key changes: (i) localized Tm 4f states create intermediate levels inside the wide gap, reducing the optical band gap; (ii) exchange and spin orbit interactions generate strong local magnetic moments and spin asymmetry near the conduction band; (iii) electron localization function analysis shows enhanced covalency and electron pockets that stabilize luminescent centers; and (iv) the optical response shows visible range absorption, refractive index features, and low energy plasmon peaks while maintaining high energy dielectric stability. These effects make Tm doped Ca2SnO4 a mechanically robust, optically tunable, and magnetically active oxide phosphor suitable for red emission, intermediate band photovoltaics, and spin photon coupling. More broadly, our results show how targeted rare earth substitution can enable multifunctionality in wide gap stannates and guide the design of next generation spintronic photonic oxides.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> V. E. Timofeev, D. N. Aristov</p>
            <p>A regular lattice of magnetic skyrmions is the ground state of thin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in a relatively wide range of external magnetic fields. It was previously theoretically shown that upon the increase of magnetic field a topological transition in the magnon spectrum of such skyrmion crystal (SkX) may occur. Non-uniform magnetic field may lead to localized magnon states emerging at the interface between two half-planes of SkX. Using semiclassical quantization and the stereographic projection approach, we study such appearing edge states both in a full band structure calculation and in simplified effective model. The latter effective model described by extended Dirac equation is applicable to two relevant magnon bands near $\Gamma$ point. We show that both the chirality of emerging edge states and the degree of its localization at the interface is controlled by magnetic field profile. We demonstrate that the localization length may be as small as a few inter-skyrmion distances.</p>

            <h2>A first-principles investigation of the diffusivities of oxygen and oxygen defects in ThO$_2$</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Maniesha Singh, Anter El-Azab</p>
            <p>A comprehensive analysis is presented for the diffusivity of oxygen defects and oxygen self-diffusion in ThO$-2$. The migration energy and diffusivity of oxygen defects with nominal charges have been investigated using density functional theory and phonon simulations. The pathway for the lowest migration energy barrier of oxygen vacancies was found to be along the $\langle 100 \rangle$ direction. Neutral and non-neutral oxygen interstitials exhibited direct (interstitial) and indirect (interstitialcy) migration, respectively. The vacancy migration barrier was found to be lowest for the highest charge, while for interstitials, it is lowest when the charge is lowest. The attempt frequencies of defects were calculated using the Eyring and Vineyard theories. These frequencies displayed a similar dependence on the defect charge as the activation barriers. The charge-averaged diffusivity of vacancies and interstitials were also computed. Across all temperatures, the average vacancy diffusivity was found to be greater than that of interstitial, indicating that oxygen vacancies are more mobile than interstitials. Oxygen self- and chemical diffusion coefficients were analyzed by combining the defect diffusivities with the concentrations computed using an equilibrium defect thermodynamics. The self-diffusion coefficient of oxygen was found to rise with temperatures and lower oxygen pressures. The contributions of various defects to self-diffusion of oxygen were subsequently examined. In the normal to high oxygen pressure range, at all temperatures, it is found that interstitials contribute most to oxygen diffusion in ThO2. At low oxygen pressures, vacancies with highest charge state were found to dominate oxygen diffusion. The chemical diffusion coefficient of oxygen was further computed, which was found to increase with temperature and decrease with hypo-stoichiometry in ThO2 to a plateau value.</p>

            <p>The crystal lattice governs the emergent electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of quantum materials, making structural tuning through strain, pressure, or chemical substitution a key approach for discovering and controlling novel quantum phases. Beyond static modifications, driving specific lattice modes with ultrafast stimuli offers a dynamic route for tailoring material properties out of equilibrium. However, achieving dynamic coherent control of the nonequilibrium phases via resonant excitation of lattice coherences remains largely unexplored. Such manipulation enables non-volatile, on demand amplification and suppression of order parameters on femtosecond timescales, necessary for next generation optoelectronic ultrafast computation. In this study, we demonstrate coherent phononic control of a newly discovered, light-induced metastable magnetization in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By using a sequence of terahertz (THz) pulses, we modulate the magnetization amplitude at the frequencies of phonon coherences, whose infrared-active nature and symmetries are further revealed by polarization- and field-strength-dependent measurements. Furthermore, our two-dimensional THz spectroscopy, in tandem with first-principles numerical simulations, shows that these phonons nonlinearly displace a Raman active phonon, which induces the metastable net magnetization. These findings not only clarify the microscopic mechanism underlying the metastable state in FePS3 but also establish vibrational coherences in solids as a powerful tool for ultrafast quantum phase control, enabling manipulation of material functionalities far from equilibrium.</p>

            <p>The Landau-Brazovskii model provides a theoretical framework for describing various phases arising from competing short- and long-range interactions in many physical systems. In this work, we investigate phase transitions among various ordered phases within the three-dimensional Landau-Brazovskii model. We construct the phase diagram of this model, which encompasses eight distinct phases, and systematically compute the transition pathways connecting various metastable and stable states using the Landau-Brazovskii saddle dynamics. Along each transition pathway, the critical nucleus is identified with some detailed analyses of its shape, energy barrier, and Hessian eigenvalues. Furthermore, we explore how the transition state is influenced by model parameters, revealing systematic trends in critical nucleus sizes and energy barrier heights. Our results provide a comprehensive characterization of the nucleation mechanisms within the Landau-Brazovskii model and offer valuable insights into the structural transformations of modulated-phase systems.</p>

            <p>We present a minimal model for autonomous robotic swarms in one- and higher-dimensional spaces, where identical, field-driven agents interact pairwise to self-organize spacing and independently follow local gradients sensed through quantized digital sensors. We show that the collective response of a multi-agent train amplifies sensitivity to weak gradients beyond what is achievable by a single agent. We discover a fractional transport phenomenon in which, under a uniform gradient, collective motion freezes abruptly whenever the ratio of intra-agent sensor separation to inter-agent spacing satisfies a number-theoretic commensurability condition. This commensurability locking persists even as the number of agents tends to infinity. We find that this condition is exactly solvable on the rationals -- a dense subset of real numbers -- providing analytic, testable predictions for when transport stalls. Our findings establish a surprising bridge between number theory and emergent transport in swarm robotics, informing design principles with implications for collective migration, analog computation, and even the exploration of number-theoretic structure via physical experimentation.</p>

            <p>In this study, we employ a multi-scale computational modeling approach, combining density functional theory (DFT) and self-consistent charge density functional tight binding (SCC-DFTB), to investigate hydrogen (H2) production and dissociation mechanisms from ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) on pristine and nickel-doped graphene. These two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for applications in advanced gas sensing and catalysis. Our analysis reveals that Ni-doped graphene, validated through work function calculations, is a promising material for gas separation and hydrogen production. The samples with adsorbed molecules are characterized by calculating chemical potential, chemical hardness, electronegativity, electrophilicity, vibrational frequencies, adsorbtion and Gibbs energies by DFT calculations. Methane molecules preferentially adsorb at the hexagonal ring centers of graphene, while ammonia inter-acts more strongly with carbon atoms, highlighting distinct molecular doping mechanisms for CH4 and NH3. Dynamic simulations show that CH4 splits into CH3+H, with Ni-doped graphene facilitating enhanced hydrogen transmission, while NH3 dissociates into NH2+H, which may lead to N2H4 formation. Our non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) simulations demonstrate increased H-atom transmission on Ni-doped graphene during gas interactions. These findings suggest that Ni-doped graphene is superior to pristine graphene for applications in gas separation, hydrogen production, and high-sensitivity sensors.</p>

            <h2>Optimal transport by a Lagrangian dynamics of population distribution</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Babak Benam, Abolfazl Ramezanpour</p>
            <p>Human mobility, enabled by diverse transportation modes, is fundamental to urban functionality. Studying these movements across scales-from microscopic to macroscopic-yields valuable insights into urban dynamics. Local adaptation and (self-)organization in such systems are expected to result in dynamical behaviors that are represented by stationary trajectories of an appropriate effective action. In this study we develop a Lagrangian dynamical model for movement processes, using local population functions as the coordinate variables. An efficient gradient descent algorithm is introduced to estimate the optimal Lagrangian parameters minimizing a local error function of the dynamical process. We show that even a quadratic Lagrangian, incorporating dissipation, effectively captures the dynamics of synthetic and empirical movement data. The inferred models reveal that inertia and dissipation are of comparable importance, while interactions and randomness in the movements induce significant qualitative changes in model parameters. Our results provide an interpretable and generative model for human mobility, with potential applications in movement prediction.</p>

            <p>This work reports optical and electronic numerical modelling of a novel emerging structure which is the GaAs nanocrystal on Si tandem solar cell by epitaxial lateral overgrowth, a technique which allows defect free material growth. The techniqueconsists of creating nucleation sites in a silicon surface SiO2 layer and initiating growth of nanoscalescale seeds, whereby strain energy remains below the Matthews-Blakeslee strain relaxation limit. This leads to AlxGaAs growth in micro-crystals without generation of material defects. The focus of this presentation is optical and electrical modelling of nanocrystals for applications in the very active field of silicon based multijunction solar cells, and design of a AlxGaAs/Si two terminal tandem, for compositions ranging from x=0 to x=30% in absorber layers. We present a model of the complete structure in two dimensions, consisting of a Al xGaAs high bandgap subcell connected with a tunnel junction to the low bandgap Si junction. The elaboration of models is described, with an emphasis on the AlxGaAs crystal featuring a non-planar pn-junction, and a focus on the optical properties of this lattice of micrometric AlGaAs crystals and in particular their light trapping properties from the resulting surface texture. The question of AlxGaAs surface coverage is addressed, given that neighbouring AlxGaAs crystals have different crystal orientations on a (111) Si surface, such that any coalescence of neighbour AlxGaAs crystals leads to crippling defects at their interface. The result is that some high energy incident light above the AlxGaAs bandgap is nevertheless transmitted directly to the Si cell, such that the resulting photogenerated carriers thermalise to the Silicon bandgap, and result in a loss of efficiency. The interface between AlxGaAs and Si subcells is addressed, with an emphasis on current transport efficiency through the nanoseeds and tunnelling currents through appropriately designed SiO2 buffer layers. This work therefore presents a theoretical framework for evaluating the potential of AlxGaAs nanocrystal growth on Si for light trapping, for GaAs silicon two terminal tandem cell performance including tunnel junctions, and provides models and design rules for efficient AlxGaAs microcrystal arrays as high bandgap subcells for tandem solar cells on silicon.</p>

The latter method is compared with differential scanning calorimetry measurements. The methodology is applied in an Al-richer range of composition of standard CuZnAl SMA where a minimum of transformation hysteresis is observed.</p>

            <h2>Financial Interactions and Collective States Banks, Investors and Firms</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pierre Gosselin (IF), Aïleen Lotz</p>
            <p>In a previous paper, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a microeconomic framework of investors and firms. The financial connections were modeled by a field of stakes, representing the links between agents. We showed that the resulting collective states were composed of interconnected groups of agents defined by their connections, their returns and disposable capital. However, within this framework, the collective states exhibited structural instability, as capital shortages in specific sectors could trigger cascades of defaults. The present model refines this framework by introducing a third type of agent, banks, a type of investor that can create money through loans. We show that money creation neither eliminates systemic instability nor prevents the emergence of defaults. In fact, the effect of banks on system stability and defaults is ambiguous: When banks favor firms over investors, money creation stabilizes the system by providing the necessary capital to prevent initial defaults, whereas when banks favor investors over firms, investors' influence is strengthened, potentially amplifying instability and defaults. Moreover, regardless of whether they favor investors or firms, banks may facilitate the propagation of defaults once they have started. Ultimately, because banks are themselves investors, the emergence of highly capitalized, high-return banks can directly generate instability in the system. Beyond these mechanisms, the analysis reveals the structural limits of macroprudential regulation. Highly capitalized, high-return investors and banks may appear more diversified and resilient, yet they constitute the primary source of endogenous instability. The model thus highlights that systemic fragility is inherent to the very structure of financial interdependence and capital flows.</p>

            <p>Intermetallics often exhibit complex crystal structures, which give rise to intricate defect structures that critically influence their mechanical and functional properties. Despite studies on individual defect types, a comprehensive understanding of the defect landscape in {\mu}-phases, a class of topologically close-packed phases, remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the planar defect structures in the Ta-Fe {\mu}-phase across a compositional range of 46 to 58 at.% Ta using electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Electron backscatter diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a transition from basal twin boundaries and planar faults containing C14 TaFe2 Laves phase layers at a low Ta content to pyramidal {1\bar{1}02} twins at a higher Ta content. Density functional theory calculations of defect formation energies confirm a chemical potential-driven stabilisation of Laves phase lamellae. The prevalence of pyramidal twins in Ta-rich {\mu}-phase samples is attributed to the competitive nature of different planar defects during solidification. A defect landscape for {\mu}-phases is proposed, illustrating the interplay between site occupancy, dislocation types and planar faults across the chemical potential space. These findings provide fundamental insights into defect engineering in structurally complex intermetallics and open pathways for optimising material properties through chemical tuning.</p>

            <p>Area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) is an emerging technology in semiconductor manufacturing. However, accurately understanding inhibitor reactivity on surfaces remains challenging, particularly when the substrate is amorphous. In this study, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate reaction pathways and quantify the reactivity of (N,N-dimethylamino)trimethylsilane (DMATMS) and ethyltrichlorosilane (ETS) at silanol (-OH), siloxane (-O-), amine (-NH2), and imide (-NH-) sites on both amorphous and crystalline silicon oxide and silicon nitride surfaces. Notably, both molecules exhibit greater reactivity toward terminal sites (-OH and -NH2) on amorphous surfaces compared to crystalline counterparts. For bridge sites, -O- and -NH-, multiple reaction pathways are identified, with bridge-cleavage reactions being the predominant mechanism, except for DMATMS reactions with nitride surfaces. The reactivity of DMATMS with -NH- sites is comparable to that with -NH2, with both reactions yielding volatile products. This study underscores the importance of amorphous surface modeling in reliably predicting inhibitor adsorption and reactivity on realistic surfaces. Moreover, we outline a computational screening approach that accounts for site-specific precursor-inhibitor interactions, enabling efficient and rational theoretical design of AS-ALD precursor-inhibitor pairs.</p>

            <p>We investigate a hybrid device, consisting of two quantum dots proximized by a BCS superconductor and coupled to two external normal electrodes. Assuming charge tunneling between quantum dots through the spin-flip processes, we study the molecular Andreev bound states appearing in the proximized quantum dots. We show that the spin-orbit coupling induces four quasiparticle states. For the appropriate set of model parameters, two of these internal quasiparticles merge, forming the zero-energy state. Under such circumstances, we obtain fully spin-polarized versions of the Majorana quasiparticles, localized on different quantum dots. This situation occurs solely when the spin-orbit interaction is equally strong to the magnitude of crossed Andreev reflections, i.e. in the sweet spot. Otherwise, these processes are competitive, as indicated in expectation values of the corresponding order parameters. We analyze signatures of such competition manifested under the nonequilibrium conditions, for various configurations of bias voltage. In particular, for the symmetric bias voltage between the normal electrodes and the Cooper pair splitter bias configuration we reveal duality in the transport properties. Charge transport through the zero-energy state at the sweet spot is contributed by perfectly entangled electrons with an (almost) ideal transmission. Transport studies would thus enable empirical detection of the molecular quasiparticle states and the efficiency of dissipation processes caused by the external normal electrodes.</p>

            <h2>Geometry-Driven Charge and Spin Transport in $\beta12$ Borophene Quantum Dots</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seyed Mahdi Mastoor, Amirhossein Ahmadkhan Kordbacheh</p>
            <p>Theoretical research has been conducted to study how geometry affects charge and spin transport in $\beta\mathrm{12}$ borophene quantum dots, which are confined systems. The study examined two distinct central regions, which included a circular disc and a regular hexagonal area that connected to semi-infinite zigzag and armchair borophene nanoribbon leads. The system was described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration: armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts. Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and $\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based nanoscale spintronic devices.</p>

            <h2>Attaining the Ground State of Kagome Artificial Spin Ice via Ultrafast Site-Specific Laser Annealing</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> D. Pecchio, S. Sahoo, V. Scagnoli, L. J. Heyderman</p>
            <p>Artificial spin ices (ASIs) provide a versatile platform to explore magnetic frustration and emergent phenomena. However, in kagome ASI, experimental access to the ground state remains elusive due to dynamical freezing. Here, we demonstrate a deterministic and rewritable approach to attain the ground state using ultrafast, site-selective laser annealing. By engineering sublattice-dependent optical absorption through selective capping of the nanomagnets with Cr or utilizing different nanomagnet thicknesses, we achieve selective partial demagnetization of one sublattice under a sub-coercive magnetic field, driving the system into the ground state in a single switching step. Magnetic force microscopy reveals nearly perfect long-range ordering, while heat-transfer simulations confirm the sublattice-selective excitation mechanism. This work establishes an ultrafast method to attain the kagome ASI ground state, which does not require a modification of the geometry of the ASI or the materials used for the individual nanomagnets. Beyond ground-state writing, this site-selective activation provides an important tool for controlling the magnetic states, which is important for applications such as reconfigurable magnonic crystals, neuromorphic computing and programmable nanomagnetic logic.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Taras Holovatch, Yuri Kozitsky, Krzysztof Pilorz, Yurij Holovatch</p>
            <p>The following model is studied analytically and numerically: point particles with masses $m,\mu,m, \dots$ ($m\geq\mu$) are distributed over the positive half-axis. Their dynamics is initiated by giving a positive velocity to the particle located at the origin; in its course the particles undergo elastic collisions. We show that, for certain values of $m/\mu$, starting from the initial state where the particles are equidistant the system evolves in a hydrodynamic way: (i) the rightmost particle (blast front) moves as $t^{\delta}$ with $\delta < 1$; (ii) recoiled particles behind the front enter the negative half-axis; (iii) the splatter -- the particles with locations $x\leq 0$ -- moves in the ballistic way and eventually takes over the whole energy of the system. These results agree with those obtained in S. Chakraborti et al, SciPost Phys. 2022, 13, 074, for $m/\mu=2$ and random initial particle positions. At the same time, we explicitly found the collection of positive numbers $\{\mathcal{M}_i, i \in \mathbf{N} \}$ such that, for $m/\mu = \mathcal{M}_i$, $i\leq 700$, the following holds: (a) the splatter is absent; (b) the number of simultaneously moving particles is at most three; (c) the blast front moves in the ballistic way. However, if, similarly as in S. Chakraborti et al, the particle positions are sampled from a uniformly distributed ensemble, for $m/\mu = \mathcal{M}_i$ the system evolves in a hydrodynamic way.</p>

            <p>We present the results of measurements of bulk current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and local surface I-V characteristics by atomic force microscopy (AFM) of iodine-doped PbS films. It is established that bulk I-V curves of both undoped and iodine-doped PbS films demonstrate a linear (ohmic) U(I) dependence. The tipe of local surface I-V characteristics is ohmic at the concentration range of the dopant 0<[NH4I]<=0.10 M and becomes rectifying at [NH4I]>=0.15 M, which is determined by a decrease in the size and a change in the shape of the film grains, as well as a decrease in the surface roughness of the film. An increase in the iodine content in the PbS(I) films leads to nonlinear dependences of the microscopic characteristics and photoelectric parameters of the PbS(I) films. A sharp decrease in the diffusion coefficient, the beginning of an increase in the charge carrier lifetime, a maximum in voltage sensitivity and specific detectability are observed in the PbS(I) film chemically deposited from a reaction mixture containing [NH4I] = 0.15 M. This indicates that the optimalconcentration of iodine in the film is 2.7 at.%.</p>

            <h2>Memory as activity: pattern formation in a conserved scalar field</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vaishnavi Gajendragad, Suropriya Saha</p>
            <p>We explore the concept of memory in scalar active matter systems, focusing on the collective dynamics of particles whose interactions depend on their evolutionary history rather than on their present configuration. We do so by introducing the idea of an active particle whose velocity acquires an active contribution that depends on its past trajectory suitably weighted by a memory kernel. The memory kernel is unrelated to the thermal noise acting on the particle, meaning that the particle breaks detailed balance at the microscopic level. The number density of these active particles is described by a Cahn-Hilliard equation, which typically describes passive phase separation, suitably modified to account for this particular non-equilibrium effect. Through theory and simulations we establish the novel emergent features of the model and use the example of time delayed interactions to highlight the novel pattern-forming abilities of the model.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kai Chen, Pavan Hosur</p>
            <p>The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a nonreciprocal supercurrent, has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications. However, most studies have focused on weakly correlated models, leaving the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the SDE largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by investigating the SDE in asymmetric band metals with Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interaction, which are exactly solvable due to their locality in Bloch momentum space. Through a combination of low-energy analysis and a numerical self-consistent approach, we demonstrate that HK interaction can enhance the SDE's quality factor. Our findings shed light on the role of strong electron-electron correlations in shaping the SDE.</p>

            <p>Nanoporous membranes, leveraging their high-throughput characteristics, have been widely applied in fields such as molecular separation and energy conversion. Due to interpore interactions, besides the applied voltage and solution environment, the ion transport properties in porous membranes are influenced by the pore number and spacing. Here, to understand and control the transport properties of nanopore arrays, we systematically investigate the ion transport characteristics through membranes with different charge properties, pore numbers, and interpore distances. Using numerical simulations, we analyzed local ionic concentrations and electric potential in nanopore arrays containing nanopores with uniformly charged walls as well as unipolar diodes i.e., pores containing a junction between a charged zone and a neutral zone, and showed significant ion concentration polarization (ICP) for all studied cases. As the number of pores increased and the interpore spacing decreased, the enhanced interpore interactions through ICP led to a greater deviation of the total ionic current from the linear superposition of single-pore currents. Conversely, in bipolar nanopores whose walls contain a junction between positively and negatively charged zones ICP becomes negligible, and interpore interactions are substantially reduced. Furthermore, for membranes with various charge properties, the total current through nanopore arrays presents different quantitative dependence on the pore number under varying pore spacings. Our findings clarify the mechanism of interpore interactions in modulating ion transport through porous membranes, providing critical insights for designing nanofluidic devices based on nanopore arrays, such as nanopore-array sensors.</p>

            <p>Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, which combine bi-dimensional materials of different properties, enable a range of quantum phenomena. Here, we present a comparative study between the electronic properties of mono- and bi-layer of platinum diselenide (PtSe2) grown on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphene substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT), the electronic structure of PtSe2/graphene and PtSe2/h-BN vdW heterostructures are investigated in systematic manner. In contrast to PtSe2/h-BN, the electronic structure of PtSe2/graphene reveals the presence of interlayer hybridization between PtSe2 and the graphene, which is evidenced by minigap openings in the {\pi}-band of graphene. Furthermore, our measurements show that the valence band maximum (VBM) of monolayer PtSe2 is located at the {\Gamma} point with different binding energies of about -0.9 eV and -0.55 eV relative to the Fermi level on h-BN and graphene and substrates, respectively. Our results represent a significant advance in the understanding of electronic hybridization between TMDs and different substrates, and they reaffirm the crucial role of the substrate in any nanoelectronic applications based on van der Waals heterostructures.</p>

            <p>Altermagnets combine zero net magnetization with giant spin splitting, enabling spin-polarized transport without strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Deterministically selecting the conducting spin channel, however, requires breaking the 90 degree rotation and time-reversal antisymmetry (C4zT). Using standard axial vector transformation rules as preliminaries, we show that in monolayer Ta2TeSeO this can be achieved naturally and tuned in a symmetry efficient way by rotating the Neel vector. Without considering the Neel vector, Ta2TeSeO has one pair of mirror protected spin polarized Weyl points in each spin channel. Aligning the Neel vector along the crystallographic x or y direction breaks the mirror symmetry Mx or My, inducing selective mirror symmetry breaking that keeps one spin sector gapless and opens a gap in the opposite spin, yielding fully spin polarized transport. The C2z symmetry breaking makes the preserved two Weyl points inequivalent, turning the half semimetal into a half metallic state. The same orientation selective symmetry reduction applies to lattice vibrations, implying phonon chirality splitting. Owing to the near degenerate in plane anisotropy, reversible zero moment switching is achievable with minute in plane strain or weak magnetic fields, and the lattice coupling suggests control by circularly polarized light. The mechanism extends to other two dimensional decorated Lieb altermagnets lacking horizontal mirror Mz, providing a general low power route to spin filtering and logic.</p>

            <p>Flexible slender structures such as rods, ribbons, plates, and shells exhibit extreme nonlinear responses bending, twisting, buckling, wrinkling, and self contact, that defy conventional simulation frameworks. Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) has emerged as a geometry first, structure preserving paradigm for modeling such behaviors. Unlike finite element or mass spring methods, DDG discretizes geometry rather than governing equations, allowing curvature, twist, and strain to be defined directly on meshes. This approach yields robust large deformation dynamics, accurate handling of contact, and differentiability essential for inverse design and learning based control. This review consolidates the rapidly expanding landscape of DDG models across 1D and 2D systems, including discrete elastic rods, ribbons, plates, and shells, as well as multiphysics extensions to contact, magnetic actuation, and fluid structure interaction. We synthesize applications spanning mechanics of nonlinear instabilities, biological morphogenesis, functional structures and devices, and robotics from manipulation to soft machines. Compared with established approaches, DDG offers a unique balance of geometric fidelity, computational efficiency, and algorithmic differentiability, bridging continuum rigor with real time, contact rich performance. We conclude by outlining opportunities for multiphysics coupling, hybrid physics data pipelines, and scalable GPU accelerated solvers, and by emphasizing DDG role in enabling digital twins, sim to real transfer, and intelligent design of next generation flexible systems.</p>

            <p>Chirality in solids is attracting growing attention as a potential ferroic order, yet virtually no paradigmatic example of a soft-mode achiral-to-chiral phase transition has been firmly established to date. Here we identify ferroelectric bubble domains as a model system that undergoes a strain-driven achiral-to-chiral transition exhibiting the hallmarks of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Using second-principles atomistic simulations, we uncover chiral phonon modes in ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices that soften under epitaxial strain following textbook soft-mode behaviour. The transition is accompanied by a change in topological character, highlighting an interplay between chirality and topology in these systems. This work provides a concrete step towards establishing chirality as a genuine ferroic order in solids.</p>

The geometry of such trajectories, as well as the corresponding conductivity regimes, have been well studied theoretically; however, they have not yet been observed experimentally.

In this work, we take advantage of the layer-by-layer growth regime to fabricate epitaxial CrVO$_3$ superlattice thin films with atomic-scale accuracy on the periodic arrangement of Cr and V layers. By means of X-ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, we confirm the thickness control in the sub-unit cell scale, alternating 3, 2 or 1 single atomic layers of Cr$_2$O$_3$ and V$_2$O$_3$. For the first time, we stabilize the ilmenite phase of CrVO$_3$ (space group R-3) and compare the functional properties of the thin film with those calculated by density functional theory. This novel approach to the growth of ordered corundum oxides opens the path towards the stabilization of new complex oxides with tailored properties by varying the composition and the superlattice period, ultimately broadening the family of functional rhombohedral oxides.</p>

            <p>We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling mechanisms in 19 altermagnetic and 4 ferrimagnetic Type-I multiferroics using electronic band structure calculations with spin-orbit coupling, a first-principles ME response framework, and spin-space-group theory analysis. We formulate a universal scheme for realizing nonvolatile ME coupling in Type-I multiferroics, where two distinct pathways emerge, each dictated by spin-space symmetry. The first pathway is associated with switching of the spin splitting or the now familiar spin-momentum locking in reciprocal space, characteristic of some altermagnetic mul-tiferroics that exhibit coexisting antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. The second pathway involves real-space magnetization switching via electric polarization reversal, characterized by switchable components of the linear ME tensor, despite the traditionally weak coupling in Type-I systems due to the independent origins of magnetism and ferroelectricity. We demonstrate that these two intrinsic ME coupling mechanisms are mutually exclusive and propose thermodynami-cally stable compounds for experimentation. Our findings establish general design principles for controlling robust nonvolatile ME effects in multiferroic materials.</p>

            <p>The formation and subsequent growth of structural defects in an irradiated material can strongly influence the material's performance in technological and industrial applications. Predicting how the growth of defects affects material performance is therefore a pressing problem in materials science. One common computational approach that is used to examine defect growth is cluster dynamics, a method which employs a system of mean-field rate equations to track the time evolution of concentrations of individual defect types. However, the computational complexity of performing cluster dynamics can limit its practical implementation, specifically in the context of exploring a broad set of physical conditions corresponding to, for example, different temperatures and pressures. Here, we present a machine learning approach to circumvent the computational challenges of performing cluster dynamics while maintaining high accuracy in the prediction of defect concentrations. The method is illustrated on the nuclear material uranium nitride but is broadly applicable to other materials. The developed data-driven method is shown to accurately capture complex correlations between material properties, temperature, irradiation conditions, and the concentration of defects.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari</p>
            <p>A fundamental issue in the renormalization-group (RG) theory of critical phenomena concerns the allowed values of critical exponents that are consistent with the continuous nature of a phase transition. Here we conjecture a lower bound for the length-scale exponent $\nu$ that should hold at continuous transitions associated with $d$-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) $\Phi^4$ theories with a multicomponent scalar field $\varphi_i$ (including some extensions with fermionic and gauge fields). If $\Delta_\varphi=(d-2+\eta)/2$ is the dimension of the order parameter -- $\varphi_i$ in LGW models -- and $\Delta_\varepsilon=d-1/\nu$ is the RG dimension of the energy operator $\varepsilon$, which can be identified with $[\sum_i \varphi_i^2]$ (the squared field with a proper subtraction of the mixing with the identity), we conjecture the inequality $\Delta_\varepsilon - 2 \Delta_\varphi\ge 0$, which implies $1/\nu \le 2-\eta$ and $\gamma = (2-\eta)\nu\ge 1$. These inequalities are supported by general arguments for lattice models, exact relations for two-dimensional minimal conformal field theories, and are consistent with all known (numerical, perturbative, and exact) results for LGW $\Phi^4$ theories. In particular, since unitarity requires $\eta\ge 0$, the above inequality implies $\nu\ge 1/2$ for unitary theories. This lower bound is more restrictive than the bound $\nu > 1/d$, which is derived by noting that $\nu=1/d$ is the expected behavior at first-order transitions.</p>

The capsules, modeled as flexible membranes enclosing active internal regions, exhibit a rich variety of behaviors shaped by their geometry and the interplay between internal and external activity. Circular capsules with active interiors undergo persistent rotation driven by internally confined +1/2 topological defects. Axisymmetric capsules, such as boomerangs, develop directed motion along their axis of symmetry due to unbalanced active forces generated by defect distributions near their boundaries. We further show that capsule flexibility suppresses motility and rotation, as active stresses are dissipated into shape deformations. These findings reveal how shape, deformability, and defect dynamics cooperate to produce emergent motility in soft active matter, with potential applications in the design of microswimmers and drug delivery vehicles.</p>

            <p>We briefly review the early development of the mean-field dynamics for cooperatively interacting quantum many-body systems, mapped to pseudo-spin (Ising-like) systems. We start with (Anderson, 1958) pseudo-spin mapping of the BCS (1957) Hamiltonian of superconductivity, reducing it to a mean-field Hamiltonian of XY (or effectively Ising) model in a transverse field. Then we get the mean-field estimate for the equilibrium gap in the ground state energy at different temperatures (gap disappearing at the transition temperature), which fits Landau's (1949) phenomenological theory of superfluidity. We then present in detail a general dynamical extension of the mean-field theory of quantum Ising systems (in a transverse field), following de Gennes' (1963) decomposition of the mean field into orthogonal classical cooperative (longitudinal) component and the quantum (transverse) component, with each of the components following Suzuki-Kubo (1968) mean-field dynamics. Next we discuss its applications to quantum hysteresis in Ising magnets (in presence of oscillating transverse field), to quantum heat engines (employing transverse Ising model as working fluid), and to the quantum annealing of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (1975) spin glass by tuning down (to zero) the transverse field which provided us a very fast computational algorithm leading to ground state energy values converging to the best known analytic estimate for the model. Finally, we summarize the main results obtained and conclude about the effectiveness of the de Gennes-Suzuki-Kubo mean-field equations for the study of various dynamical aspects of quantum condensed matter systems.</p>

            <p>To investigate the scope of ferroelectric behavior in La-substituted BiFeO3 films, LaxBi1-xFeO3 epitaxial films were synthesized using off-axis co-sputtering on SrTiO3(001) and DyScO3(110) substrates with a SrRuO3 bottom electrode layer. A digital-doping deposition method was used to enable precise control and continuous tuning of La concentration in high-quality LaxBi1-xFeO3 films across a wide range of x = 0.05-0.60, which was systematically investigated using piezoresponse force microscopy. Robust and reversible out-of-plane ferroelectric switching has been observed up to x = 0.35, while films with x $\geq$ 0.37 exhibit no measurable ferroelectric behavior, indicating a sharp ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition between x = 0.35 and 0.37. This represents the highest reported La concentration in LaxBi1-xFeO3 films that retains ferroelectric ordering, highlighting opportunities to engineer ferroelectric and multiferroic properties in complex oxide heterostructures.</p>

            <h2>Anomalous terahertz nonlinearity in disordered s-wave superconductor close to the superconductor-insulator transition</h2>

            <p>Detection of the Higgs mode in superconductors using nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy is a key area of interest in condensed matter physics. We investigate the influence of disorder on the nonlinear terahertz response and the Higgs mode in NbN thin films with varying Ioffe-Regel parameters ($k_Fl$). In strongly disordered films near the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT), we observe an anomalous third-harmonic generation (THG) signal above $T_c$, which is absent in both cleaner superconducting and non-superconducting counterparts. The persistence of this normal-state THG signal in a high magnetic field excludes superconducting fluctuations as its origin. Below $T_c$, the THG intensity increases sharply, indicating a dominant contribution from the driven Higgs mode. The THG spectrum of the strongly disordered sample exhibits a broadened, multi-peak structure, which we attribute to quantum path interference between distinct channels involving unpaired electrons and Cooper pairs within emergent superconducting islands. Our findings not only demonstrate how disorder tunes the nonlinear terahertz response but also uncover a strong coupling between electrons responsible for normal-state THG and the superconducting Higgs mode below $T_c$ in strongly disordered samples.</p>

            <p>Designing heterogeneous, self-assembling systems is a central challenge in soft matter and biology. We present a framework that uses gradient-based optimization to invert an analytical yield calculation, tuning systems toward target equilibrium yields. We design systems ranging from simple dimers to temperature-controlled shells to polymerizing systems, achieving precise control of self- and non-self-limiting assemblies. By operating directly on closed-form calculations, our framework bypasses trajectory-based instabilities and enables efficient optimization in otherwise challenging regimes.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sebastiano Battisti, Matteo Pioldi, Alessandro Paghi, Giorgio De Simoni, Alessandro Braggio, Giulio Senesi, Lucia Sorba, Francesco Giazotto</p>
            <p>We present a groundbreaking demonstration of thermal modulation in a field-effect-controllable semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure, wherein the heating mechanism is exclusively radiative. The architecture comprises two reservoirs separated by $\sim 1$ mm and interconnected via a completely non-galvanic electrical circuit, enabling the transfer of black-body radiation from the hot to the cold reservoir. Our device utilizes a superconducting Josephson field-effect transistor to achieve magnetic-field-free gate-tunable regulation of heat currents within the circuit. While prior studies have indicated the potential for electrostatic modulation of thermal transport properties, our framework demonstrates a temperature modulation of up to $\sim 45$ mK, exceeding prior findings by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, it proves a thermal transimpedance of $\sim 20$ mK/V at a bath temperature of $30$ mK. The development of such systems holds substantial promise for advancing heat management and routing in quantum chips and radiation sensors, as it enables precise nonlocal control of heat flow towards a designated structure, even when the heat source is distant and non-galvanically coupled.</p>

            <h2>Hydrogenated Aluminum Doped Zinc Oxide as Highly Transparent and Passivating Indium-Free Recombination Junction for TOPCon-Based Bottom Cell</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Gökhan Altıner, Jons Bolding, Yiğit Mert Kaplan, Floor Souren, Hindrik de Vries, Raşit Turan, Hisham Nasser</p>
            <p>Tandem solar cells offer a promising alternative to exceed the efficiency limits of single-junction silicon photovoltaics, yet they require high-performance recombination junctions that are transparent, passivating, and electrically efficient. Indium tin oxide (ITO), which is conventionally used as a recombination junction material, faces challenges related to indium scarcity and sputter-induced damage. This work investigates hydrogenated aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO:H) deposited by spatial atomic layer deposition (s-ALD) as a viable indiumfree alternative for TOPCon-based bottom cells. The deposited AZO:H films demonstrate excellent transparency, exceeding 90% in the 380-1200 nm wavelength range. When applied to n-TOPCon surfaces with an AlOx capping layer, the stack achieves an outstanding passivation quality, indicated by implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) values up to 734 mV after annealing. The AlOx capping layer proved crucial for enhancing thermal stability by preventing hydrogen effusion at higher temperatures. While the contact resistivity was high for the 20 nm thick films tested, the combination of superior optical and passivation properties establishes spatial ALD-deposited AZO:H as a highly promising material for creating efficient and indiumfree recombination junctions in next-generation tandem solar cells.</p>

            <h2>Curvature instability of an active gel growing on a wavy membrane</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kristiana Mihali, Dennis Wörthmüller, Pierre Sens</p>
            <p>Cell shape changes are largely controlled by the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic filament network beneath the plasma membrane. Several cell types can form extended free-standing protrusions not supported by an extracellular substrate or matrix, and regulated by proteins that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics in a way sensitive to the curvature of the cell membrane. We develop a theoretical model for the mechanics of a free-standing viscous actin network growing on a corrugated membrane. The model couples the dynamics of the viscous active gel with membrane deformation and the recruitment of curvature-sensitive actin nucleators. We show that an actin layer polymerising uniformly on the membrane always exerts a stabilising effect that reduces membrane deformation. However, curvature-sensitive actin nucleator proteins can render the membrane linearly unstable, depending on the interplay between membrane and actin dynamics, giving rise to spontaneous membrane deformation which could initiate extended free-standing cellular protrusion.</p>

            <h2>The advancement of Brillouin Light Scattering with the assistance of nanoplasmonic structures. Enhancement and amplification</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> E. Bortchagovsky, A.V. Chumak, V. Lozovski</p>
            <p>Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is a key technique in studying magnonic systems, but its sensitivity is often limited. While nanoplasmonic systems can enhance BLS through near-field effects, we propose a novel approach for additional amplification. In this conceptual paper, we show how to actively supply energy to a surface collective electromagnetic resonance (SCR) supported by a sparse layer of metal nanoparticles on a magnetic film. Proposed methods are designed to significantly amplify the efficiency of surface-enhanced Brillouin light scattering without increasing the intensity of the primary excitation. In the proposed scheme, the pump extends the propagation length of the SCR, leading directly to BLS amplification. We analyze the conditions for such amplification, with numerical estimates indicating a potential gain of more than an order of magnitude in the surface-wave amplitude. This gain far surpasses the modest increase achievable through passive enhancement alone. These findings outline a practical pathway to achieving BLS amplification in integrated magnonic platforms.</p>

            <h2>Active polymers translocate faster in confinement</h2>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. R. Prathyusha, Paulami Sarkar, Justin Xu, Saad Bhamla</p>
            <p>Living organisms employ diverse strategies to navigate confined environments. Inspired by translocation observations on California blackworms (\textit{Lumbriculus variegatus}), we combine biological experiments and active-polymer simulations to examine how confinement and stiffness govern translocation. Active filaments translocate fastest when the channel width is comparable to their diameter, with escape time determined by propulsion speed, filament length, and channel geometry. In wider channels, activity and flexibility induce reorientation-dominated conformational changes that prolong escape. A single dimensionless ratio linking confinement to stiffness captures the transition from axis-aligned escape with short wall deflections for stiffer filaments, to reorientation-controlled motion with blob-like shapes for flexible filaments. These results provide a unified physical framework for active translocation in confinement and suggest design principles for flexible robotic filaments in complex environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicolas Harmand, Julien Dervaux, Christophe Poulard, Sylvie Hénon</p>
            <p>We measured the thickness of MDCK epithelia grown on substrates with a sinusoidal profile. We show that while at long wavelength the profile of the epithelium follows that of the substrate, at short wavelengths cells are thicker in valleys than on ridges. This is reminiscent of the so-called « healing length » in the case of a thin liquid film wetting a rough solid substrate. We explore the ability of continuum mechanics models to account for these observations. Modeling the epithelium as a thin liquid film, with surface tension, does not fully account for the measurements. Neither does modeling the epithelium as a thin incompressible elastic film. On the contrary, the addition of an apical active stress gives satisfactory agreement with measurements, with one fitting parameter, the ratio between the active stress and the elastic modulus.</p>

            <p>The cerium iso-structural phase transition (gamma to alpha) is dominated by f-electron localization changes that results in a magnetic ordering change and a volume collapse. Generally, these physics are difficult to capture with ab initio and first principles methods. However, previous works have shown various methods to be successful in predicting at least some of the physics of the gamma to alpha phase transition. Therefore, here, we perform a broad survey of density functional based methods across three levels of theory and types of functions (GGA, MetaGGA, and Hybrid functionals) and compare the results, focusing on hydrostatic compression across the phase boundary at zero Kelvin. For the methods that best reproduce experimental results, we directly probe the predicted mechanisms and frame the results in the Mott/Kondo debate, assessing how the underlying methods and assumptions of different functionals can assess the physical drivers in the phase transition, providing insight into the governing dynamics of this unique phase transition.</p>

            <p>This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends. Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS - 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1 exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).</p>

            <p>In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</p>

            <p>Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</p>

            <p>Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining. Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and powerful tool.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karol Sajnok, Michał Matuszewski</p>
            <p>Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence, establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which system control is restricted to local parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Leopoldo A. Pando Zayas, Jingchao Zhang</p>
            <p>Near-extremal black holes are known to contain strong quantum fluctuations in their near-horizon near-AdS$_2$ throat region governed by an effective action that includes Schwarzian modes. These fluctuations lead to one-loop corrections in the gravitational path integral that are essential in understanding the thermodynamics of near-extremal black holes at low temperatures where they become more dominant that the semi-classical answer. We explore the implications of these quantum fluctuations for near-extremal asymptotically AdS$_4$ black branes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We note that at one-loop level there is a coupling of the shear gravitational fluctuations to one of the would-be zero modes. This coupling affects the retarded Green's function in a way that leads to a low temperature violation of the shear viscosity to entropy density bound.</p>
